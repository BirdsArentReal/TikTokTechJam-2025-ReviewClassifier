"This was a very horrible car wash experience. I was disappointed I even went to a drive through wash. I bought the silver wash 19.00. The truck behind me also had a horrible wash. I witnessed one employee mocking behavior not prespraying around the truck instead pretend working in a mocking way. My mirror was almost pulled of drivers side and two long scratch gouges were left on paint area of mirror.
When I spoke to the other employee about my truck still being dirty the scratched and that I witnessed the mock spraying ( he was award as he was there also) no one spoke to me I had no option to say a word also they had two of us trucks so close together I couldn’t even blow dry truck.
This is a new car wash at the old duck pond location I wish they had rebuilt the do it your self  at wash stalls as I felt disrespected and ripped off.. yes I was offered to go through again ... no thank you I was afraid of more scratches.

"Slow, boring ride is the least of my dissatisfaction with this trip.
I especially was upset with the bait and switch of my son's ability to drive. I asked specifically on the phone if 16 with a permit can ride and was assured it would not be a problem. Our tour guide went out of her way to ask again after giving us a safety brief and came back with a no. This was the main reason we decided to do this trip.
The equipment we drove was well maintained and comfortable. The route is on public land on service roads most 2 wheel drive trucks would not have a problem driving. We went about 10 maybe 15 miles an hour.
The views are marginally better than roadside of Healy, Beth and a couple other mountains. We heard the same explanation of burlesque dancers being the source of the names of the mountains multiple times. The worst part of the trip was when Rachel from  South Carolina (?!!!???) gave us a moving 15 minute update of the poor, poor status of the local community needlessly hunting down and slaughtering predators in their dens for 10s of thousands of dollars; implying the all that profit flows to the greedy evil guides, ignoring the large majority of that income flows to the State and federal park service for maintaining the scenic views we were enjoying.

Then to a dry river bed where we had an elementary explanation of rocks that should have excited us for the 30 minute stop at this rock bed.
Wes was very professional and didn't rant about topics he knew nothing about.
As a local to Alaska that lives here year around I remember when the villages were asking for permissions to kill the predators because the wolf population was out of control and were killing sled dogs and livestock. We don't need out of state activists trying to tie our hands at protecting our property.
Save your money for this waste of your time. The same company operates the zip line and other tours that are worth the expense.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Quality and consistanty of their signature items, ie. salmon dip, and pizza, was top notch for awhile but has dropped over the years. What was once a perfectly cooked pizza is now often burned unevenly on the crust or salmon dip is way to cold. But when you are serving a mass amount of people this becomes difficult. I'm afraid this once great restraunt is unable to keep up with it's own popularity. The staff is still very friendly, and do their best to serve you. Although this once was one of my favorite places, we now pass on it, to head somewhere else local.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"My wife and I camped here over Labor Day weekend in a 26ft travel trailer. It took some creative skills to get my trailer parked safely as some of the pads are short, and many of the back up angles are terrible, but it's a great escape, just outside of town. It feels like you're in the shire surrounded by beautiful greens and nature everywhere. The lake is stocked with rainbow trout and the grayling are eager to chow down on anything you cast into the lake.",Taste,,None,

"Ok... so how does this work?  This place transferred hands a ways back and was purchased (to my understanding) by some our friends from south of the boarder. I was hesitant to return fearing an influence that is just too common here in Anchorage and I’m my humble opinion the same things just prepared differently and then renamed.  But to my wonderful surprise these guys are pulling of some great American style food. I’ve eaten many items from the menu and have been pleased or even ecstatic about what I received. Now I’m not comparing this with Club Paris or Crows Nest, but if you are looking for some great home style cooking you have to give this little place a shot. It is just another example of the hidden gems we have here in Anchorage tucked away in strip malls. ( Think Jens or Campabellas). Keep up the good work.",Taste,Variety,,

"My first time here during the mandates by the mayor banning indoor dining. The food was reasonably good.  However we were ordered ground beef in our salad and received shredded which included an upcharge.  We also were not informed that using a credit card would result in a credit card fee. Although not unreasonable at 3% (standard rate charged by credit card companies to the business) this is the only place we had encountered the charge and there were no signs or information regarding this charge provided before or during our meal.  We only knew about it at the end of our meal when we saw it listed on the receipt.  While we want to help out local businesses trying to stay alive through all this, correct orders and full cost disclosures are important as well.",Quality,Price,,

Personally I think the food is better than the coffee, but none of it is bad. Service is always good, but Ravens Brew coffee is not a good coffee IMO. The food is tasty and on Fridays stop by for their brisket.

"(Translated by Google) Nice activity in Fairbanks. It takes 2 hours. Some explanations on the pipeline which crosses Alaska from North to South. You can see a stretch when you arrive. Covered little train ride but no windows so in rainy weather, it is better to equip yourself. A musician plays some country tunes with his guitar and his violin, it s very nice to be patient before everyone climbs up (many buses when we are gone). A pioneer-like bearded man tells us the story of the region's gold diggers and the techniques for recovering gold. Then it's up to us to try the adventure! It s cheerful and everyone leaves with their little bundle of gold sequins. We can then have it weighed. Souvenir shops well stocked. Free coffee, tea, water and delicious cookies !!!

Sympathique activité à Fairbanks. Il faut compter 2h. Quelques explications sur le pipeline qui traverse l Alaska du Nord au Sud.   On peut voir un tronçon quand on arrive. Trajet en petit train couvert mais pas de fenêtres donc par temps pluvieux, mieux vaut bien s équiper. Un musicien joue quelques airs de country avec sa guitare et son violon,  c est très agréable pour patienter avant la montée de tout le monde (de nombreux cars quand nous sommes allés). Un barbu genre pionnier nous raconte l histoire des chercheurs d'or de la région  et les techniques pour récupérer l'or. C est ensuite à nous de tenter l aventure! C est gaie et chacun repart avec son petit paquet de paillettes d or. On peut le faire peser ensuite. Boutiques de souvenirs bien fournies.

"We've had nothing but issues with Loving companions since I adopted a cat from there. This cat only weighed 5 lbs and was about dead when I bought her. Turns out she was starving to death and needed surgery to fix the issue. Donna denied anything was wrong with her, claiming they had her a month and she ate just fine. After a long phone battle, they begrudgingly paid for her surgery. 2 weeks later and this cat is still sick and miserable. After 3 vet visits, we're looking At putting her down because her quality of life is seriously lacking. Don't adopt from here until the animals get better care!

"We did the walk on the wild side tour and it was definitely worth the price, even though the weather was pretty bad. It was ice all morning and then rain the rest of the time, but our guide Brandy was great and took time to make sure we were safe on the ice. We got to feed a few animals and get pretty close to others. There weren't many people there, so it was nice to be able to just hang with the animals and not have too many people around while we toured. At the end, we got to howl with the wolves and all 4 of them started howling. It was amazing to hear. Would definitely recommend it! Great that there were also 2 different bathroom areas (not outhouses haha) and the gift shop was nice. PLEASE don't go here and taunt the animals. Go here in peace and to observe them. Also, don't try to touch or feed them unless you are supervised by a guide. We did the special tour, so that's why you see us doing that. Respect how amazing these creatures are.",Taste,Price,,

Almost a full month to find out I was lied to directly. Almost a full month to hear from the lenders that I had been approved under their modified terms.
Almost a full month later, now aware of this, I go back to the dealership and to my face I'm told:

""I wasn't involved, what do you want me to do.""

What. In. The. ""Heck.""

I don't know what happened to this once fantastic dealer, but there are a plethora of options to be treated like garbage in the valley and Anchorage area with at least a better deal. Its almost like the other options are intrested in, well, doing honest business.

The staff is always great, but if I might add my only criticism, it's the sub-par selection of incense.

"Absolutely delicious. It's a small place, with a center bakery cabinet and shelves with goods, and seating for about 25. Very clean. Nice tablecloths and napkins. An upscale bistro feel. The menu is locally sourced as much as possible, with organic and minimally processed ingredients. There was a good selection of food; this week it happened to be burgers and salads with an incredible drink menu of coffee, chocolate, and chai-like items. The food flavor combinations were very interesting, we had  roasted brussel sprouts with spicy peanut sauce on a beet-wheat bun and it was DELICIOUS! I also had a kefir and wild blueberry smoothie, also great. Service was wonderful. Owner is the chef and is quite friendly. More expensive than your average restaurant, this is not a Red Robin or Outback Steakhouse place, and would not be a good substitute for people looking for that sort of experience. It is approptiately priced. Not really a kid-friendly place, or geared towards kids. Saw no high chairs, etc. Fine dining.

"Pretty average considering the price.

The rooms are spacious but the amenities sparse, and no view in most. The window AC was just powerful enough to cool the rooms in July. The quality of the room furnishings was average. Housekeeping was intrusive, they would knock and enter immediately, without announcing.

The breakfast, if purchased with the room, is not a buffet. Instead, a voucher is given which can be used to get an entree from a limited menu.

On the plus side, the staff was friendly, the location was good, the view of the lake from behind the hotel was amazing. The seaplanes were fun to watch, but they did make a lot of noise in the morning.",Quality,Customer Service,,

"(Translated by Google) Great tasty food that is prepared quickly. On our first visit we were completely satisfied with everything.

However, on our second visit the service was not that good. Despite not even half full restaurant. The dishes of guests who had long since left stood around on the tables and the drinks ordered were not brought. If you had wishes, you had to go ahead and express them yourself, as nobody came to the table. The people in the kitchen and at the reception also acted like schoolchildren and kept making strange noises and talking to themselves. It doesn't have to be in front of the guests! The need for improvement in the service team would be very good.

Despite everything, the food was good and freshly prepared. We also found it good that there was free access to WiFi.

Tolles leckeres Essen, was schnell zubereitet wird. Bei unserem ersten Besuch waren wir voll zufrieden mit allem.

Bei unserem zweiten Besuch allerdings war der Service nicht so gut. Trotz nicht mal halb vollen Restaurant. Das Geschirr von längst gegangen Gästen stand ewig auf den Tischen rum und die bestellten Getränke wurden nicht gebracht. Wenn man Wünsche hatte, musste man selber vor gehen und diese äußern, da niemand zum Tisch kam. Auch die Leute in der Küche und an der Annahme benahmen sich wie Schulkinder und machten ständig komische Geräusche und Fachsen unter sich. Das muss nicht sein, vor den Gästen! Verbesserungbedarf beim Serviceteam wäre ganz gut.

Trotz allem war das Essen gut und frisch zubereitet. Gut fanden wir auch, dass es dort einen kostenlosen Zugang zum WLAN gab.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"What a beautiful place! It's kinda tucked away at one of Juneau, but once you find it, it's worth the drive. The church is extremely pretty and the surrounding area is gorgeous.

You do not need to be religious to come here. It sits right off of the bay and you can see the surrounding mountains. I was lucky enough to see several Orca Pods swim by while I was there. It is a great place to visit.",Taste,,None,

"Absolutely perfect....here's why:  my wife broke her jaw a few weeks ago and she was feeling better so we went for a drive to Talkeetna.  She still can't chew yet, so we were hoping for a good soup, but also wondered if they would mash up something that's already on the menu, so that she wouldn't have to chew it very much.  Oh man...the reindeer sausage meatloaf!  The chef smashed it up, put the gravy on it, then put some nice creamy mashed potatoes on the side, with more gravy.  We paired that with a lovely assortment of micro-boozes and had a great meal.

I had the pulled pork sammich.....it changed my life.  I now enjoy coleslaw thanks to them.  The sweet potatoes fries are the best i have ever had.

I will continue to support this great restaurant/brewery and I suggest you take the trip out there at least once a year.

Slow down brown might be my favorite beer from them.  Or the slugger.  Or the chuli, or the fall harvest. Or the berry and wheat.",Taste,Variety,,

The chef and the entire staff definitely know what they are doing.  The only hiccup was with the hostess that wasn't able to give us a wait time (which turned out to be 5 minutes).

"Always a highlight on the Fur Rondy schedule the Snow Sculpture competition is great fun. Going at night the night before judging is even more fun because the lights against the dark backdrop contour the designs so well. I spoke with a few of the carvers and they all commented on what a great time they have conceptualizing their themes and plans and the executing them in the week before judging. Steve encouraged us to sign up next year, as registration is open to anyone who wants to give it a try. The group from the Best Buddies Club said that they are friends who have come together each year, for over 16 years, to brave the cold and sculpt together. Division One Winner’s compete on Team Alaska at the US Nationals, so the artists go all out. There is also a People’s Choice Award...so stop by to vote!

Just bought a 2015 Silverado at this lot yesterday. Our salesman was Matt. Every car buying experience should be like it was at Affordable Used Cars. It wasn't a big fancy lot so I was hesitant. I always go to a car lot knowing exactly what I want and it's frustrating having a commissioned salesman trying to get me to by what is best for him. No need to worry about that at this lot. There's no pressure just cruise the lot decide what you want and let them know. Their prices are more than fair and they gave me fair trade in value for my car. Matt was very professional and honest.  After I decided what truck I wanted I was out the door in about an hour. The only complaint I had about the whole experience was the fuel gauge was on empty. Not a deal breaker just always had dealerships give me a full tank. I will recommended this car lot to anyone who is looking for a great deal on a great vehicle.,Taste,Price,,

"Careful if you have allergies to cod. Order Californian roll for my wife. The menu never states that there is imitation crab in the roll. If you aren't aware imitation crab is not crab at all. Imitation crab is made from cod. My son is severely allergic to crab. My son had never tried sushi before. My wife and I not knowing that there was imitation crab in the roll let our son have some. Minutes after his throat started to swell shut. When we asked the waitress about the roll, she nonchalantly said that there was imitation crab like we should have known. Because we didn't have a epi pen with us we got up in the middle of the meal in a rush to get in the car and get home to our epi pen. The Korean gentleman, who I take was the owner insisted that I pay before I leave. He acted like it wasn't a big deal and took his time processing or bill. When I mentioned that his restaurant poisoned our son he acted as if it was my fault for not knowing that there was imitation crab in the roll.
Just in case you are wondering Ichiban on Tudor road does not use imitation crab. There crab is real. There menu also states where items do have potential allergies.

"From the reviews I've read, seems like people don't understand, this is a 24 hour >emergency< vet... If you bring your pet here, without an appointment, you're going to wait... The first time I came here (years ago), I sat in the lobby, patiently, for 6 1/2 hours (it wasn't an emergency & I was happy to do so for the health of my pet, altho it was probably uncomfortable for him) recently I brought my cat here, waited in the parking lot for about 4 1/2 hours, after being updated that an emergency had showed up & my wait was going to be longer. Unfortunately he was diagnosed with carcinoma. Two weeks later he passed away, in my arms, at home. I called to ask them what to do, after it happened & they said I could bring him in & they could take care of him (I did end up taking him directly to the cremation place tho). Despite everyone there being over worked, tired, & probably sad having to deal with stress & death & crazy pet people (myself included) they have always been empathetic & patient with me. Yesterday I got a simpathy card, signed by all the staff for my boy. This place is 5 star, idc what anyone else says!",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

The ski resort facilities are excellent.
The pool was open until midnight and it was warm, so it was great to swim with your child.
There are several restaurants in the hotel, but it was expensive. It is also recommended to walk down the town or by car.

Both as stated before were very good.  We ending up having some friendly chat and the server showed us their dinner menu.  We decided to come back for dinner, and glad we did.  We split some clam chowder and two entrees.  One was the braised pork shank, and the other was the roast. We also had an appetizer of the sea scallops.  The meals that we had were over the top, perfect size and infused with different flavors.  I will highly recommend anyone going to Fairbanks to take the 15 minute drive to the Silver Gulch and have a meal you will not be disappointed.

"It's been years since I've been, but I have been to Sara many times for hair extensions. The experience was amazing every single time, with results that blew me away. Those who didn't know me personally (of course friends&family noticed my hair went from chin to low back overnight) had no idea my hair was anything but natural. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend her! Prices are up front and more than fair for extensions, and the skill here is incredible. Using the microbead method, taking the time to do it RIGHT, and creating a friendly and epic experience, I will be going back in the future. Even if I lived in Anchorage, I would make the trip to 27 Red for this service just to know with confidence that the end result will look great and last a good long while!

"(Translated by Google) The museum dedicates shop windows to the various native Alaskan towns. Inside the museum there are positions of artists and artisans who make and sell their products. Outside, there are recreations of the different types of housing, mostly underground and snow, made of wood, with ingenious protected entry and exit accesses, and a pleasant forest, with totem sculptures.

Half a star. Checked into their check in online. Showed 60 minutes. Go run a few errands show up and right before I walk in the door with my daughter she deleted my daughter's name. My daughter is 16 months old. We wait for these other people to get their hair cuts was told her hair doesn't look done but come back within 7 days to finish it. Still having to pay for a trim. And they said they thought I was getting my hair cut or they wouldn't have let her wait so long. Like does it matter my daughter was second to next and she deleted her name. Very poor she doesn't know their own check in program. Get your eyes checked lady,Customer Service,,None,

"5 stars for service and atmosphere and a few of my favorite brews. That being said, I dont have much micro brew experience. I know all of our beer tenders and alot of our locals enjoy a pint or 2 after work most days. 2 PINT MAX.  ITS GREAT! Sometimes too noisy but avoid ""HAPPY HOUR"" and afternoons are peaceful and weekends vary. This is a great spot for a short social with friends and pooches ( yes, dogs allowed on a leash and good behavior) and little ones too ( no leash, but well behaved and with parents always) 🙂. Enjoy a sample if your not sure. Like something and dont want to hang, get a growler to go or a ""medicine bottle"".T shirts, hoodies and souvenir glasses and other swag.

"Shopped at 5th Ave Mall on 7/10/2018.  Needed to use a restroom while on the 2nd floor.  Was told there were none on the 2nd floor and to go up to the 3rd floor.  When I entered the 3rd floor women’s restroom, all the stalls were occupied by young women doing drugs.  They would not speak or make any attempts to leave.  Security was contacted.  They came and stood by the outer door until the addicts were done and left.  Numerous shoppers, some with children, were turned away during this time.  No one wanted to use the stalls after them anyway.  Those of us who couldn’t hold it were directed to the restroom at Nordstroms.  This isn’t the first time I’ve seen addicts in the 5th Ave Mall.  I like some of the stores but it will be a long time before I venture back.  Don’t feel safe and also tired of paying to park.",Experience,,None,

"Dimond Center is a great place to do pretty much anything in Anchorage, Alaska from Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner type food vendor's,Fresh Fruit Smoothies and Ice Cream, to head to toe new, hip and trendy clothing, apparel, footwear and accessories from all the well-known clothing companies such as; American Eagle, Aeropostale, Pac Sun, Zumiez, Old Navy, Forever 21, Gap, Hot Topic and H&M. If you are not there for food or clothing don't worry, Dimond Center has Video Game, Hobby& Comic book and Electronics stores like Game Stop, Boscos and Best Buy. Also a full size Movie Theater, ice skating rink, Arcades, Bowling Alley, A Fully decked out Recreation Center for  teens and young adults and a full size fitness center with a pool. You can also find  armed forces recruiting stations and pull tabs lounges For older, legally aged customers. Compared to other mall's, especially in the big cities of the lower 48, Dimond Center is rather small and compacted. However, the compact design is rather helpful in most cases, all the stores and vendors within eye sight of one another makes for a quick, convenient and easy shopping experience. All of the staff and employees are always happy, cheerful and eager to help, greeting you at the door with a smile and a,""Welcome come on in.""and ""How can we help."" Dimond Center is a very safe and family friendly environment great for friends, family and kids of all ages. They have full time security guards patrolling inside and out along with a security room where they can observe all goings on inside throughout every store inside and out, from the outer doors and perimeter and up and down all the Isles of there massive parking lots. I can honestly say that I have never seen or heard of an incident where the security guards or the APD had to get involved occurring at Dimond Center. I can only think of one slightly negative observation/experience I can attest to at Dimond Center and that is because Dimond Center is smaller but still has pretty much all the same stores and attractions as a big city mall, it can get really busy and slightly crowded, especially around the Holidays.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"There's plenty to see every day. Today we watched the dog performers and shopped the vendors. My niece showed me her 4H displays and ribbons for her crafts wins. My uncle and I walked to the fair from his house a mile away which was good exercise. I was impressed by the clear explanation on the No Dogs Allowed sign. People need the law explained to them because dogs are animals - not children. A certified trained physical-support dog is legal. Emotional support dogs are illegal at the fair - they are untrained and go bonkers when they see any other dogs. This makes the work of a genuinely trained dog almost impossible because it has to guard its handler instead of supporting him. Also, working dogs don't socialize. I saw a man with his dog try to approach the dog performers after their show in order to ""greet"" them. This is proof of an untrained dog. Someone with a trained dog would never risk that. I don't know how he got into the fair. His dog had no vest. We need more signs like that, tho. Educate the public.",Quality,,None,

called the lady before I went in to see if they had openings for the day, and the price for a full set of matte blue acrylic nails. She told me it starts at $20 and ends at $40.

I was annoyed. I wasn’t going to say no because he was halfway finished so I said okay. I should’ve mentioned the lady on the phone told me $40 but I didn’t.

"Cool spot. Nice natural hot springs in the Alaska wilderness. Quite a few buildings make up this ""resort"". It's will built up. We started y in a dry cabin and it was pleasant.
A couple issues: inside every building is incredibly hot. Super hot. The restaurant was unbearably hot. The cabin was so hot we had to open up the windows to let it cool down. I guess it's hard to regulate the heat source, seeing as it's all naturally heated by circulating spring water. I wish the restaurant had windows to open.
Speaking of the restaurant, prepare to wait. I'm not sure if it's due to inadequate staffing, or just a nonchalant approach. Either way, takes about 15 minutes to be acknowledged, another 10 to 15 to be seated, and yet another 10 to 15 to get a server to notice you. After all the waiting, the food was good, beer selection was pretty good. Don't get mixed drinks. Moscow mule was not a mule.

The hot spring is cool. But the locker rooms are filthy. Super gross. Wear sandals, or flip flops. Do not enter barefoot.

"You haven't had Alaskan king crab until you've had Tracy's Alaskan king crab. A pretty fun joint with tasty craft root beer. But their namesake is why you should go. This isn't some tourist trap with mediocre food... No, Tracy's served up the largest, tastiest king crab I've ever (EVER!) had. Oh yeah, and their bisque and crab cakes were to die for, but took up space that should have been filled with another massive crab leg! The wait was a bit lengthy, but that just gave us a little more time to rest our feet. Too bad I didn't try Tracy's until my second visit to Juneau, but I will be back... I can't wait to go back!",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"We have been coming here for several years for dinner and our anniversary. I always have been very happy with the food and service. This time was our anniversary and I can say the new ownership has really disappointed us with the changes. If your going to up your prices then you don’t make the portions smaller? And my halibut used to be excellent this time there was no crab topping? It was BURNT very dry and thin as can be,  ate it with difficulty!!!!! The salad was all stems and bitter the dressing had no favor. Hardly any veggies and mashed potatoes??? The waiter was great and he felt so bad about my halibut that he gave us free cheesecake. It would be nice to know that you charge 7$ for a beer Plus 2$ more for the 21oz????? Which is crazy. Also every extra on your Steak? Or etc is plus $2???? And your not told about this lol we didn’t even get the steak topping. So sorry to say we will not be coming back again.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Need more employee's that know how to do more then stand around.

Everytime I go it's a horrible experience.
The only reason I keep going here is because when I order certain things this is the only location that has what I want.

But the 20 min wait for someone to come help me if they even show up is not worth it.

I had 3 different employees ask me if I needed help. Well I'm not just standing here for decoration.

All 3 employee's can't help me in the pickup department. Why is there only 1 person trained on how to unlock a locker and scan my items. And why is he never around.

The customer service has a line of about 12 people with only 1 cashier. Employee's walking past looking at her.

"ER is great, I've never had an issue, and never had to wait longer than a few minutes to be seen.  Check-in/Billing is tedious, especially when nothing had changed in years that needed to be reported.  They still had to ask the same questions over and over.  I utilized their lab during off hours, and check-in is in the ER after hours (5pm!).  This worked well for a while, but the ER is very obviously not helpful with checking in with the lab draws.  I waited 2 hours one time for just a lab draw because of ER triage and the ungodly long check-in process.  I must say though, they are fast....it's just a long process.  I stopped using their lab when I found out I can have the same tests done in 10 minutes at Quest.  Sadly though, my midnight blood draws are over.  I had surgery here!  It turned out well.  The doctor was a total jerk, but if you bring someone with you, they turn into saints.  (Just a helpful tip).  Being closest to me, I go there in an emergency, but generally, their doctors are rude, with bedside manner issues.  Ortho?  Forget it!  They're complete #$&holes.  I don't know why?  I think that they think they are God or something.  I had a terrible experience with a urologist there, he was SO rude I almost walked out.  He obviously didn't like anyone that was ""un-pure"".  I was chastised for decisions I made in my life 25 YEARS AGO!  Completely and utterly rude.  Ears Nose Throat doc was awesome though!  It's hit or miss there...

We have a 31 foot motorhome and can park in any of the campsites. There is designated tent sites as well. A clean and maintained camp that is $15 a night,  which is average for a dry camp here in Alaska. Stop by if you can.

"This place will treat you nice until you go to pick up your vehicle. After waiting an hour just to shake the hand of the person who sold me the truck online I finally get to see it and see it had not been washed. Then I got in and found kid toys and empty cigarette packs showing me they didn't bother cleaning the inside of the truck either. I sit there for a few min looking it over to get familiar with the dash and controls since they felt that hour I sat on their couch was better spent doing nothing. I start the truck up to find out the tank is half empty. You would think when you spend over $47,000 for a truck it should be clean and have a full tank of fuel. When my temp tags were about to expire I called up and asked about my new plates. I was told they were there waiting for me to pick up. No one decided to let me know. Since I live on an island in Alaska I told them they better hurry and send me the plates since they didn't bother to tell me they were in or send them out as soon as they got them. They had my full address and instructions from when I bought the truck. But I guess that is not how this place does business. I'd look elsewhere for a vehicle. They are nice until they have your money.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"I really enjoyed this place and visited twice during my vacation. It is a nicer but casual feel. The staff is friendly and communicated thoroughly on menu items.

I liked the Shrimp and Lobster Ravioli and Seafood Chowder most. My boyfriend had the crab legs, which I also tried. I prefer a more cajun style crab leg, but these were indeed ginormous! I didn't care for the crab much but my ravioli was 10/10. People seem to come here more for alcoholic drinks than dinner though, as everyone around me had a glass of wine or some other drink, with a salad or light meal.

My only complaints about this place are that the bathroom is extremely weird and annoying to access and the VERY wide price ranges. My ravioli was under $20, as were the other two pastas without meat, but you'll find items in the 30's and 40's range. The crab legs we tried we're $95 which I thought was a bit ridiculous.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"A place that's a pretty long drive from Fairbanks.  In the winter the road can be dangerous, so be careful.  The main attraction is the ""hot spring"". Though there is a spring on the premises,  the water is actually pumped into the rock pool from the spring.regardless, its not a bad way to spend the day.  The pool and indoor hot tubes are pretty lame, so just use the outside pool. There are lockers available for $.50 each use, and they're pretty small so dont bring any unnecessary items.  Plan to spend at least half a day here.  The food at the restaurant is like everything else in Alaska, pretty expensive.  So eat there at your own risk to your wallet.  Never stayed there, so I can't comment on the rooms, but the prices are up there.  There have other activities as well, just be ready to pay out for them.  All in all, not a bad way to spend a half to full day.",Restaurant,Price,,

"I hate that I keep going back!!  We have had the same experience with Christmas trees.  $150.00 is a lot for a Christmas tree in the first place, and then to go through the hassle of undecorating the redecorating and being treated as if we had been abusive to the tree, especially when 4 others there were also returning trees. Sadly, for the last 6 years we have had an artificial tree.  I end up going back after I swear I will never return. I have to agree with the other bloggers that the staff at both the Cranberry and DeArmoun Rd locations are about the rudest retailers in town. The problem is that they are the only retailers of products that I do enjoy, See's candy being one of them. I used to take my fuchsias (6 baskets) and begonias (4 baskets) there to winter over. I also used to order annual baskets. I did so for 3 years, paid in the fall. Then one year I went to pick them up and they were hosing them down before they were just left for me to carry to my truck. When I looked at my favorite pink marshmallow (besides the fact that it looked so sickly it should have been thrown away) it was covered, I mean covered in aphids. When I looked at the other plants I found them to be close to the same. I had to stand back in line and was rudely told that ""that was why they were hosing them off!! There is a aphid problem this year"". I asked about why were they not treated chemically and was told that they didn't use chemicals. Grrrrrr that is what I thought I was paying for!!! I was upset and refused the worst of the 12 baskets (I had 28 new tea roses that I did not need to have exposed the infestation) but was informed that I would still have to pay for them. They did offer to replant the annual baskets that were supposed to ""match"" but looked as if there was a 2 month growth difference, also insect infested. I did end up with constant treatment of malathion that year, but for the amount of $$$ that I had to pay I would have expected better service for both my plants and a customer. Maybe the sales staff should be on commission, they would be more helpful and friendly. Oh... btw, the ""back staff"" has always very pleasant and helpful, although it is helpful that I can speak Spanish :-)",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"Pikes Landing has a good selection of beer, and it has an amazing view of the river. You can also play a spendy game at their driving range, at a $1 per ball but it's kind of fun, especially when you land one on the green across the river. Service is good, except when things get busy. Then it's probably up to you to flag down your (probably overworked?) server. I spent a whole day here waiting for my evening flight at the airport.

"How can I describe such a wondrous, natural beauty? Everywhere you look it is so picturesque. I felt like I was almost in a different time while walking through the forest. Everything is so green! There are so many beautiful shades of green end the Fallen trees and overgrowth makes the forest appear like it is full of Modern Art or statues! Around each turn was a new, beautiful experience. It is definitely a place I recommend people visit, not only for its natural beauty, but for its spirituality and peacefulness. If you get a chance to steal a few moments to yourself, simply stop and listen to the birds chirping or the sound of the water lapping against the shore, the wind whistling through the trees, and just breathe. Then, and only then will you understand what a true blessing it is to be in such a beautiful place!",Restaurant,Experience,,

We had sparkling Rose and grapefruit sour beer, all excellent. Loved the lemon rice soup - very filling. Loved both halibut sandwiches. Could improve kids menu and the pasta. Kids menu: portions were very very small. I know kids are also small but ours can eat a whole steak so we had to order two orders of pasta. Also, the burger is a slider with a crusty bun that is so big a kid can't eat it. I tried scooping out the bread but by that point the kiddo was too upset. The pasta says it's in a light lemon cream sauce - the emphasis should be on lemon! Had the lemon been halved I could have eaten more but it was just too overwhelming. I would have liked to taste the garlic! Looks like they might have live bands and they have outside seating. Overall, we really liked it.",Taste,Ambiance,,

"What a downer , Saturday night. Door greeter super uptight about checking Id's , not welcoming at all. Our group felt like we were more of an annoyance . After long delay our waiter came to take our order, member from our group was tired of waiting so went directly to the bar to order drinks.  Politely I asked our waiter if he could wait a a few seconds so we  could stop our member from ordering drinks at the bar . Humpys waiter was instantly irritated  and walked away to another table. Been regulars at Humpys for years . Attitudes here have changed for the worse.   Gonna have to mark this place off our list. We stopped at other Irish pubs in town, just the opposite experience , warm welcoming staff , lots of smiles and complimentary food for St. Patrick's day. At least Anchorage has choices.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

I haven't attended a concert here, but friends tell me sound is great. The running/walking track is very nice. I'm not a fan of the fast food concession, but there are fresh food and prepped food stands provided by the Varsity Grill that are tasty.

We were a part of a large group that preordered food to be ready at a certain time. Wonderful idea because ordering food then waiting for several hours with kids can be horrible. But the tuna tacos were over cooked. I thought maybe it was due to the fact that we had a large group. When we asked the waitress she explained that when we ordered we had to tell the cook how we wanted the ahu tuna cooked and if we did not it would come fully cooked. WHAT! ahu tuna should never be cooked fully. The waitress said that it was just like the burgers pink or no pink. AHU TUNA SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY SEARED ON ALL SIDES AND LEFT ALONE. Restaurant chefs should know this however bar cooks do not. So if this is a bar then I can simply say I mistake however I consider this place a restaurant so the three stars because they offered preordering.,Taste,Customer Service,,

Over the last year we attended confirmation and faith formation classes at Sacred Heart. The RCIA journey for my son and I, who both have special needs and disabilities was life affirming. We were treated with such compassion, understanding and love. Father Joseph shares the word of the Lord in a way everyone can understand and relate too. This past Easter my son was Bapitized and we were welcomed as official members of the Catholic Church.

Everyone is so caring and welcoming. Very family friendly and community minded. There is so much love and acceptance in this church.

"One of the great and locally owned novelty and tobacco paraphernalia head shops in anchorage 🙌✌📌. This place has it all . I don't personally vape because I'm not sure I'm quite cool enough but if I did the have a wide variety of vape ecigs and juices for them ! They also carry a huge selection of cigarette rolling papers , whether you like smoking regular filtered cigarettes or Giant 2 oz cones when you smoke a cigarette they have everything in between also. If you're looking for a really nice glass tobacco pipe they have hand pipes all the way up to really fancy cylindrical water percolation device types . This awesome stor even carries novelty sex toy items.

If you're looking for a verity of meat and BBQ then you need to visit Texas Roadhouse.

Everything here tastes fantastic.  The BBQ Chicken Sandwich is my favorite item because it's cheap and simple.  The prices here are a little more expensive, so eat all the peanuts you can.  The bread rolls with the cinnamon butter are amazing too.

The employees occasionally will dance, so that's unique.  What I didn't realize is there is an outdoor seating area, but I've never been asked if I want to sit outside.  On a sunny day I will request to eat outside next time.

Bottomless non-alcoholic (soda & ice tea) drinks here.  Impossible to leave here dehydrated!

When you pull on the door handles they almost pull out
The driver seat had a huge hole in it from where a dog scratched at it couldn't notice it unless you like put your head under there
Looked like they tried to glue the driver handle on with glue and it ran down the door and now I have to paint the drivers door
The person that detailed it did the worst job ever and didn't wipe all the white stuff they strayed and didn't vacuum the soap off the floor boards good enough
Then went to replace my head lights and you have to take the head lights out and they were brokenot tabs and only 2 bolts holding them in and they wereally up top. Should have a total of 5 bolts holding them in and they cut the old headlights out and left the wires bare and did not close the wires right

"Local women's coop hand knitting all sorts of clothing: hats, scarfs, shawls, gloves, even dresses from musk ox wool. It's warmer than sheep wool, has no lanolin or itch and maintains its shape no matter what temperature of water it is washed in. A giant musk ox only produces about 5 pounds of this under coat, so it's not cheap. It is beautiful and you usually get to meet some of the knitters from the 21 remote communities involved. Each community uses different designs, which are explained. Not wheel chair accessible, but it's only 3 steps up and the shop is small, so our two people with limited mobility did fine.",Taste,Convenience,,

"UPDATE: I took my Van into the Chrysler dealership in Anchorage after getting it back from Midas. They replaced and repaired everything I requested from Midas within 24 hours. They also found no problems with ""codes"" or or anything else other than fuses that needed to be replaced, and one sensor that was broken. Funny how none of the ""huge problems"" that made my Van such a ""disaster"" according to Midas weren't found by the dealership. I highly recommend going elsewhere.

I dropped my 2014 Chrysler Town and Country off to you guys on July 28, 2020 last week. As of this coming Tuesday, you have had it a week, no one has called to update me, and every time I have called I've been told you're still doing diagnostics. I was told no matter where I take it it has ""a lot of problems"" and you're still diagnosing them. No specifics, just that your ""guy"" was still looking at it. I would like someone to AT LEAST tell me what all these ""problems"" are by tomorrow, or I will be arranging to take it somewhere else. I brought it in saying I needed new brakes, new tires, and to please check the sensors to see what's wrong. Now I don't know if it's because I'm female, but I will not be strung along and it is driveable and able to be taken elsewhere. I would like YOU, who are charging me over $300 for diagnostics to be done(as of the 28th- I'm sure you've added to that) to give ME a call tomorrow, Monday, August 3, 2020, with an answer as to what exactly is taking so long to diagnose my vehicle, especially when I made an appointment beforehand. This is unacceptable and I'm sure you have finished work on other vehicles in this last week. The least I expect after a week of being home bound with no car, after making an appointment, is a follow up call telling me what ""a lot of problems"" SPECIFICALLY means. And even then, I will probably be taking it elsewhere to get my tires and brakes at this point. I'm pretty sure it won't take an entire week for another shop to simply tell me WHAT needs to be fixed. To my understanding you have not performed ANY work yet on my vehicle, and therefore have caused me more problems by keeping it for so long. I would like to add that I do have a lawyer as well. Either tell me what is SPECIFICALLY wrong with it,  give my vehicle back so I can find a more competent auto shop, or I'll be having my lawyer contact you. Thanks, I guess.",Taste,Experience,,

"If I could give them negative stars I would. I have never seen a place as sketchy and questionable as Gene’s. Not only do they have poor customer service but I bet they don’t even fully inspect the used vehicles that they put on the sales floor. You would think that because they are a dealership that they would fully inspect the vehicle and make sure to check and double check everything to make sure that it runs properly. Their customer service is a joke, between answering phone calls whilst in a conversation with you or just completely ignoring your requests, they are essentially just rude and careless. They just care about securing their commission and if that means that they put you in a faulty vehicle then that’s what they will do. Even after expressing my frustration and concerns they just kept saying that they couldn’t do anything for me and then turn around and say that they just want to make their customers happy to then still say they can’t help you. They have had my vehicle from 8:30 until 4:30 to tell me that a cap was broken, something that should have been noticed and fixed before putting the vehicle on the sales floor. Every person that I have spoken to about my experience with Gene’s and their employees they all have told me that they are the worst people to work with when it comes to purchasing a vehicle. I just wish I would have known this before even thinking about going to them.",Location,Customer Service,,

This restaurant is as old as I am. That means that it has done a good job feeding the people of Anchorage and they've done it for a long time. It has that old Mexican Villa feel the food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. The Margaritas were yummy and the service was great. This was the first time that we've eaten at La Mex but it will not be the last. Very nice place to enjoy Mexican food,Taste,Customer Service,,
"This rental car business is great. They have very reasonable prices and their cars are pretty well taken care of considering its Anchorage, meaning some dings and scratches and nicks in the windshield but still nice and drive straight. I also like that it was blue tooth compatible so I could listen to music from my phone and use Google maps and it would talk through the car stereo. Check out and check in were a breeze.",Taste,Price,,

"I like the over the phone payment system, except you have to wait for that lady to go through all the same stuff EVERYTIME... It was an easy process to start service & I didn't have to go see anyone in person, which was nice... I had a bit of a time trying to pre-pay on my bill tho, when the woman on the phone told me she couldn't bring up my account because my service hadn't started yet... So I never did get to pre-pay on my bill because the money ended up getting used for other bills before they could bring up my account... But, they sure don't waste time sending you a shut off notice, my bill this month was over $300, last month $340!!! & over half of that is FEES for THEIR stuff... fuel for their plant $71, other misc fees $50+... I was happy that it was only $25 to start service (down in Kenai it was $200), but now I know why... I know people  who own houses & their gas AND electric bills together don't run this high! & THEN if your service is shut off, it's $41 to get it turned back on DURING business hours ONLY or $87 after hours & $372!!! for a call-out reconnect, whatever that is... It's just stupid that they're the ONLY electric company, so you can't go anywhere else & you HAVE to pay all their stupid fees... Even if I had a full time job at $15/hr I couldn't afford a $300+ electric bill on top of my rent! We only have the heat on in ONE room in our apartment, no computers, LED light bulbs, 2 ECOSmart TVs that auto-shut off after a set amount of time & we only use cold water in our washing machine & don't even use the dishwasher! We even shut off the water to one of the toilets, just incase it's pulling hot water!!! There's no reason our bill should be so high!",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"I really enjoyed this hotel! They recently had a refresh and it totally shows. I loved the west elm decor - that is a star partnership. I particularly like the comfortable couch/trundle bed. The suite sizes are very nice compared to some of the other anchorage hotels. Also their was some really great people at customer service. They stored our bags while we went camping in denali and they were able to provide a lake checkout. It was a great stay for me! The one downside is they have not updating the cooling system so the AC was a little loud and not very effective considering the heat. Lastly, the mini fridge was very odd and only stayed cold for 2 hours at a time which is basically not effective.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"About the only thing this place has going for it is Guy Fieri visited it once. Where do I even start?

We've been here 3 times and each time it's been awful. Super loud and crowded. The service is ok.

The food is downright bad. We got lunch our first time. My kids food was cold like they put it on a plate and stuck it to the side for 10 minutes to make ours. The burger we got was dry and we didn't get through half of it and we shared the meal.

Month's go by and we try it again. Breakfast this time. Once again my poor 3 year old was given the coldest food possible. It came out in a record 4 minutes. Her waffle was cold wet and soggy, telling me they made it awhile ago and probably had a bunch in a tray. Her eggs were rubbery too and soggy like they sat in a tray. Ours wasn't much better

Time 3 was better service wise but food was the same. I'm definitely not going back which is sad because this place has potential",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"They are snobs, they never call back plus the unwillingness to help. I have purchased  mittens,  and other things. The product is ok but way better price and way better customer service other places like Big rays. Better product for the price. Apocalypse  is unhelpful at all aspects, i have asked for help over the phone and left full message as well as number on 3 different  occasions over the the last 12 years and nothing but crickets. Buy Canadian goods as they are way better suited for the arctic and for mushing  the kenai area has way better products.

They do a great job with their K-Bay roasted coffee and it often includes latte art, which is a nice touch. Sports gear is available for check out near the counter for those who are heading upstairs to The Rooftop. They have a changing installation of local art, photography, and things of that nature. Unfortunately, it's often chilly here in winter due to the position of their doors.  Seating isn't comfy or cooshy, just hard chairs and benches. This isn't a problem, but is definitely worth knowing if you were thinking about coming to settle in for a bit with a laptop or whatever.",Taste,Experience,,

"About the only thing this place has going for it is Guy Fieri visited it once. Where do I even start?

We've been here 3 times and each time it's been awful. Super loud and crowded. The service is ok.

The food is downright bad. We got lunch our first time. My kids food was cold like they put it on a plate and stuck it to the side for 10 minutes to make ours. The burger we got was dry and we didn't get through half of it and we shared the meal.

Month's go by and we try it again. Breakfast this time. Once again my poor 3 year old was given the coldest food possible. It came out in a record 4 minutes. Her waffle was cold wet and soggy, telling me they made it awhile ago and probably had a bunch in a tray. Her eggs were rubbery too and soggy like they sat in a tray. Ours wasn't much better

My first time here was to see the Star Wars: Rogue One with a group and it was extremely fun.  I would definitely suggest getting here early for very popular movies like this one as parking can be tricky and there are a lot of places near that will results in getting you towed if your not paying attention.  The food and drinks were of course excellent.  This was my first time seeing Rogue One and I was concerned that this type of dinner and movie type of experience would detract from that however the screen/3D quality was good and it's hard to complain when being able to drink your favorite ale while seeing a move on the big screen. :)  Is it on the more expensive side?  I'd say it is however to get Moose's Tooth food/drinks while watching a movie makes for an extra special experience.,Quality,Price,,

"I will never order anything from them ever again. I received food that was burnt, something that resembled meat, and after calling and emailing them I have yet to be able to speak to a manager. Sometimes things happen, I get it. Providing great Customer service is how you make things right when they do go wrong and not acknowledging customer's complaints only makes things worst.

"To start this Im only giving you 1 star because its the only way to review. I went there today and went to drive-thru and everything went well until we had to wait in pull up for food. Everything came out to us pretty fast except for the bbq sauce I ordered I got out of my car and went in to get it so that not to bad except if I had wanted to walk in I wouldnt have went thru drivethru. We got foid checked bags and all food there so drove home, which is all the way past OMally because I wont go to Dimond McDonalds because food and order us always messed up, always go to Huffman. Well I got 3 grandchildren home with food- started eating and 2 of our cheeseburgers had no meat on them...2 cheesebuger really. So got children and myself back in car and drive all way back to McDonalds to tell them about this problem and the Manager acted like this wasn't even a problem. He said he was sorry and made us 2 new cheeseburgers and then walked away. I cant belive he didnt even give me my money back for those 2 cheeseburgers for our in convienence. I will be calling his boss and will do the survey on my reciept. Im really shocked he didnt give grandchildren a ice cream cone or a pie. I dont think we will be going back there again.",Taste,Customer Service,,

And to extend our trial further we even ordered an order  Mongolian Beef,  house fries, and regular fries for everyone to sample  OMG!!  We all agreed that everything we purchased was the best we had ever had!  We are sorry that we have waited so long to give this place a try.  It is for sure our new favorite for burgers, fries, and Chinese food.   Someone said in one of the reviews that they dream about the House Fries.....I have no doubt I will be too!

I had the spicy veggie burger  (qauliflower and quinoa)  that was the second best veggie burger I ever had. The reason for the 4 instead of five star, I ordered a gluten free bun and they had run out. They open @ 5, I ordered by 6:20 you can't run out of that so quick.

"Awesome RV park on the spit, about 3 and 1/2 miles out.   Now, its a bit more pricey than other places on the spit, but the reason is you get what you pay for.  They have a private beach that is for the RV park guests.  The shower and restroom facilities are included with the cost, and they're the cleanest facilities of any RV park I've ever ever been to (all across the states).  There are two gas grills so you can cook outside,, and areas to sit out in the open or under their covered area..  Laundry facilities are available, of course, clean and tidy, but for a load to wash and dry is about $5.  They have a cafe and serve coffee and other items.  And of course there's a  gift shop.  Its right next to the fishing hole as well.  The sites themselves ha e water, sewer, and 20/30/50 amp service.  Each site has a fire pit and picnic table.  Its awesome.  You can fish, have a fire, and watch the bald eagles come and hang out.  And the people running and working here are super friendly.  There's also an observation deck on the second floor, just so you can enjoy the views of Kachemak Bay.  From now on when I come to Homer, I'll be staying here.",Location,Customer Service,,

"First off, I have to state that Alaska requires the use of a curve for rating certain things, like the service industry.  By my usual Lower 48 standards, this place may be a 2.5-3 (for the main rooms--not the cabins).  If you know Tok and what it has to offer in this regard, then one may lean a little higher.  They work with you if you have to arrive after hours, are dog-friendly, have a nice little restaurant on site and a bunch of nice folks.  The rooms I've stayed in could use some work, but by Alaska standards, they are still doing pretty good.  And the price is surprisingly better than a lot of places (at least in the winter months).  They have a pretty decent salad bar too.  If you ever spend any time in Alaska, you will know why this is a benchmark of a good place that serves food.
If you're making a stop for the night in this area, I'd make it here.",Quality,Customer Service,,

This place has stunning food. It doesn't get perfect marks because I've been served burnt pizza and really average poutine. It's really difficult to get a reservation and the staff has been rude to me more then once when trying to get a table. They never told me I could sit in the bar area without a reservation and even tried to keep me from doing so. I had to insist that I knew it was possible. I believe I was treated badly because they didn't realize I was a local.,Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"Highly qualified and professional doctors, specialists and staff. I have been a patient here on and off for years  but recently I've been working with Dr. Lorenz since 2015.  I have a relatively complicated situation, and have had experienced a lot of discrimination and negative bedside manner when doctors could not diagnose the problem.  I've only had positive experiences with this organization.  Dr. Lorenz has taken great care to determine the best course of action, if any is necessary, and is great at ensuring that the patient understands the information that is necessary for their health. The only drawback, if you feel the need for one, is that the location is in a medical office area on the north edge of downtown where most people don't travel to very often.  Access to the area is great, and there is plenty of parking on street, adjacent to the building if the parking lot is ever full.   And sometimes you have to wait a month out for an appointment.  If you need a specialist, I'd surely recommend these folks first.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"I have NO doubt this place will be a 5 star establishment soon. The food is over the top delicious, but they are still working out some kinds. I have zero complaints about the attitude of the wait staff, but I do have to drop a star for how they generally don't greet you until you're seated and they kinda notice you are there. There aren't a lot of tables. C'mon. No one even greets you with a ""be right with you"" or anything to let you know you're valued. Once you've gotten a menu and ordered, it is all made from scratch essentially, so I understand it takes a bit... but if we could get that arrival part worked out, things would move just a little faster.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"We moved in as the house we were living in sold and we were in dire straights with a baby in tote. Our first 2 weeks there we were boiling water to bathe the baby as we had hot water. It took them 2 weeks to repair because they flipped a switch and it turned out we needed a whole new water heater. We had a water leak that took 2 months for them to address, we had water leaking thru our kitchen light and cupboards and they came and just put a piece of sheetrock over the hole and plastered it. We spring a leak over the showerhead and were afraid as the sheetrock leaked it would fall on my Grandson while he bathed. Our got water was hooked up to the toilet and raised our electric, our garbage disposal quit working, we had to wash clothes by hand waiting for repairs and then the dryer quit working and the dishwasher was leaky.. we had mold under the sink and the kitchen drawers had no sliders and the fireplace was broken with sharp edges. If we had proper notice of the house selling we would have NEVER made the mistake of paying for substandard living quarters.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"This place was not bad and not great we were in Juneau port for one day and we had a half day excision and since this tram was right by the port we figured we would give it a  a shot.
PROS: close to port, hiking trails we not bad, great views of local landscape and port. Also it is locally run and we would rather pay the locals then give more to the cruise line.

CONS: too expensive for what is offered on t hw top, the eagle was in a small enclousure and we felt bad for him,  it took over 1.5hrs to get down because of a long line and they crammed in so many people on the tram you could barely breath.  Some hiking trails were closed and we were not told until we got to the top.  Food was not great and expensive.",Taste,Price,,

"(Translated by Google) There is no exposure to the view. Had a great luck with the weather. The parking lot was virtually empty and the viewing platform also, because the signs to the viewpoints, or to the exits or parking spaces towards Denali National Park do not exist.

Well it's definitely worth stopping there.

Da ist nicht auszusetzen bei der Aussicht. Hatten selbst ein riesen Glück mit dem Wetter.

"If you're looking for good Italian food with family size portions and on the cheap. Look no further! Guido's is one of those hidden gems that you hear of or shall I say ""you don't hear about"". While the decor and atmosphere leaves you with a sense of a ghost town, the food will more than make up for it. Many times have I ordered from them only to get filled up on their Greek salad and I still had a hot sandwich left untouched.

"The Sand Bar is pretty much a run down heap of a building.  With that said it is one if those places people love to visit because it is ""real"".  People just want to come, eat, drink and have a good time with their friends and buddies.  There are pool tables and Karoke.  The grill serves some of the best fried halibut you will eat.  They also have prime rib, burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Fries are home made.  Prices for most sandwiches are 9-12 dollars.  Halibut is 18 or 21 depending on how big you go.  21 is 1/2 pound or eight 1 oz pieces.  The other is 5 oz.  I come here everytime I visit Juneau.  When they are busy, especially during extended lunch time (11-2:30) or so don't expect to come in for a quick bite.  It is all made fresh and it takes a bit to prepare it.

When we arrived we told the host that we were meeting our friends and they insisted they were not there yet and directed us to the bar, I asked if we could look around and the host insisted our friends hadn’t arrived, eventually letting us look for them. Not sure why they didn’t want us to look around, but our friends had already been seated and served. They had let the host know that they were waiting for two more... we were the two more. Pretty sure the host was judging us based on the color of our skin. We are white, our friends are not. We haven’t been back because of this combined with the flavorless food and mediocre drinks. We laugh about it now, but it was crazy to us at the time.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Best seafood I've ever had. Anchorage offers surprisingly high quality seafood at a very reasonable price (partly because there's no tax) And I'm comparing to cities with strong seafood culture like Boston, Seattle, and Honolulu.
Despite the very good dining experience we've had at this place, I couldn't give it five stars because their steaks are always overcooked and cooked unevenly. You have to ask for one or two levels lower to get the doneness you want (e.g. their 'medium' is actually medium-well or even close to well-done). I really hope they address this issue because it's a waste of the high quality beef they use. Nobody wants dry aged Prime grade steak well-done!",Quality,Price,,

"My wife and I stayed at the Historic Anchorage Hotel and booked their ""Romance"" package. The package was to include a Jr Suite, a bottle champagne, a round trip carriage ride to Orsos restaurant with $60 coupon.

Checking into the Hotel we were given actual keys. We thought it was all part of the historic charm but still thought it odd. When we finally was able to get to our room and my wife had a very difficult time turning the key to open the door. Once we were able to unlock the door I had to shoulder open the door because it was stuck in the frame.
The room was spacious and had a decent view but it was very cold and i was unable to find a thermostat or a heater. Also found that the deadbolt on the door was not working properly and we could not safely secure the door overnight. We went downstairs to report the door and heat issue. To the front desk's credit (I think her name was Jennifer) she immediately changed the room for us and joined us to verify the new room had a functioning deadbolt.

We were disappointed to find the new room was not as nice and had no view out the windows except for the rooftops of the building below. Looking around the room I immediately found a couch cushion was placed incorrectly onto the couch. Fixing the cushion I found a large amount of crumbs and dirt under it. I also found the cushions to be extremely dirty and in need of a good steam cleaning. I did not want to think about the rest of the furniture that needed cleaning. Also found the bathroom door knob was loose and ready to fall out of the door.

Overall, I see a hotel with great historic charm and potential but there is a serious need of maintenance and a good cleaning.

Next time I will stay at the Hilton next door.

FYI... never got the bottle of Champagne, apparently the hotel no longer has a liquor license. I suggest that they quit advertising it.",Taste,Cleanliness,,

"Just bought a car and had a lovely experience. My schedule was kind of time crunched so Jorge and Travis stayed late for me (which, I'm not advertising for them but I appreciate!)

It's always a fear of mine when doing anything with cars because I don't have a ton of car experience.

One not so great thing is my battery died after 6 days (my kids left the trunk light on) and I'm supposed to have some great ""care"" they provide. I got it jumped and wanted to bring it by to get the battery checked to make sure I would be able to leave work. They tried to schedule me while I was at work Or The Next Day. I don't know how regular people function without their car starting but I took mine to O'Reilly's and they checked it for me. (Thanks O'Reilly's (and Autozone), btw, for always being dependable.) Kendall Ford sent me a text saying to let them know if it kept acting up, that they would replace it.. which.. is nice. But I need my car for work and kids and, unfortunately, I'm not in the position for it to be down all willy-nilly. So. Kind of disappointing as far as their after care service goes.",Taste,Customer Service,,
"Outstanding customer service! Their drinks are fabulous! Yes all of their drinks! I have a family of 7 and there is something for everyone!

They are usually about 4 to five cars deep on both sides so get there with enough time tk wait about 5 mins per car ahead of you.

"We arrived at the Alaska Shirt Company in Skagway just a little late for the start of the annual 4th of July Parade, it was a great place to view the parade.  We were a bit let down hoping to see the parade thinking we lost the opportunity.  To our amazement the parade turned around about a 1/4 mile down Broadway and marched right back right in front of us.  It was really fun time bright sunshine, warm temps lots of fun and enjoyment for everyone.  We wandered up and down Broadway and wound up at the Skagway Brewery,  what a surprise.  This was a great place to visit and take in all the sights it has to offer.  Make sure you come  and visit this place when you come, you'll enjoy, we certainly did.",Taste,Experience,,

"Although this place doesn't look like much on the outside, the food is the best Mexican cuisine in Fairbanks because it's actually authentic Mexican, unlike other places that claim to be. It's usually busy, their food is worth waiting for, but it really doesn't take a ridiculously long time to get your food like at other restaurants. If you speak Spanish I'd recommend ordering in Spanish. Although the staff does speak English, it's  second language, so they get pretty happy when someone speaks to them in their native tongue. And give their Horchata a taste, it's delicious.",Taste,Customer Service,,
I didn't get to try the dim sum because I didn't see it on the menu seemed like extremely american food. Spicy beef wasn't spicy it was cooked well w high quality ingredients.

"I usually go to Jiffy lube for an oil change, chassis lube and (including) the 12/24/5 point inspection. Reason I decided to give these guys a try is because Jiffy lube, Mobile 1 etc. doesn't  ever do what they say their going to do. Example: 1) After a chassis lube I look under my truck and notice nothing has been touched. 2) Pull my truck out and the oil plug is leaking oil. 3) Blow all my fuses etc. Although the main reason I wanted to take it to a shop was because I had a break light that was out. I was feeling too lazy to fix myself. I noticed Simard, has some great reviews (not a single bad review, out of over 600??? on their site.). So I decided to give them a call. I ask the guy on the phone to go over their prices and what it included specifically the 15,000 mile 75 point inspection. The price was $150. He stated an oil change was not included ($99), So I asked, 'what am I getting' other than a kid filling out a inspection check list? He stated that  they flush this, they flush that and they rotate the tires...I'm like, oh cool...I am getting something other than paying for them to just fill out a simple checklist.

I take the car in at 8AM, as per requested. They have shuttle service (round trip), that was nice. I get a call at 4:15 notifying me that my ride is at my house ready to take me back to the shop (nice). Arrive at the shop at 4:50, was told my car has not been inspected yet. Waited, waited...cars good to go now. ;-) So they go over the paperwork, tell me all the minor (thankfully) issues my vehicle has. Find out the tires do not get rotated (only upon request), nothing has been flushed, misunderstanding, I'm OK with that and will take it as a misunderstanding on my part. So you are still getting a kid just filling out a checklist for $150.  They did give me a free oil change for the misunderstanding, and even offered a discount in place of the free oil change if I wished...no bother I was already bummed (because I did have high expectations) and felt it is much the same as all the other auto shops around town.  All in all I get a less than 35 (could have been 10 min what do I know, they close at 5:30) minute, 75 point checklist for $150. I will give them the benifit of the doubt.  I am not pleased or overly upset, just a bit exasperated.
As I am driving out of the parking lot I notice my Brake light in the reflection of the shop window, I think oh, ok the brake light is working I look to see if the other brake light is working, can't see it in the reflection. I thought about driving backward to readjust as to see the other brake light's reflection (to see if it had been fixed), I remembered the checklist that we had gone over, there was no mention of a brake light that was out, I assumed that meant they had fixed it as per my request...being that I paid for it to be fixed.  So what we have here is a 75 point checklist turn into a ""less than 75 depending on time...only have 15/30 minutes I'm sure they want to get home, lets hurry and make this a 75/30 ''main'' points checklist!

Although I am not overly displeased (Been there done that), I kinda expect auto shops to be in it for the $$$ and not the Job. Its hart to find good help these days, not much chance finding a kid/worker that is conscientious about his work nor is it possible to find an auto shop willing to take on the responsibility of its (unconscientious) employees. .

Update: I didn't respond or contact them. I just bit my tongue, and decided to eat this one. it was them that reached out, and kept reaching out to me until I responded. They admitted fault right from the start, I kept ignoring them and trying to push them off.  All is good, they made it right. I received a full refund, who does that? I truly believe they really try to be Honest and want to make it right.  I believed there is No way, no how you will ever find an Auto shop accept responsibility...just found one!
Born and raised in Fairbanks, You will not find a better Auto shop than Simard's. They are as good as the rest and Better than the best.

"$5 lunch is a great value.  I ordered it  in the drive through with a blizzard.   They served it first and I had to wait for my lunch.   By the time I got my lunch the blizzard was half melted.

"First lets address some of the negative things others have said: There were no bed bug issues. The restaurant had some very knowledgeable and talented cooks who were willing to work with our special dietary needs. The food is expensive- because it is high quality ingredients. Grass fed beef, free range chicken etc. The shower does not get HOT- but turned all the way to hot it got warm enough for me. My mother did say that in the evening it seemed like the hot water ran out.

I used to travel to Anchorage with my family when I was little and have fond memories of the very same window ledges, carpeting, and loud wallpaper. Which would be fine except that little care seems to have gone into making this retro look appealing. For example- the wallpapered wall had splotches of white paint on it and various things in the bathroom were not fully screwed in. The rooms are basically clean. However deep cleaning is not happening. I saw numerous questionable spots in the bathroom that I scrubbed myself before using. We found the beds to be comfortable and found amusement in the fact that the sliding window over the sink does not open to more storage but rather to the fuse box.

If you are looking for good wifi go somewhere else. While there are times when internet connection is available, more often than not it is extremely slow and even nonexistent. For them to advertise high speed internet was very misleading.

We spent a week here. It was nice to have the fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Whenever we called to ask for more pillows or towels they were brought up so fast! The front desk was always helpful and depending upon who was there, even went above and beyond what we would have hoped for/expected.

However there is an older blonde lady who frequents the front desk. She is so loud that her voice is at yell level on a full time basis and she does not stop talking. When the internet was not functional in our room I used the computer in the lobby. I could hear everything that woman said as she was training a new employee. She badmouthed people and apparently thought she was being quiet because even talked about people around her. She used foul language and did not keep an eye out for guests. I saw on numerous occasions, people waiting to be helped while she chattered away with the trainee. It did not take long for me to decide I preferred peace and ears without pain more than I wanted wifi access.

They have obviously remodeled areas in the hotel. The laundry and workout room are fully re-done and look very nice. The lobby and a tiny section around the elevators has been improved.
However, the carpet in the hallways is not only discolored and dismal, dirty looking- its smelly and not secured. If you struggle with walking at all and would have worries about potential tripping hazards then this would be an issue.

If you are looking for cheap, sometimes friendly service, a comfortable bed and high quality food, have a great sense of humor and don't really need wifi then this is the place for you!",Taste,Customer Service,,

Let me make this more in detail since it wasn't detailed enough. The week of April 13th we went here to get a new vape. There was a HAND written sign on the door stating to go to their other location because this one was closed at the moment not due to renovations. We get to the other location and they were completely out of Vapes! I spoke with the female who stated she was the owner and also stated that she was very sorry to be out of stock of ALL Vapes at this time and she blamed UPS. I feel like that is something a vape shop should not run out of.,Location,Experience,,

I used to love medical park. I've seen some really amazing doctors there and usually am treated very well. Up untill about 2 years ago.

"I took my car in to have it serviced and was told my radiator needed replaced, so I had them fix it, then picked it up the following day. A week later, I was sitting in a parking lot when I heard a “thunk,” my car started smoking, and green fluid started gushing onto the ground. I had to have it towed back to the shop.

So you’re probably wondering “why the positive review?”

After explaining the situation to Butch (the owner), he said he would look at it first thing in the morning. Then he said “did you have to pay for that tow? Because if this is our fault, we will reimburse you for it.” Sure enough, it was, and the next morning he called me and explained what had gone wrong the first time they tried to fix the radiator. He explained that they had corrected the mistake, and that my car was ready to go. 3 things I liked:
1)	He took ownership of the mistake made by his shop
2)	He fixed the mistake (very quickly, and free of charge)
3)	He reimbursed me for having my car towed.

Butch is honest, honorable, and treats people well. I didn't have to argue, yell, beg, or even plead my case to have the error fixed. And even though I would've preferred to avoid all that drama, I now know that they do, in fact, stand behind their work, no matter what. After that experience, I'd recommend Superior to anybody.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"Ever eat a spoon full of salt - you will here!

Don't believe me or know what I mean?  Go to this place and order the spaghetti and meatballs for $15.99 then sit back and get your $15.99 education.  They'll serve you literally .25 cents worth of spaghetti with a pile of sauce made up of 3 tablespoons of salt, a 6 oz can of tomato paste, and 6 ounces of ketchup.  I'll bet my life the cook is a lifetime Camel unfiltered cigarette chain smoker who hasn't been able to taste anything for the past 30 years.  However, I gave it one star because it's not as bad as the absolute most disgusting food I've ever paid for in my life.  That title goes to the Denny's located at 1 Center Dr, North East MD 21901, at a Flying J truck stop.  ALL of the food literally tasted like you were eating pure salt.  From the fried chicken, to meatloaf, to mashed potatoes, to the banana pudding and they don't serve sweet tea!  This place is so disgusting, I've told people to stop by and see how awful it is.  Here in Fairbanks, I just tell everyone to stay away from Denny's and you're better off eating food from the dumpster behind China King.",Taste,Experience,,

Yesterday my grandaughter had a appt with this clinic. I am so disappointed with the shaming that her Doctor and Nurse played on her. She is 13 years old and has a condition that is no fault of her own she has lived with and will continue to live with for the rest of her life. I will be reporting this team( doctor- nurse) who dystroyed her for reasons I dont understand. It seems like they were playing a junior high mean girl game. Again I dont understand why they felt the need to do this but it took away every bit of spirit she had. As her grandmother and her loving advocate I will continue to look for caring- understanding Doctors and medical team to help her. Also I want to say the the ladies at the front desk and nurse that took us back are wonderful. Im sure they get all the bad and complaining people who are having bad days or Doctors who think they can treat children unfairly who dump on them . We were treated wonderful  and respectfully by them. Thank you,Restaurant,,None,

"Hands down the best pizza in Anchorage. For someone who travels a lot and a True New Yorker, This is what pizza is suppose to taste like. This place is 2nd behind NYC with the pizza. The portions is just right it is not thick. Quality and you get a large take out for $9.99. Worth the money and the taste. This is the only place I order my pizza from. To those who haven’t eaten here before you won’t regret it best pizza. I haven’t ate anything else but I can vouch for the pizza 🍕😋😋😋😋",Taste,,None,

But be reasonable and understand that the best time to go is during the week (M-F) after work and NOT during the holiday season or in the first few weeks after a new iPhone comes out.  If you go on Thursday night at 8 pm (as I did tonight) you will probably get served right away. If you go on the Saturday afternoon after a new iPhone comes out, bring something to do because you will likely be waiting for a while.  It’s just common sense.",Quality,Customer Service,,

"The Chips and Salsa which were once a nice treat before a fantastic meal have become the highlight of the dining experience at El Sombrero.  The flavor of the food has suffered and it seems like a lower quality product and not so much poor seasoning.  Actually the French Fries were very good!  Out waitress was only OK. Clearly no real interest in the Service Industry but did manage to handle herself in a 3 star manner to match the food.  ....and the Strawberry Margherita that used to be so yummy is gone,  replaced with a version that doesn't come close to what we were all used to. It was average at best.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Definitely the best quality & value for Mexican food that I've had since moving here. You can get a nice tamale and taco combo (with rice and beans) for like $7. The burrito is a little more expensive, but you won't be paying over $10 like you would at Taco King. You can also buy ingredients and tortillas here as it is a factory that makes their own products.

The only downside is that the deli is only open for lunch, otherwise I'd go back more often.",Quality,Price,,
"The cons are minimal, limited parking and indoor seating but the pros far outweigh. The beer is really good, great styles represented. I think for Belgian style brews this is a great place. I tasted the Saison and Dubbel, both delicious. The saison is a little more clear than I'm use to. It's more common to show some haze but the aromas and flavor are great. The prices here are perfect and the best part for the true beer enthusiast is the glassware. These guys obviously take pride in their beer and respect the styles because I didn't see a single shaker pint in the place. The shiny fermentors are on display inside. No food in-house but there was a food truck outside. To be honest the food truck was in the way of the brewery itself, I would consider moving them a little so anyone looking for the brewery can see it otherwise it may be easy to miss. Great place you don't want to miss!",Taste,Price,,

"4.5/5

What a great find! It's on the corner of Badger and Old Richardson in a little house/shack type thing. The guy (I wish I knew his name!) that runs it is super nice and the food is really good. Basically every entree is $10 even and some smaller things are less. We usually park and walk up but I've seen people drive up to the window as well.

My only complaint is that the eggs are usually burned in the Pad Thai and the spices are insanely spicy!! Maybe I should get a clue from the name but be very slow about adding the spices to your dish! He'll put some spices in the take out container for you to use... They're super spicy.

"If you're looking for low prices then Walmart is your next stop.  I found vacuum cleaner bags at Walmart while Fred Meyers has none.  The store is easy to navigate, but the checkout section is confusing because the registers aren't in a line.  I think the staggered registers make it difficult to see and move to an open register.  The employees are polite and helpful, but remember to keep your receipt handy because you'll be asked for it before you leave the store.

"My Husband and I are newly weds. We decided to take their tour while on our Honeymoon and I'll tell you what??

Went on a tour with Stan Stevens in Valdez, AK.
If you want to WASTE your VERY HARD earned money, go on with this tour company but, if you don't want to just waste your money, invest on something different, by all means. This tour company sucks and the capitain is BEYOND HORRIBLE. Won't even get close to wild life animals ON SHORE for you to get a good photo. (Not possible to get a photo even with a professional camera). Save your money and go to the hatchery. There, you'll see the sea lions up close, they'll be feeding, you'll see seals up close, you'll be able to see sea otters, etc.
The serving crew was really good but the captain of the boat was the problem. Asked the passengers for help finding whales because he obviously didn't know what in the heck he was doing and when it was time to see some sea lions at ""their island"", he wouldn't even get close to them. Today is 7/7/2019 and believe me, MOST passengers were asleep on the boat because there was NOTHING else to do. No entertainment at all.
The ONLY excellent thing about this tour was the fact my Husband and I were together. That was FANTASTIC and I can't complain.",Quality,Experience,,

"UPDATE 2/19/2019.

So there has been a change in management. Took down our 5 star rating. Not many people in the resturant, service initially attentive. They gave some updates to the decor, but took down the cool plants that the kids liked to look at. We represented a table of 5, with 2 kiddos. Sushi was okay, but there seemed to be a decrease in qyality. Menu same but not the same as before. The King Crab(Kani) was dry for the 3 orders. No follow up on the meal served. Check was delivered to the kids end of the table while adults in discussion, so we sat awhile waiting. We will try it again.

PAST review:

5 star.  Long time favorite of my wife's family growing up. Tempura Kitchen though was their number one. Feel that this is perhaps the closest legit Sushi in town. Lot's of psuedo Japanese joints,  but they have maintauned a more traditional approach. Just not a sushi place though, lots of other Japanese cuisine. You don't go for a fancy  decor or hipster mixologist, you go for deliciousness!",Taste,Customer Service,,

"As a travel agent: It is best to fly the airline and get direct information via e-mail and updates. They have special programs for residents and the points can be accumulated on their air points of credit card. You have to use the points within a year because they will expire.
They co-share with other airlines. For me it was good to use my Delta # and gather my points.
They fly into Canada and USA but use their partners if you are from another destination. The staff on board were helpful and enjoyed chatting to the impatient passengers. They sold small ipads for movies and food in the cabins. We were asked who preferred veg. or not. I tried the fruit platter with cheese.

"As a travel agent: This is one of the most popular hotels in Anchorage. It gets very crowded & the staff is polite but seem overworked.
This is where large groups tend to stay for the free wifi, Alaskan flare in the lobby and terrific if not the best WIFI in town.
There are many room types including one with 3 bathrooms. Each room has black out drapes since the sun shines most of the summery days. If you need anything there are plenty of shops inside to get your Alaskan souvenirs, or forget your bathing suit and toothbrush. They have art work to tell the history. The view is outrageous and you can watch seaplanes take off!

"This place has a little bit of everything!

Salad bar, food entrees, and live crab are only a few items that bring me back to New Sagaya.  If you're looking for something from the sea then you need to have a look here.  I think the Midtown location is much better than the Downtown location, so check here first.

If you're looking for lunch then get here early or late.  The lines are insanely long and you'll spend 15 minutes waiting.  Bring a friend and hold them hold a table for you outside while waiting in line.

"If you're looking for a tuxedo to rent, inexpensive quality clothing, or a suit tailored then you need to visit Men's Wearhouse.

I've been a customer of the Men's Wearhouse for many years. They have the blue jeans I enjoy wearing. They also have incredible employees. I highly recommend visiting during the week instead of the weekends.

I had a tuxedo fitting with my friends and father last month and the experience was very easy and quick.  I highly suggest this location for your Tuxedo fittings.

Only reason for the second star is because we like the location. We used to stay here all the time when we lived in Alaska and it was awesome. Now this is the most dishonest hotel I've been to in a long time. Supposed to get a essential employee discount but was told I'm not a medical worker so I'm not essential. Even with proof there own governors mandate still nothing. Rude front desk and manager on the phone while making the reservation and when checking in more like we were a nuisance than a paying customer. Pool and everything is closed even though the state is supposed to be open. I know COVID-19 has everyone all jacked up but this is ridiculous. Don't recommend and will not stay here ever again!!,Location,Experience,,

"2020:3 star: PIzza is not the worst in town ,but definitely not convinced me it is worthy of the frothing mob that praises the tooth as the end all be all. Wife got me a philly from here and sadly I have to say it was the worst Philly cheesesteak I have ever had. Seemed to be made with the ""cheese"" that is put on convenience store nachos. Extremely offputting. I would still avoid eating in, COVID or not. Takeout or bust for me.

2013: 4 star: I never have or will dine in, it's a frivolous idea to go there to eat. I always call-in an order, always pizza. Some pizzas are better than others, I won't say theirs is the best either, but it's good. The growlers are nice to reuse, and the staff is generally good about their job and speed at which they can do, I have had some issues but they are few and far between",Quality,Customer Service,,

"After many issues with the office, appointment day arrives & I recieve, yet another call, about an issue that they got confused on. I go, but, decided to take witness in with me because I knew I'd need one. Sure enough, the ""Dr."" Adam Ellison, comes in, just starts picking up injured arm & pulling it up, without asking me, while telling me what my problem was, without even looking at MRI, I ask him not to do that to my arm (massive pain-work injury)he got very huffy, walks out of room. Few minutes later  I/We hear him outside the room : We're gonna do an injection on this shoulder. Get it ready. The MRI ever download, yet?"" & walks in, & proceeds to be, one of the  rudest, arrogant Dr's I've met.
When asked why he said that before even seeing a picture ""I dont have to! I read this little bit in your report. Injections haven't worked previously, pills didnt either, so we're giving you an injection."" What?! That makes NO sense. No you're not, you havent opened MRI yet."" ""What?! *smacks mouse down to move cursor, waves cursor over 2 (2!) pictures of hundreds, ""I cant even really see anything with these pictures, so, theres no injury & you dont want me examining you (noooo, I didnt want him moving my arm w/o telling me, etc.). As I remind him he was doing this w/o even LOOK AT THE PICTURES, he began shouting over me (in front of witness & the obedient nurse), goes to grab my arm THEN DROPS IT ROUGHLY so it fell, & was just..arrogant, jerk that will still bill my WC insurance though. That's ok, I already complained to them about his services & was ok'd the change of provider due to it. Also? This guy said, several times, there was no injury to my arm & even if there was, it wasnt that bad. Really?! 2 Other Dr.s have seen & pointed out, cracks in bone & tears of muscles, yet, you are SO smart, you dont even need to be thorough, you just dictate. I only went because I thought I had no choice & was stuck within an, incredibly, inept system. The folks that saw issues  are not ORTHO so they couldn't help me, beyond pointing out what should/shouldn't be there,, etc. You cant just pad Bill's then call yourself a Dr. I told him ""No, I will not be waiting for her to prep my shot. You're not even listening to me! I'm getting another opinion."" Guy replies, WHILE WALKING OUT OF ROOM,""Ok, Whatever. Bye, have a good day."" I'm glad I brought that witness.

"My wife and I stayed in an RV on the campground; I went on for a day of halibut fishing on one of their three boats. We enjoyed our time with both of these. The campground was very clean. Good access to restrooms, level sites, and a nice laundry facility. Not the best view of the water, but its a short walk down to the beach and you get all the amenities that you wouldn't get at the state campground on the water.

The charter boat was excellent. I had Seth as the Captain and Flynn as the deckhand. Both were super professional and helpful out on the boat. The majority of my fishing has been done in the Bay Area and with the smaller boat you were able to get more personalized attention, which I thought was nice. They were great about coaching me along on some techniques and I was able to reel in two nice sized halibut.

Overall I'd recommend Afishhunt to both stay at and charter fish from. They provide a professional service that is an enjoyable experience. And what I personally enjoyed about staying in Ninilchik over Homer was that it seems like you have a little bit more of an authentic Alaskan experience. Homer seemed a little ""touristy"" whereas Ninilchik was just this nice little village. I'd also recommend hitting up the coffee shop across the street when you get up in the morning.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"I had to come into Anchorage and cannot drive at night. It was my first foray in about six months and I came with the knowledge that there would be requirements for covid. I decided to stay at the Captain Cook because of its location and because it advertised a pool. When I get there, it's $140 for a small room with no pool. I probably could have gone somewhere else but I didn't want to have to try and find something.

I get to the room and the cleaning staff must have forgotten their gear when they left because there was cleaning supplies, restocking supplies,and a case of bottled water. For $140 a night, I would ""expect"" a little better. Room was ok; it served its purpose of somewhere to sleep so I didn't have to drive home in the dark but definitely NOT worth it.",Outdoor,Customer Service,,

"It seems like it's a nice spot to eat. Unfortunately there were a few things that made it kind of something you won't go back again for. The menu is huge and overwhelming. The staff was great but we really felt bad having to ask for more time to look through the menu, and both my partner and I finally just panicked and picked the one thing that stuck out to us that was familiar. We got the pad thai. It was alright. I was kind of disappointed that it seemed wet or soggy. The bean sprouts were wilted in with the dish. It came with a quarter slice of lime which isn't really enough. The chicken had a weird off taste to it...it might have been on the edge of off. It would have been great if the sprouts, lime wedge, and maybe some cilantro had been served on the side so you could mix them in and get that really nice fresh cool crunch with the noodles. It seemed a bit greasy too. We got the cucumber salad and it was like eating butter bread pickles and not at all what we expected. Extremely, overwhelmingly sweet. Not something we're used to at a Thai style restaurant. Unfortunately nothing really noteworthy. Just kind of bland and a bit off.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"I cannot describe how frustrated I am with this business. I took a ring to get sized from a size 7 to a size 6. Simple enough right....NOT!

I took my ring in on November 2nd, I was told it would be ready in 7 days. ""GREAT!"" I thought.

One week later on November 9th I was in the mall picking something else up so I decided to stop in to see if it was ready.  The Gentleman at the counter took my ticket and spent 7 minutes looking for my order.  That by itself is kind of nerve-racking.  He finally found it and came back and said. The ring material is actually platinum not silver so instead of being $45 it would be $95. So therefore the ring was not ready yet. OK money was not the problem. He then began to tell us that the stones were actually CZ not diamonds like we had paid  for when we bought the ring. *Note: we did not purchase the ring from them.* Since we had paid for diamond and not CZ we told him we would just return the ring to where we got it and just order something different.  He said not a problem we would be refunded the $45 we paid to have it sized. He said the ring was at their Eagle River shop and it would be back sometime during the week and they would call when they got it in.

The next week no phone call....

November 26 with still no phone call, we decided to call. No one answered the phone until 2pm. The gentleman who answered the phone couldn't find our ticket once again.  He said he would call me back within 15 minutes.

2 hours later....I get a call. He has my ring but says I don't know if it's done yet.....WTF??? Are you kidding me???? I explain to him nothing was suppose to be done to it. I said I would be there after work to pick it up.

We get to the store and the gentleman at the counter brings me my ring....

IT HAD BEEN SIZED!!!!

There are gashes all over this ring and burn marks. I told the man at the counter they weren't suppose to size it. And he smugly replies it says on your ticket that it needs to be sized. I went over again what was suppose to happen again with him. He replies, ""Oh, well they were probably already working on it when you came in to ask for it back."" we tell him we didn't want it sized because we were told there were CZ stones not diamonds. He said "" oh, they are absolutely real diamonds"" WHICH IS IT????

When I got home with the ring that night I realized a diamond or CZ whichever, was missing. I have been trying to call them ever since but no one answers and their voice mail is full.

This is a piss poor excuse for a business. Now I am stuck with a ring that has a stone missing, with gashes and burn marks, that might be real or it might be fake.  These folks are not jewelers!",Taste,Experience,,

"Keep in mind, this is a busy holiday weekend post Covid lockdown so may not be the usual experience. Seafood shower was not edible. I was starving so I really tried to like it but couldn’t. It was very lemony and not creamy at all. It had a lot of salmon chunks but no other types of seafood that I could taste and no potato or other veggies for a texture contrast. It wasn’t creamy either. The cod sandwich was good but fries were cold. Husband ordered the bacon cheese burger and it had bacon bits on it. Not strips of bacon like a normal bacon cheeseburger. It also took a while to get the food which you pickup from a counter. Also, my soup didn’t come out first like is standard at most restaurants. Ambiance is nice, right by the harbor.

"The Bear Tooth has always been a go to place for us. The menu includes all of your favorite pizza combinations from their sister restaurant, The Moose’s Tooth, and a whole bunch more. Their nachos are delicious but bring an army to help you eat them! They have everything from salads, to wraps, to burritos. I don’t often indulge in soft drinks but it is hard not to order their home brew root beer or cream soda. The service is excellent and quick but, even though they are busy, I have never felt rushed there. While dine in is currently closed, they’ve had quite the take out set up in response to Covid.

"I went in there on a really hard day in between appointments, lots of stress. I was greeted by a calm, clean, comfortable waiting area and immediately acknowledged and offered cold bottled water and coffee. I was quick to be helped and the process for getting an estimate was painless. The lady at the front desk was cheerful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The man who came out to help me was just as wonderful, knew immediately how to help me, and had the patience to explain to me what they could do and what the process would entail

But that's not all. He had my car fixed ON THE SPOT. He knew what I wanted was a quick fix (I didn't know that) and even asked permission to touch my car before demonstrating for me. Within 10 minutes of talking to him, he rolled out my car ready to go. The door was fixed.

This blows my mind. I won't get into the details of cost but let me just say that it was MORE than fair. I am so overwhelmed by the kindness. The lady even offered me a water for the road. These guys have no idea... they just undid a month of stress and loss of faith. My heart is singing and I can't do enough to praise them right now. This was not a case of just excellent service. This was humanity at its best. My endless gratitude to all of your at Fairbanks Collision. Thank you.",Quality,Customer Service,,

"BEST okonomiyaki I have tasted since my cousin (who learned to cook it in Japan) made it for me!! I always order this dish when I see it on a menu, and Oishi Bakery does a fabulous job. It’s got so many components: sweetness from the sauce, saltiness from the bonito & bacon, nice veggie notes from the cabbage, some savory richness from the egg, and a little pickled ginger to cut through it all, and they balance all those tastes perfectly.
We also tried two types of onigiri (especially loved the miso pork belly!) and the cheesecake soufflé, which is a slice of heaven. Imagine sitting on a cloud while wearing a big fuzzy robe and listening to a beautiful sonata and eating a cross between cheesecake and angel food cake with subtle hints of almond; that’s what eating this dessert is like.
I already can’t wait to order from Oishi Bakery again. The one challenge is that I want to try everything on the menu I haven’t sampled yet, but everything I’ve tasted was so good I’ll want to get it again!",Taste,Customer Service,,

"I absolutely enjoyed the view of Seward harbor only thing I liked about hotel!!! Overpriced for view and overpriced considering Covid outbreak in Seward now!!! For a outbreak I sure didn't see any safety precautions for hotel patrons that my husband w read to me before we came from website, that there was sanitizer in room which there was none!!! Therewas to besome spread out in hotel which Isaw none, doorknobs were to have something on this g on them to ensure sanitization,  didnt see that. That guests were not be in a room within 72 hours of somebody else being out. There hotel was packed , I guess patrons safety doesn't mean anything it's all about making the money!!! I didn't see anybody going around cleaning the inside hallway  and outside hallway door handles or railings the whole time I was there, if they are to be sanitized for covid, that is not keeping anybody safe.They are to not be using luggage carts per CDC guidelines for hotels, saw everybody using them, and were they being cleaned before and after each use after people don't  know.? I saw no enforcement of only one person in electrical every time I went by more than 1 person was getting in..Right now I just don't feel safe from coronavirus staying in a hotel after this. Makes me not want to stay again in this hotel room here again or any other for awhile!!! Also ther has to be a better breakfast alternative at this hotel because of covid than what they have right now. To me this hotel is about making the money and not about the hotel patron's health right now!!w",Price,Cleanliness,,

"The Salmon Bake is a summer staple in Fairbanks. You basically have to go once a year. It is a bit pricey, but it is worthwhile for the food and ambience. Pick a warmer day while the sun is out so that you can truly enjoy your time there. The salmon is excellent and the beer battered cod is amazing. We tell our kids that it is chicken nuggets. They believe us and gobble them up! They do have a cheaper hot dog option for kids too if you'd rather. The sides and prime rib are good too. The dessert shack is the best. You can sip some North Pole coffee and enjoy one of two desserts. If you pace yourself, you can really leave fully stuffed and satisfied. And then walk it off over at Pioneer Park when you are done. If you are visiting Fairbanks, this should be your first dinner out. And, in my opinion, skip the crab add on. It's not worth the price.",Taste,Price,,

Criss cut fries as always are delicious, a must have for any Carl's jr. Visit and, if meat isn't your thing they've also got the beyond meat burger! I cant think of another fast food place in Alaska that provides such an option. The line took kind of long to get thru, but it was friday night so I would put more weight into that being the reason, when we got to the window they had all of our food ready to go. It'd be kind of nice if they had a portable payment so they could send someone out to the cars in line, to pay, and then take the food to them as soon as it's done.",Taste,Convenience,,

"I brought in my old bike for much needed repairs and ended up talking myself into a new Trek bike, which I absolutely love! I like that the friendly and knowledgeable staff were totally willing to fix up my crusty old bike and didn’t pressure me into the purchase of a new one. I was able to put my new bike on layaway and make payments! Also, even though I have put on a few extra (dozen) pounds since my last pregnancy and no longer look like as fit as I used to be, I was never treated any differently than the triathlete next to me. Bike lovers come in all shapes and sizes and the folks at Backcountry Bike and Ski will make sure your ride is tailored to your specific needs and skill level.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Pretty dissappointed with renewing my membership with costco the last 2 years, last year i had the gold membership, didnt make back the membership amount so they sent me a refund check for 28.75. I went in to ask about it, like how i use it etc, said just give it to the cashier when im checking out, so i used it n later when i went to renew my membership they told me i needed the check and it would pay for my next membership but since i used it on food i had to pay another full membership out of pocket, why didnt they tell me that to begin with? Then this year my membership expired on my anniversary day instead of when i actually renewed it, 2 months after my anniversary date cause thats when i could budget in my bills, so i have a cartfull of stuff n them telling me i need to renew when i thought i still had 2 more months so i did not budget the membership fee n had a lil moment of panic in line n asked if i could do a day pass until i can renew, the guy helping me looked like he was going to then this employee lady comes walking over, he explains n she straight up says no you need to renew today with an attitude n i pretty much bust out in tears from embarassment n just walked away...in my eyes i got ripped off 2 months of membership n then that lady's attitude towards me did it for me (dimond costco, short heavyset black lady with glasses n freckles), im done with yall, going to sams club now, which is really disappointing for me cause normally i love costco.",Taste,Price,,

"I moved to Anchorage a little over 2 years ago in 2016.  I;m from the East coast so a clean, precise haircut for my particular hair style is a necessity.  I tried a few different places that were over my price range for a quality haircut.  I came upon Hair Science and made an appointment.  They told me the haircuts would take about an hour because it's a barber school.  You arrive at the top of the hour and every time the staff greets and welcomes you.  Literally the enter staff acknowledges that you've just arrived like you just showed up to a house party.  It feels good and kind of breaks the ice, so to speak. They all dress very sharp.  Each student has different skill levels which Shawn (Owner and teacher) goes over and after the haircut makes sure he is happy with it and you are.  They are consistent with the quality they bring out and they are always improving.  I remember consecutive appointments I would be assigned to the same person and they got significantly better each time.  It's nice to be a part of a place that cares about it's growth in a sense that the students are working to get better at giving you a fresh haircut.  Everyone's always in a good mood and there's always music in the background and sports on the TV's.  It's more than just a service at Hair Science.  It's an experience.  I look forward to each of my appointments cause I forget everything I'm stressing about in life.  I'm at this place and I'm present.  And in that 1 hour I'm being laughing and chatting with the staff.  There's also a sweet picture of Marvel's Black Panther on the back wall.  Hair Science Forever.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"2.5 stars= For quickly having food prepared, cooked thoroughly and ready to pick up in a little over 10 minutes.

Receipt rang up to $43.25! Quality of food was okay, but DEFINITELY not worth it. The service was quick. The young woman who took my order was polite, but neglected to inform me of how they price the menu items. Which I might add, is not the correct pricing as on the online menu.
Order:
1. RLE Philly cheesesteak (=Subway wrap)
2. Small Fry
3. Bleu cheese burger (=Burger King Whooper w/chz)
4. Large Onion ring
5. 2 Large fountain drinks (=McD's medium drink)

Unfortunately, I had assumed when ordering a sandwich or burger, that it would have a side (fries, chips etc) This was the first time I have had anything from Tommy's, so it's possible that I had high hopes after reading so many good reviews.

Very impressed. I was afraid that I would come in and still feel like I was eating at the old Phillips International but they've done a great job redesigning the interior. The menu has everything from a simple bacon cheese burger to a braised short rib that sounded delicious (unfortunately they were out of that). I had the smoked pork/pineapple pizza that was very good. The kids meatball sliders were the perfect size (two in an order). The chicken tenders looked to be made in-house. They were generous/juicy chicken pieces (light and dark) that were beaded and fried. The braised pork shoulder was again a very generous portion on top of a huge buttermilk biscuit with slaw/sauce/caramelized onion. The staff was extremely attentive and polite. Definitely recommend checking it out,Taste,Customer Service,,

"Went here twice because of its proximity. Both times there is a long line and only one person at the counter. Both times took half an hour just to get to the said counter  and people kept showing up then leaving due to the wait. I don't know if it's understaffed or this is standard operation. As of this writing, 10 minutes till closing, one customer is haggling over priced and getting a walkthrough of different storage units. If there is any kind of management on premises they need to keep an eye on this toward close. Either assign someone to help, or man a counter yourself for a few. This way you don't have a line of people waiting half an hour at an empty counter while the lone salesman does a walking tour for someone.... Who admittedly did not plan on getting a unit today. Better yet have a manager take that over so the salesman can get other customers through.",Customer Service,Price,,

"Like it.
But near by We ordered the garlic knots and two medium pies to share: the XX (pesto, artichoke, red onion, bacon, feta, mozzarella) and the XY (marinara, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mozzarella).
The garlic knots were little bombs of buttery, yeasty goodness, and the garlic was robust but not overpowering. When our pizzas arrived, our expectations continued to be exceeded.
The crust was crisp, flavorful, and chewy. The toppings worked together beautifully. The marinara and pesto were packed with flavor, and the mozarella had a great consistency and very little oil. By the end of the meal we were planning our next visit.",Taste,,None,

"Nice place for a quick lunch, artisan sandwiches are a bit pricey and the amount of seating is limited, but I was told that it is run by students from the local seminary and they of course are friendly and cheerful.  The gift shop portion is quite unique, lots of icons, matryoshka (nested dolls), and local crafts. The dining room walls have recycled art, placemats and rugs made from used boat ropes (lines), and other nautical items.  My sandwich was a good portion of turkey and cheese with a tasty mayo and my daughter-in-law had a veggie burger that’s she described as excellent. Parking is limited and it is best approached from the south but if you have the time it is a far better choice than the McDonald's across the street.",Quality,Customer Service,,

Staff friendly.  Place coincidentally located.  However noisy.  Stayed here as part land component of cruise with HAL. Level 4 overlooking Carparks. Had  some guy using a blower in the multistory Carpark across the road at 11pm at night.  Then woken at 6am from a delivery down stairs.  Could hear every box thrown onto the roller converor along with the conversation around the delivery. Them the buses started a while later (taking people to or from the cruise ships)  While the room was large and clean and spacious it could do with better sound proofing. The places is owned ultimately by carnival cruises who had several billion in profits last year.. updates to the doors and windows of an old hotel would not go astray.,Location,Customer Service,,

"The review for 2 stars is all about the laundry mat.

I give it 2 stars because it's the best I have come across in the area. The prices are terrible. $2.50 to wash, but the machines only hold a small load. I would guess half the size of a standard home washing machine. The ""large"" washers are $7.50 if you are using cold water, $8.00 if you use warm. WORST of all is they don't spin dry your clothes that well!! So you end up spending more in the dryers which are $0.25 cents for 5 minutes!! Again, the prices are way too much.

The place had a bad smell and it was not all that clean. Better than others in the are but that's not saying much.",Location,Price,,

Unfortunately our meal didn't show up for an hour and a half! The staff was not apologetic and then one of the meals was delivered incorrectly.

"I love Love the variety of speciality Asian foods available here. This store basically has it all. There is a salad bar, and even a mini restaurant where you can pick up Chinese takeout type food. They have a nice produce section with specialty items such as fresh shiitake mushrooms. Their dry goods are mostly Asian (rice, varieties of seaweed, sauces, canned goods etc.) but they also have a small section of Hispanic foods (beans, sauces/salsas etc.) and they carry all of my favorite Asian candy/snacks such as Pocky, rice wrapper candies, & these fruity gelatin cups. Their seafood has always been good in my experience. The last time I was there we got fresh tune that had just been flown in from Hawaii! They also have some great frozen foods like pre-made spring rolls. I SO appreciate that they have ice cream flavors not normally found in the US such as ube & buko (It's a Filipino thing.) They also carry things like rice cookers, chopsticks, sushi rolling mats & utensils, soup spoons etc. And in the front of the store is a souvenir type area with dishes, art ect. Some of the items are rather overpriced & I usually buy them elsewhere, but they have items here that cannot be found anywhere else nearby. Overall, it's a great place to shop!",Taste,Price,,

Pretty good one stop shop experience although if you buy a vacuum cleaner and need to return it bring the manual and box and all the packaging with your receipt or they won't take it back. So always remember to keep the manuals.",Quality,Cleanliness,,
"One of the better pizza places in town. Really enjoy the Buffalo Chicken pizza.  Quality of ingredients is noticeable.  Marked down because the pick up wait times are way to long. Doesn't matter if it's a weekend or weekday, it's almost always an hour plus.  Not sure if it's a capacity issue with oven or not enough employees ... but it is annoying.",Quality,Customer Service,,

"If you haven’t had a cinnamon roll from The Bake Shop then you probably haven’t been to Girdwood. It is one of those “must eats” in Alaska. Their soups are delicious as well, especially after a day on the slopes. I love their fresh baked breads...I love just being in there smelling it baking. I can’t speak to all of the sandwich menu because I love the grilled cheese so much I don’t order anything else. Recently I purchased one of their bottomless travel coffee mugs. If you ski often it is an absolute must. Free coffee forever. Considering the quality of their food, the great attitude of their staff and the all around fantastic atmosphere of the place (especially in the garden area during the summer) -  I expect forever is not far fetched.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"If you're looking for an delicious hot meal in Downtown Anchorage then you need to eat at Bangkok Cafe.

In my opinion the soups at Bangkok Cafe will help you get over that flu faster. Not all the food here is spicy, but if you ask for spicy then you'll get nose watering spicy!

The parking is very limited, so I suggest walking here if you're nearby.  There are various sized tables, but no bar.  If you rather take your food to go then you'll have a 15 minute wait. Order ahead to save some time.

The staff is for the most part friendly. The pharmacy here is horrible. Only a drop off and pickup so the line is usually long as well as the speed in which it moves. Check out in this store is a joke as well. No matter the time there is never enough cashiers with no baggers usually so the cashier has to scan and bag. They rearrange the store few months back and now is a cluster to find things. No real flow on the layout. But again the checking out is this stores biggest weakness. They should replace the store manager since they seem to not care about customer service,Location,Customer Service,,

The only reason I'm giving Javier De la Vega Park a 4-star rating, rather than a 5-star rating, is because of the fact that it's so well-hidden from the public's direct line of sight...

"We’ve been residents of Fairbanks for about three months now and have eatin out about 5 or 6 times since arriving, every time we have been disappointed.  The taste just isn’t very good at the places we have tried, for whatever reason.  Couple poor taste with expensive pricing and it makes for a very poor experience.  That was certainly not the case here.  I don’t care about price, I don’t care about seating for large groups, I don’t care about cleanliness, when the food tastes this good, it doesn’t matter.  Do not miss an opportunity to check this place out.  If anyone rates this place anything less than 4 stars they are either crazy or in competition with them.",Taste,Price,,

"There is excellent potential at Millers Landing for a new example to be set in the way of 21st century EcoBusiness that yields millions of dollars in revenue while restoring the Natural state of the land and ecosystem.

""Working Vacations"", Stewardship Projects and being the primary base in Alaska for several upcoming Motion Picture Films about People and Nature.

Multi-millions of dollars have been earned in this small Alaska town by very successful businesses like Millers Landing.

Now, with more and more people of all ages seeking a more meaningful and enjoyable Alaska ADVENTURE rather than a tourism propelled cattle drive, the sudden and extreme drop in tourism can be replaced by a more ecologically and therefore Economically sound business of Education - Stewardship - and Production... putting people to work caring for the Land, Trees and Water, Trails, shoreline, riverbank.  They are can really use some stewardship.

A whole new industry is born that is mutually beneficial instead of mutually assured destruction.

We destroy Nature, She destroys us.  We care for Nature, She cares for us.

Millers Landing is the best place in the world for this to begin.",Quality,Experience,,

Just layer up, bring a blanket to sit on and get some hot cocoa at their concession stand (not always open, so a thermos from home works too). Ice is at a premium in Anchorage and Dempsey Anderson helps meet the need. Very conveniently located in the Spenard/Turnagain area. I’m here watching the Chugiak/Eagle River HS girls hockey team skate against Service/East. It’s always great fun to watch strong young women play! This rink is part of Anchorage’s long hockey history and I’m sure Mr. Anderson would be proud to see that his dedication toward engaging youth in the sport has continued.",Taste,Customer Service,,

A few hours after purchasing, I installed it and noticed a huge Improvement.

"The hike itself is wonderful, amazing views and a fairly easy trail. Should have done a bit more research because I did NOT expect it to be that long, about 13 miles around. HOWEVER, there is a sign dictating the rules before you enter the trail, dogs must be on a leash. If you have a dog that is well behaved enough to not have to be on a leash, that's awesome, but they still need to be on a leash OR be leashed when another group/dog is coming. This was an awesome trail for my little Yorki/Shih Tzu, who enjoys hiking and saying hi to other dogs from a short distance. My dog is a spaz but we'll behaved, but he's also extremely small and cannot handle an unleashed 80 pound dog running straight towards him, which happened with about 6 out of every 10 dogs. He was constantly freaking out and I had to pick him up more than once because the owner of the dog either wasn't there yet, or didn't have full control of their dog. At one point a medium sized dog ran from behind us and started barking at my dog and the owners, a ways behind, did nothing. My dog started retaliating, so I just picked him up when the owners finally said ""yeah you can just pick him up and we'll go around you"". Completely awful experience in that department. If your dog is well behaved enough to not be on a leash, then they are well behaved enough to be on a leash for 60 seconds while we pass by. There is no excuse for that, so please keep your dog leashed moderately and be mindful of other animals.",Outdoor,Convenience,,

"It seems like it's a nice spot to eat. Unfortunately there were a few things that made it kind of something you won't go back again for. The menu is huge and overwhelming. The staff was great but we really felt bad having to ask for more time to look through the menu, and both my partner and I finally just panicked and picked the one thing that stuck out to us that was familiar. We got the pad thai. It was alright. I was kind of disappointed that it seemed wet or soggy. The bean sprouts were wilted in with the dish. It came with a quarter slice of lime which isn't really enough. The chicken had a weird off taste to it...it might have been on the edge of off. It would have been great if the sprouts, lime wedge, and maybe some cilantro had been served on the side so you could mix them in and get that really nice fresh cool crunch with the noodles. It seemed a bit greasy too. We got the cucumber salad and it was like eating butter bread pickles and not at all what we expected. Extremely, overwhelmingly sweet. Not something we're used to at a Thai style restaurant. Unfortunately nothing really noteworthy. Just kind of bland and a bit off.",Taste,Customer Service,,
Dr Ravenswaay was simply amazing! I done the online Dr's visit just needing some refills on my meds. I'm in Anchorage from Ga and ran out. He was so attentive and nice.

"Loved coming here, close to work, good coffee, until I tried to substitute soy and got huge chunks in the bottom of my iced drink. I nicely mentioned it to the cashier the next time (glasses and huge holes in her ears) I didnt ask for a remake and she just told me it's normal with soy milk. Went again and tried the soy milk again but its disgusting having an iced coffee with chunks at the bottom regardless if it's normal for soy to do that, she even argued with me and told me to get my coffee elsewhere. Very poor customer service and quality if you think it's okay to serve chunky drinks. Gross.",Taste,Customer Service,,

Such a fun place to take the family. They care about their community as well and donated to our school's silent auction! Thank you H2Oasis!!!!,Location,Experience,,
"I’ve relied on the excellent group of caregivers at Providence for years to take great care of me and my family. From imaging, emergency room visits, surgeries and extended stays in their state of the art NICU, there is never a time I haven’t been unbelievably grateful to have such an incredible health care center to depend on. They’ve mastered medicine but also compassion, which is sometimes not the case in healthcare facilities. I’ve never had to wait long for any service and my questions are always answered thoroughly and with smiles. Today I needed a scan and was fortunate to have Dylan taking care of me but most every staff member there has made me feel completely comfortable. On a side note, I’ve spent a lot of time in their cafeteria and gift shop, both unexpectedly impressive. The gift shop has a cadre or dedicated volunteers who work there along side the regular employees, which is always wonderful to see. In fact, there are many volunteer opportunities that Providence has created to allow the community to help those who might be in need. They also have a Subway, pharmacy and a couple of coffee shops in the building. When you are there for extended periods, having these services really makes a difference. They maintain a beautiful chapel open to the public and plenty of quiet places for visitors who need a moment to sit and reflect to find on each floor. Providence is proud of their employees, the services they offer and their presence in Alaska, and well they should be.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Exhorbant cost
Save your money...want to say to all people coming to Ak. that get drawn here to this place....

Hidden cost, contracts are changed ,information untrue. This place was an inheritance  and now in hands of grandchildren they did what grandparents did not want...make money off people .   I knew the original owners. Too bad.

Diamond M= be fair. It cost a lot to come to Ak.   to see our state. You do not need to charge so much. Start a new reputation as a gift.

Thankyou for sharing. That is what is lacking. Be a part of a better world. Help the poor. They are thrown around. Help the wealthy. They are used. Change , help share Ak. You charge to much. By your actions you can help the children. Free. You were given, now give more freely.

It's also just a fun place to look around at. You never know what goodies you'll find.",Taste,Experience,,

I used to be a housekeeper, and I can tell a lot of effort went into cleaning, both now and in the past.

The room was quiet as well, it is very much separate from the bar.  The room was cheap, among the cheapest in town.  If you are looking for a small, cheap room, with a warm shower, this place would work great.",Taste,Price,,

"I've visited this place twice in a week. Both times I ordered the same dish: spicy veggie mac and cheese with a side salad. First time I visited, the mac and cheese was outstanding! The cast iron skillet it came in was full to the brim, the breadcrumb topping was perfectly browned, and it was cheesy and flavorful! I was so happy with the dish that I wanted to go back, and I did!  I really wished I had taken pics of both dishes, because it was like night and day! When I placed my order the second time, the the skillet was far from full and the breadcrumb topping barely covered half the dish. Maybe the difference was the first time I went, it was a weekday and the restaurant wasnt that busy, and the second time I went was a weekend, and crazy busy. But consistency is key, so I'm hoping when I go back, I would get the cook that was there during the weekday vs the weekend cook!

The wait staff was amazing and extremely helpful and I do plan on returning. I just was disappointed with my dish because it was so delicious and plentiful the first time. I'm hoping my second visit was a one time occurrence!",Taste,Customer Service,,

Home of the $96 dollar oil changes! Pretty shady of you guys to take down your prices that you used to have posted on the wall. This is exactly why businesses go under. Wasilla is a small town so it won't take long for folks to notice the change. I had my cars serviced here for 2.5 years since I moved up here with outstanding service and price. Today I took in my van in for an oil change. Not only did I  have to wait for 4 hours to get it done (mind you it wasn't as busy as it normally is either) you guys decide to charge me $40 extra for the same oil change I have been getting for 2.5 years. Guess this was the first and last time you guys get to do that and that's how you loose customers. Guess the dealership it is from now on.,Customer Service,Price,,

"We had been here before on the bar side.
This time we went to the restaurant side. It was evening and they had a special of Prime rib for two for $49.95.
Was supposed to be 12oz cuts.
We ordered them medium.
Came with asparagus, soup or salad and a side.
I got the soup which was absolutely delicious.
My husband had salad. While we were happy to know the greens were washed, they weren't drained properly so there was a pool of water and dressing at the bottom.
The asparagus was fresh but overcooked, droopy and waterlogged.
Now for the prime rib. It was well done, not even close to medium. There was no pink to be seen. We picked through it trying to find a pink piece. I've never had prime rib with the texture of ham steak, then again, I've never had prime rib cooked beyond medium.
The server didn't come back until with the check.
I told her the mashed potatoes and soup were great. Then showed her the prime rib and told her about the asparagus and salad, quietly of course.
She said that's what usually happens with that small of a cut and I told her last time we ordered the same and it was perfect.
Then she said they were short staffed which is ridiculous because it's peak tourist/fishing season.
She said she was our cashier also in a bid for sympathy. Didn't adjust the check so we cut up the meat for our dog and he ate it. (Which at least tells me they didn't microwave it)
I paid the check, left the normal 20% tip.
She was very nice aboit it and pleasant at first.
In summary: First time was awesome, second was a waste of money.
They are a pretty popular spot with locals so go and be the judge yourself.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Taylored Restoration will give you an estimate and draw up an agreement only to Come back not only once, but twice after the project has started to make it “cheaper”. Less expensive flooring in the situation I’m referring to, not only once but after the project was started came back a second time with an even cheaper option.

Taylored will ONLY out one coat of paint on your walls

Taylored will NOT do any matching for transition strips from vinyl flooring to next

Taylored WILL leave cabinets unfixed to walls an unleveled

Taylored says they will send a final cleaner, however none of the ceiling fans in house were cleaned, cobwebs in the corners of ceiling from dust collecting, not a single window cleaned, adhesives left to the flooring from when they covered them to protect them

Only came in 7 weeks behind schedule & hear nothing but complaining coming from project manager Brian. Throughout the project I was monitoring for out of state friends, Brian (the project manager) treated me like literal garbage, abusive language towards his staff and customers, has a superiority complex, sucks at customer service & could clearly care less above finishing project in a timely and professional manner. A complete jerk!

I hope everyone at Taylored has to deal with a project where someone like Brian is their contact so they can see the level of customer service they are allowing their brand to represent.

Needless to say, if you’re able, save yourself the headache and go with another company.

There was only a single person doing the majority of the installation work. Was expected to do sheet rock, paint, trim, plumbing, electricity.

Essential the house was left abc competed with the bare minimum to finish the project.

Kitchen sink was left not completely hooked up and has a leak.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

Not exactly what I had in mind, and I'm simply not in to that ""community table"" thing, so it was a turnoff for me.

There was a few grill marks in it, other than that it just looked like a cardboard colored piece of meat. Taste? Meh it was okay, I at least think it was fresh. I'm not even sure there was salt on it. I really wanted to put steak sauce on it.  It came with a little puddle of mashed potatoes and 3 asparagus. Sorry no photo.",Taste,,None,

I showed him a part that i needed fixed he said it was a cheap Chinese piece of crap and it was ruined. He followed that with go home brush up on my Chinese and get a new one off the internet. I asked if happened too have one that was compatible sitting around that might work, he looked around his Sanford and son's parking lot and said yes, but I am not going to look for it go home. He was a real ass to say the least had no people skills and apparently very little to no small engine repair knowledge also. found the part at anchorage small engine repair and had it fixed in less than 3 minutes when i got home.

"After having some pretty disappointing food on our trip to Fairbanks (no disrespect, Fairbanks, but I hope we just didn't find the good options), we came here for dinner on our last full day.  It was simple, but kind of perfect.  It wasn't just the contrast that made it stand out, either.  I started wondering how I could start a place like this back home, which I will admit to doing a couple times in the past, but it isn't a regular occurrence.
Honestly, we were cautious in Fairbanks.  We wear our masks everywhere, not because we are worried for ourselves, but because it is the socially accepted right thing to do right now.  We walked into several places and felt unwelcome, mostly related to this.  We felt more welcomed here than anywhere else we went, and that meant a lot.  The food was excellent, as well.  As I said, it is simple, but it is done right.  The ingredients are fresh and balanced, and so is the menu.  The options range from vegetarian and healthier to more indulgent.  It was not a difficult decision to go back the next day before our flight home for lunch, and we won't make another trip to Fairbanks without stopping here.",Quality,Variety,,

"We pulled in here after driving up from Homer and being in the car for 8 hours. We had such an unwelcome welcome we almost got back in the car to go back to Homer. The owner who we had been talking to on the phone was the nicest man and we were so looking forward to our experience in Denali. What we experienced on arrival was not what we experienced during the booking. We were under the impression that we would be able to book our excursions with the front desk staff but then we were told no and that maybe they could help at the park. We were told the closest place for food other than the food trucks was back a few miles or into Heely where was a Brewery or grocery store. Unfortunately or stay never got better. Our key didn’t work multiple times and somehow this was our fault.

We ended up figuring things out for ourselves and had a great trip but with no help from Grizzly Bear. I hate to even leave a bad review but we saved and spent a lot of money for this trip and the staff here at Grizzy Bear really made this a very bad experience, I expected more. I expected better.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Walked in to find out information.  The one sales associate who was there was sitting on top of the counter top playing with his phone. He looked up to say hi but didn't get up to ask us what we needed.  Walked over to him and asked him if he worked there since he seemed so relaxed.  I also wasn't sure since he wasn't wearing anything that said Cricket. No name tag, shirt, nothing.  He said it's always relaxed at that location and that's how things are there.  On the plus side he did seem to know his information regarding the questions we asked even though he was continually playing with his phone while he was answering our questions.

My wife was so turned off from this type of service that after we left we figured we would forget Cricket altogether.  Just to give them one more chance we went to another Cricket location, and it was a totally different experience.  Was told by this other Cricket employee that they hear complaints similar to ours about this Muldoon location, and that the Muldoon location and the Wasilla location have different owners so it could be that the types of standards are different.",Location,Customer Service,,

"We spent 3 wonderful days at this resort, the hot springs were crystal clear and toasty warm to hot depending where you soaked at. Just a heads up don’t forget to drink as much water as you can, the hot water dehydrates you very quickly! Bring your water bottle, you can refill it in the building where you checked in. There is a lot to do if you want or just relax and unwind. To cool off visit the Ice museum on the property a cool 26f. And very beautiful and unique. This resort is off the grid only Verizon and ATT cell coverage works here what I have been told. We were very blessed to meet the owner Berni sp? And his family. Unfortunately he lost his wife in January and they were having a celebration of life for his wife. What a wonderful man he is and his family.  Sending prayers to his family.  The resort is a work in progress, and progress takes work what he said.  The new hotel covered entry way and drive way was getting paved when we were there in mid Aug . The hotel rooms are nice like camp rooms, don’t expect 5 stars here maybe 3. The restaurant has amazing tasting food, 40 % of the food is grown in the green house and garden.  Ooh, bring shoes that you don’t mind getting a little dirty, paved and in paved areas if you walk around a bit. And hiking shoes if you want to do some hiking.

I walked into steam dot to buy a sandwich and coffee for a hungry elder and was not greeted in fact I was ignored all together when I finally got someones attention I felt they only served me to get us to leave. The whole time I was there the woman working kept looking in our direction with what looked like discussed on her face. It was difficult to get any service at all if the elder gentleman I was with could have walked to a different place so I could buy him food I would not have stayed. A gentleman told me that he would not sell me a gift card for that elder because he does not want to discourage others from coming to his establishment. He claimed the elder had defiled his restroom before and he would not serve him again. He only said that when the gentleman I was with sat down away from ear shot making me mistrust him statements. When other customers entered they were greeted and someone was right there to help them. I feel disrespected and I believe that we were treated unfairly.,Restaurant,Customer Service,,

Upon arrival near the Glacier, we walked for less than 10 minutes where we boarded the canoes. The paddle up River took about 10 minutes then we walked the river Delta for about 10 minutes to the nearest point to the Glacier. The views were amazing....

"Family Friendly attractions and Eagle eyed lifeguards may protect your kids from drowning, but they might still get tetanus..The whole place is a Fantasical rust bucket. Also many attractions haven't worked for years such as the enclosed body slide and the waves in the tidal pool. Your probably only going to want to come here for either the MASTER blaster the lazy river or the giant orange slide;this thing is extremely dangerous by the way. I once actually fell more than 40 feet  off of it while standing up inside it. Once again, fun location,needs safety and attraction repairs.",Location,Customer Service,,

And the I think my favorite part is that my takeout order waste is compostable ☺️ the gluten free waffles never disappoint. The meze platter is filling, fresh and colorful!

"Not a fan of the new ordering system, and that the bar is essentially pointless now. The grilled cheese was still great, but the bloody mary was weak and not flavorful.

When there's a real bartender again and not just people wandering around looking for numbers let me know. Cheers

"I have NEVER felt more unwelcome anywhere. Our waiter asked me at least 4 times in the first 5 minutes we were there if I was ready to order yet then disappearedafter our food got here, my son had an adult menu and order a burger with fries and a milkshake and he got a small kids meal, and I asked for a to go vox from another server and I got oh I can't do that and walked off (he didn't even let my server know), then it took about 15 minutes to get our servers attention, my son just asked to wait in the car it took so long. It was his Birthday which is why he chose to go there and I had a $50 bill to give our server to bribe him for a good birthday song but when he said he just wanted to go home I felt so bad and almost just walked out. I will not be going back there.",Taste,Customer Service,,
"You pay $30 a head if you want to get to the parking lot overlooking the glacier. You drive yourself thru the gate and along the bumpy gravel road over single lane wood plank bridges for 2 miles to reach the glacier parking lot. The hike up to the ice is your choice but the fee is the same. It's a mile up and back for the self-guided walking tour. Watch your step because you signed away all of your legal rights to sue them if you trip! It's all on you. I think they should install a narrow gague rail line from the visitor's shop to the glacier lot. That would reduce wear & tear on vehicles and on the road and it would be fun and worth more. Its a steep road at points, tho.

Bring a jacket. Its cold by the ice even on a warm day like ours was.",Experience,Travel,,

"Great place. You fly in on float planes over the several on Juneau's glaciers, including the massive Taku glacier. You land on the Taku River. And Taxi to the dock. The flight in alone was worth the ticket. You spend a couple of hours at the lodge. We were there when the weather had been unseasonably hot which presented two issues 1) the heat created several fires in Alaska which covered much of the state in smoke including Juneau,  and 2) the amount of mosquitos on the trail was quite large.  Even with these, the trip was worth it so don't let a little fog deter going.

At the lodge you are treated to a wonderful salmon meal. The grill/smoke it right there when you arrive.",Taste,Travel,,

"My first time experience was super from the second I made the phone call to me carrying my yummy pizza out to my truck. I ordered the Saverio's special with no cheese. First time eating anchovies on a pizza, the store placed the anchovies on the side in a small container and allowed the customer decide how much if any to place on top. They are like a fishy pimento olive. The staff was super great and the order was correct and delicious. Plenty of space to eat inside and parking is no problem. I consider the price extremely fair for what you get. Can't wait to try other items on my next visit. They do some delivery so call them up and find out what the schedule is. They open at 11am so a customer can get in before the lunchtime rush if needed. I called my order in at 11 and it was done by 11:20, I was in and out.

"My windshield took a beating this past winter (Oct 2019-April 2020) which lead to chips & cracks.

"First time customer and I will be a repeat customer. Chan was personable, professional and helpful. Of course, there are going to be upsells, and one should use their own discretion. However, I was impressed with the actual ""full service"" oil change! Say what?! I must say, I have been deprived going to places like Quik Lube and Alyeska Tire. All fluids were checked and filled, tire air pressure was checked and filled to match for all 4 tires, and I had no idea that I had a ""cabin air filter"" (duh!) that I okayed to be replaced because it was filthy!! This shop is located in the Northway Mall parking lot. It is super clean, and organized. I like the window in the waiting room where you can check out the cars being worked on, and see where your car is in the process. It's first come, first serve, so when I called on a Saturday to inquire if I could come in at 4 p.m., I wasn't told; ""Oh no, we are too busy."" as I have been told numerous times at Quik Lube. Instead, I was told; ""Sure, whenever you're ready come on in!"" Of course, the busy season is coming up, so timing is everything. (I have been wanting to get my oil changed since September!) I lucked out yesterday, and it truly made my day. :-) I paid the amount I expected to pay, and I will be back. Thanks Xpress Lube.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

Their newly remodeled space and covid conscious cleanings made me feel right at home.  The streamlined process from check-in to check-out was efficient, professional and friendly.  Dr. Bushad (probably spelling that wrong) or “Chad” as he asked to be called was perhaps the best Doctor of any kind in any medical field I have encountered.  His ability to relate complex medical names and procedures in understandable terms was much appreciated.  Everyone in the office seemed like they really enjoyed being there and helping people.

There was a futon, extremely uncomfortable to sleep on, no new shampoos or soaps left in the room.  No real place for 4 people to sit.  Not happy for the price.  It got cold a couple of nights, they had enough blankets, grateful for that",Location,Price,,

"We tent camped here for 2 nights while exploring Valdez. The center of the campground was in the open and there are treed sites around the edges. Don't expect lower foliage separating the sites. Still this is much nicer than the other RV parking lots in town which seemed wide open.

There is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold.

Wi-Fi didn't reach our site on the back edge of the campground. Overall we were happy with our stay at this campground and would stay there again.",Experience,,None,

"Updated: after not following a public health mandate (and willingly putting people in danger) I have changed my below otherwise old glowing review from 5 stars to 1.
-Won't be back.

""Had both a burger and pie.. It was all delicious. The burger has to be one of the best in Anchorage - didn't like the selection of unlimited toppings for the burger.. More choices wasn't great to make it an easy experience. Portions are large, and the Oreo pie was well received by the ladies at the office I bought it for.

"This train depot dates back to the original colonists' arrivals to the Matanuska Valley during the 1930s. It's a City of Palmer historic landmark. Rarely used anymore for its original purpose, it is now Palmer's community center.

I just attended a middle school graduation for a granddaughter here. Recent upgrades and renovations have taken away from it's historic ambiance, but were much-needed. While I sorta miss that the flooring doesn't creak and moan anymore and the old feel of the depot was sacrificed for sake of modernity and functionality, the graduation went well, in part thanks to the improvements.

The exterior of the depot remains original and is worth a look if you're in Palmer town.",Location,Ambiance,,

I watched the staff take and process 17 drive thru orders before making mine, after I had ordered. I stood there for 20 minutes and then because 2 doordash delivery people came in, they rushed their orders ahead of ours. I never said anything to anyone about it, I stood quietly and waited.. Someone loaded each of our burgers with 10-15 pickle slices. We hadn't asked for any changes or anything to our meals, just regular orders. Luckily they were easy to remove, however, with the recent issue of them serving undercooked chicken, and then this on top of it, it makes me think their new manager is not running this place correctly.",Taste,Customer Service,,

They made the cinnamon bites first, which were of course not even the slightest bit warm by the time I got my 2 pizzas 21 minutes later. Yes, the bites were done in the first five, then the pumped out a bunch of regular cheese/pepperoni pizzas which took 21 more minutes to get me my stuffed crust. Also I had ordered 2 medium stuffed crust, which should have been $6 additional for the stuffed crust per their menu ( 3 for med, 3.50 for large) but was charged $7. Whrn I asked about it the cashier stated it was 3.50 each, I pointed to the sign which said 3...and he again said 3.50.

"I live pretty close and shop here often. They recently re-arranged the store, which has made things hard to find. It also seems like certain items aren't being restocked. I'm mainly seeing this problem with reloading supplies. It would be nice to see some improvements in this area, as ordering powder, primers, etc. in Alaska is a real pain.

I would also think that the economy of scale afforded by such a large company would enable them to offer more competitive pricing, but that's usually not the case. Many (if not most) items can be found for lower prices elsewhere.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the checkout process is ridiculous and overcomplicated. They really need to streamline this. There is no sense in soliciting phone numbers when our state has only one area code.

All things considered, it's still a neat store and I'll continue to shop around here from time to time.",Taste,Price,,

Drink orders came out promptly but appetizers took 45 minutes and the meal took 1 hr 15 mins. Wait staff was apologetic and blamed it on a new chef and his crew. Pretty expensive also. When we finally got our meal, it was excellent. Chef special halibut definitely top 5. In spite of the great food, i doubt I'll be back.

"I was just in yesterday looking for a helmet with a heated visor.  I found some 509 R3 Helmets that caught my attention, but was confused that the R3 was modular in design.  I left and did some web research to confirm and found that (I believe) they are putting 509 R4 Helmets in R3 boxes and keeping the pricing at the R3 price ($150 more vs. the R4 price).

According to the 509 Website, the Delta R3 Carbon Fiber Ignite helmet is NOT a modular helmet, the Delta R4 Ignite is a modular helmet (and $150 less).

Purchased my 509 R4 on-line from a reputable source.   In part due to size selection, but I wouldn't have gone back after seeing their (assumed intentional) methods of mis-marking items.",Taste,Price,,

"I have always liked the Three Bears Organization and the much needed services they provide their smaller communities. It's very close to having a Costco. I frequent them in Big Lake. They generally have what I need and a lot of what I want. However, based on my experience the last couple of months, I plan to shop elsewhere, which will prove difficult since the choices in or near Big Lake are none and few, respectively.

Unlike Costco, Three Bears stores do not have a mask mandate. I was there a week ago. Out of about 50 customers, 4 in addition to me were wearing masks. Out of a dozen staff assisting customers, only 2 were wearing masks. My cashier wasn't wearing one. What was even more disgusting to me was the food preppers and servers in the deli weren't wearing masks, not one!

I am a senior citizen. I have an underlying health condition, and even if I didn't, I don't want to be exposed to Covid 19. It doesn't bother me that another elderly woman laughed at me for wearing a mask; it bothers me a large portion of the population in the Mat-Su are treating masks politically. I heard some one say, ""A mask isn't a political statement; it's an IQ test."" Its sad to say, in the area, concern for one's neighbor is low.

Again, if you need to shop, it fills the need. If you care about your health, take precautions and be prepared for ridicule.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"First of all the staff were excellent from the moment we walked in. There were also some local folks that helped us out immensely. More about that later. The food was prepared perfectly to order and the wait staff was very professional. The salad bar was very very good with a great selection. We had the prime rib with baked potato. Perfectly prepared. I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Turtle Club

Now to the local folks. We arrived about an hour and a half early. I decided to turn around and go for a ride to kill some time before our reservation. Well I got stuck and could not get out no matter what I tried. So we walked down to the restaurant figuring we would have to get a wrecker during or after our meal. Unbeknownst to us someone from the wait staff in the bar saw what happened and was ready to assist us before we even walked in. Then some of the sweetest folks just pulled me out and said that now I could enjoy my evening which we certainly did. It says alot about  the local area. I was very appreciative.",Taste,Customer Service,,

Dr. Jerz was very clear about what she hoped to accomplish and told me that it wasn't going to happen right a way. In the last month I've noticed my pain decrease, I'm able to do more and I'm not reaching for the Tylenol, ice, and heat everytime I finish a chore like I was. That had changed my skepticism into hope.

Any questions I asked that the receptionist did not know asked the Vet after we got off and called m back. They were able to adjust their schedule enough to get cowboy in that day. Dr. Pestch (spelling) did an amazing job and cowboy was back to normal within a few days. The entire team was amazing.

"Went in this morning to purchase a 1/4"" Rigid impact that was on sale. Found it easy, found a lady working to help with the item because it has a security tag no problem. She asks if I'm ready to checkout and I say, ""Yes."" She takes me to a self checkout and the girl scans my item, turns out its card only and I'm paying cash. #1.    She then takes the item to register 6 and I wait in line behind people that have an item with a partial tag and need to verify it. The checkout lady could have checked me thru while we waited several minutes to have a gentleman come out and verify the item. #2 As I'm in line the lady who originally got the item for me looks at me with a confused face, I tell her I was paying cash and she said come with me. Pulled me out of line to take me to a register thats closed and was not operational. No offense I've had enough. 40 mind for something I had in my hand in 10 is ridiculous. I was better off just going to the Abbott store, in and out in 10-15 minutes. Stellar service over there, Tudor not so much. Which is a big bummer because that's the big store with the inventory.

"This place could be such a wonderful stop! It has all the components to draw folks to be here and want to come back. The food was good, the gift store interesting and the lady, Nina, running the place was nice. What made this place challenging was that Nina is pushy to buy food or charge you to take photos inside. She wasn't as warm in the beginning but became so with time. I would suggest that you still visit but be ready to say no to food and continue to talk to Nina.",Quality,Experience,,
Had the yellow curry chicken.  It was delicious! The house soup was great too except the chicken in it was dry... go figure! I love the fresh roll.

"Disclaimer: we did take-out and cannot speak to wait staff or any other customer service. First off, the prices were high, $18 for Orange chicken in a container the size of a Panda Express 2 item entree, which is like $10. Secondly, the chow mein was literally the fried, crunchy chow mein noodles you can buy in the grocery store, just doused in sauce to make them soft. I'm not making this up. It was loaded with veggies and a portion of meat. All in all, not very impressed. I think the reason they get great reviews is because they are the only Chinese, or maybe any Asian, restaurant in town.",Taste,Customer Service,,

Have to change this review! We went last month and my sons nachos were absolutely burnt and the hot sauce looked like clear Thai sauce. He couldnt eat it of coarse. My Taco salad bowl was half full and I only asked for beans and rice. But a restaurant can have a bad day and we went back.  Sons tacos were completely different. Chicken meat smelled like dog food. It was not marinated. Just boiled chicken and completely covered in onions and cilantro. Two items he cannot eat. Threw it away and never going back.",Restaurant,Price,,

"The food is mediocre. It's not the worst. But that is not why they get 1 star from me.

They robbed me, for almost nothing. The short female server with the short-ish haircut stole 2$ from me. I called in a pickup order. I came in when they said it would be ready. It wasn't ready. It was about 20 minutes late. When it was ready and sitting on the counter the lady saw it and tended to her tables and collected her tips before cashing me out. It was a little rude of her but everyone has a bad day. When she did get around to cashing me out she printed the receipt and handed it to me and said ""Can you 'fill' this out and sign it?"" I thought she was barking mad expecting a tip on not only a carry-out but a very late one at that. So I drew a line through the section with the tip and signed it. I didn't think I had to write more than that since I had my copy. Well the wife got the bank statement and she wrote in a 2$ tip for herself. We thought about calling the bank, but if they are willing to rob a local for 2$ then they will never get my business again. I'll save myself 2$ and eat somewhere else.",Restaurant,Local,,

They were efficient and nice. I had a bill there for a long time. I will say I didn’t have any word about it at first and when they used to call me I guess the identification for their number was labeled unknown so I didn’t know it was them. Now their number shows and it’s all paid.,Experience,,None,
"This is a fun place to shop. They have arts and crafts, gifts, bikes, skis, greeting cards, clothes and lots more. Their prices are ok for Alaska. The sales tax is high because they are on the Kenai Peninsula Borough and in the Soldotna city limits. Today, I bought a pair of slippers and saw a friend who was looking for a fuzzy boa to dress up her dog.",Location,Price,,
"(Translated by Google) Stayed here for four days and felt a little sorry for such a high score. The accommodation itself belongs to the homestay, a more traditional house, and it is also very warm inside, so people feel comfortable when they go in. However, after living for a few days, I found a lot of problems: 1. The bed is a bunk bed, the ladder on the upper bunk is very difficult to climb, and because the mattress is too high, there is no protective measure around the bed; 2. Charging is very troublesome, the bed is not charged. The blanket can only be placed on the ground in the distance; 3. The blanket is too thin. The four people we live with include me. There are three people who have a cold. Although there is heating, it is very cold in the middle of the night and wake up in the morning, especially for colds. The location is too far from the city, there is a bus stop at the door, but it doesn't take 3 minutes to freeze. If you don't drive by yourself, it is not recommended. 5. The wooden house is especially badly soundproof and the sleep quality is not good. Be cautious, because there are people who come back in the middle of the night; 6. There is a kitchen, but it is very small, and breakfast has never been eaten.

在这住了四天 感觉有点对不起这么高的评分。住宿本身属于民宿，比较传统的房子，里面也很温馨的感觉，让人进去就觉得很舒服。不过住了几天发现问题下不少：1.床位是上下铺，上铺的梯子很不好爬，并且因为床垫太高床的四周没有任何保护措施；2.充电很麻烦，床头没有充电的，只能放在远处的地上；3.毯子太薄，我们一起住的四个人包括我一个有三个人感冒，虽然有暖气，但是半夜和早上醒来还是很冷，特别容易感冒；4. 位置离市区太远，门口有公交车站很近，但这边冻透不需要3分钟，如果不自驾又是一个人的话不推荐住；5. 木房子隔音特别差，睡眠质量不好的慎重，因为这边旅游经常有人半夜回来；6. 有厨房，但是很小，早餐从来没吃过。",Quality,Convenience,,

"We went in for a normal boys cut for 2 of my sons.  All I said was longer on top and shorter on the side.  Pretty simple.  Both boys cuts weren't great, but one of my sons was absolutely horrible.  It was ridiculously choppy and he wound up with a Simple Jack look.  I brought him back for a redo and felt bad that another stylist had to spend her time fixing someone else's mistake, so I paid for the haircut again. She did better but it was pretty hard to make it look good after the original.  Usually the cuts aren't perfect, but theyre cheap and the app is convenient.  I guess I'll be switching.",Taste,Convenience,,

We called three different places starting from the food service number listed in the hotel directory. Second, they have window mounted AC units.

Modern bar that was pretty busy. They looked like they were a bit short staffed for a while. The only bartender did a good job being friendly and trying to get everyone drinks.

Lots of things on the menu for both meals and snacks as well as drinks. The seating is currently outside but who wouldn’t want to sit outside on a beautiful day. The fish and chips are a staple that was done well. There’s a small bar inside with fun interior decorations.,Restaurant,Ambiance,,

"Numerous examples of a poorly run place, but the best was someone had blocked me in from leaving. The person (seemingly in their own vehicle) was talking to an employee. They were laughing and carrying on with one another, all while I waited to leave. Then, the person gets out of their vehicle and walks away. And it's not as though they had just blocked me into a parking spot, but rather I was pulling around from the back of the building to leave and had to stop for them. More than one employee was in view of all this and said nothing that they may want to move their vehicle and not block the exit. It's a really tight lot to begin with. Not once did I have a positive experience going to this place.",Location,Customer Service,,

It arrived to the table six minutes after I got my sandwich.  $16 for about 3 ounces of fish on a pitiful bun with one piece of lettuce and one slice of tomato, stale potato chips and a side of mayo with speckles of what might have been herbs but had no flavor to distinguish them.

It wasn't easy either, but Jason went above and beyond to get the right parts and everything installed to ensure my car was running again.
Now I own a new car and being a single mom and small business owner, I don't have a lot of time and definitely don't have any mechanical knowledge- I've joined their VIP program so now I have nothing to worry about.

"Went in to Zushi tonight and immediately noticed how much nicer the restaurant was. It had a stellar atmosphere. You could quickly tell something had changed. Upon meeting the owner who was courteous, polite and efficient. We found that ownership had changed.  The change was clearly for the better. Everything from the flavored water, homemade soy, and top tier quality sushi. I was extremely impressed with how beautiful the dishes were presented. The flavor encompassed the perfect blend of seasonings and fish. This sushi restaurant is great looking and it seems all aspects have been addressed to include wonderful decorations and unique cutlery. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone who wants to have a quality meal at an affordable price. The sushi was by far the best we have had in the Matsu valley. We will be visiting this location more often.  Bonus also that they recognize our military present and past offering a discount which most fine dining restaurants do not.",Taste,Price,,

We all haven't drank alcohol in months and definitely didn't have any alcohol on us. So we got to eat cold food for having to wait so long... thanks taco bell!",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

The building needs a remodel and has no ventilation and the wait staff is absolutely horrible, and disrespectful.  I will NEVER eat here again.

"Denali National Park and Preserve is a beautiful place with lands untouched by man. It is important to note that Denali is more of a preserve than a ""park."" Cars are not allowed beyond the bus station. You must buy a bus ticket to go to Eielson Visitor Center. If you buy a bus ticket, you can get off the bus at any stop and catch another bus later. The only problem with this is, the buses are really full, and it's very hard to find a bus that has room for you. At Eielson there is a ranger that will put you on a waiting list, and they control how many people get back on the buses from there so it is easier to get back on a bus there than at other stops.
I should also add, there is no where to buy food or drinks past the bus station, so make sure you bring all you will need for a full days' adventure!

I can't say anything about the rest of the things they serve but they shouldn't make donuts anymore or get someone else to make them. Golden donuts is still the best in Anchorage and cheaper",Taste,Price,,

"Pretty solid rental place, but fails on the marine side. Can’t rent a boat until 0930. By the time you get out of there it’s 10am. Almost all decent fishing grounds (ocean) are at least 3.5-5hrs away. We got our boat at 10 on Friday, drove 4 hours to Homer, put the boat in the water and motored to the fishing grounds(another 1.5 hours). That put us at about 6 hours (4pm)just to get fishing. Now here is your biggest dilemma; do you fish longer hours and drive back tired? Or fish for a couple hours so you can drive back with energy. This is all of course if you rent the boat for just one day. But even if you rent multiple days, your first days rental you end up spending more time driving and putting the boat in and out of the water than you actually spend on the water. I understand there is nothing the outdoor rec can do to fix drive time, but they have options.
When a boat is returned they leave the day after vacant so they can prep and maintain every boat before it gets rented again(actually a great practice). Here is where my issue is; this means the boat is just sitting in the lot from 6pm-930am the next day. Why not let a renter pick it up(if ready of course) the evening before so they can either get in the road that evening or leave at 5am like most of us fishiest like to do. I understand there might be delays if the boat is still being worked on, but the majority of all know this is the case and are more than willing to wait later that evening if needed. Anything is better than having to wait until 10am to get I the road no matter how many days you’ve rented. At the least just open the office earlier to customers (employees are already at work at 8am) who are renting ocean boats. Help us deep sea fishers out!",Taste,Customer Service,,

UPDATE: I was reviewed the policy for Alaska and how the lower 48 doesn’t apply for Alaska but they use an 907 # for a out of state call box.

I would have updated to a 4 star but it’ll now be a 1 star because of there ridiculous prices and method they use which is called “book time”

"This is a bit more than moderate hiking it's on the verge of strenuous but most everybody that's in pretty well shape can do it just take your time relax and enjoy You do not have to climb the top of the high part of the glacier to enjoy the scene or majesty of how great and massive glaciers are!
I am on the larger side but had no problem navigating with just some good hiking boots on It will get to your knees after a while because you're walking on ice and there's no cushion. The guided tours look informative and they do supply you with some extra equipment but we felt like that wasn't quite necessary so we did the self-guided tour just to see what it was all about and had more than enough enjoyment three and a half hours gone just like a snap of a fingers And about 200 pictures later we were back at our car enjoying the ride home.
If you have the time this is a must do it's the closest glacier to parking and the easiest navigable due to them setting up cones on the best places to walk. they don't give you much of an instruction manual as long as you're walking on the rocks dirt or the crunchiness of the ice especially where little trails of water running you won't have too many issues it's when you get up on top of the ice where it's slick.",Taste,Experience,,

Oh yeah, and their bisque and crab cakes were to die for, but took up space that should have been filled with another massive crab leg!

chicken curry for dinner personally I like rice with my curry and it came with bread other than that I thought it was good .  I believe I saw hydroponics trailer behind the restaurants I would imagine they are growing their own vegetables especially from what I tasted I have not tasted that fresh vegetables in a while .  We were given a free bread pudding dessert by our server and it was good. Great place for a date or dinner with loved ones. Maybe business lunch. Anyway can’t wait to try the Waffles!",Taste,Customer Service,,

This isn't one to miss, as they are serving up dishes that are unique to our food scene and delicious across-the-board (and the presentation is fantastic)!

Voted Best Pizza in Alaska and is nationally recognized. Incredible pizza with lots of wheat/gluten free options.

Staff was friendly. They helped me pick out most things I needed. There was a few things they didn't have so I went to Amazon to pick up the other things. That's when I discovered I had paid more than double for everything at Southside than what I saw on Amazon. I don't mind paying a bit more over internet prices to support local but it really stings to find out you just got raked over the coals. Of course no returns except for store credit..I checked the reviews here before I shopped and no one mentions prices. Well here it is. They are horrific. I could see using this place as maybe an emergency source bit other than that I would just order online if you're not in a hurry.,Taste,Customer Service,,

"This place is awesome.  From the assortment of toys, not all of which I would really go so far as to call classic, it's easy to get lost, it is only a small drawback.  The employees are pretty great as well.  This post was edited on 2/28/2018 for clarity and understanding.  The drawback of classic versus nonclassic toys is not why I rated it four stars.  In recognition of the store being great, the 4 stars is strictly due to parking availability.  It is much easier to park farther away and visit but the nearby parking options ('Barnes and Noble' and Dennys) can be treacherous depending on weather and small children accompanying the visit.",Taste,Convenience,,

Way too long of a wait for mine and my husband's food. We ordered right before a table of 4 and they had eaten and left before our food came. We had to ask if it was coming.
The food was not good, unfortunately. For how they price their menu I expected more. The halibut fish and chips was distasteful.  The batter was thick which made the halibut taste off. We had waited so long for our food by the time we got it we were ready to leave.
My husband had the Mount St. Elias. He only had a few bites of it.

"This shop belongs to Safeway, there are no local products at all. 4 stars for not having enough fish choice. In such place like Alaska I would expect more fish. We took last package of frozen pollock. And there was only frozen halibut left. There was choice of frozen shrimps. Big selection of meat. I understand that in such a remote place the food would be more expensive. For comparison..  1gallon of 2% milk is 6.29$, 12 eggs not organic 5.49$, bananas 1.79$, avocado 3.49 $/each. In general there is a big choice, not huge of course, also household items and kids toys.The stuff is nice and helpful. We were happy that we could buy food here.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

"The employees were nice enough and I'm always happy for new things to try, but overall I had to give it a low rating due to taste. The ice cream tastes like they bought dipping dots and just squished the dots, rolled it flat and re-served it to me. The topping choices they put in their signature creations are just weird and do nothing for the flavor. Mine came with fruit loops, Pocky sticks and a whole oreo shoved on top.

First we waited till 9 for the better price but the guy didn't give it to us because they decided to not do it till 930 even though online said 9. So we waited.
We purchased 2 games for each of us and they stopped it in the middle of our second game and said we had to pay more, then they said we had to show them receipts that they never gave us, so I recommend getting a receipt every time.
It was mostly a hassle and we just wanted to pay and play.
Its really too bad because I don't want to go back die to how a lot of the fun was taken away from our experience, I'd rather try a different ally then go back here.
I hope the best for this allies success, I recommend better policies and sticking with the website or updating the website so that prices aren't confusing.
For customers I recommend checking the website and what's getting rung up, as well as asking for all receipts.",Taste,Customer Service,,

Washers work ok, but the dryers basically don’t work, and the owner stated that he is not fixing the machines because “the Canadians keep breaking them”, apparently by using Canadian quarters.

"Large, hearty portions of steaming hot noodles. Small dining room. Fair price, especially considering the bowls are big enough to share. Pay attention to the heat rating...spicy means SPICY here. My daughter found out the hard way and found her Kimchi Ramen too intense. The gracious server offered to remake as a non-spicy dish without an extra charge, and they let us keep both. (By the way, this is not to say the Kimchi Ramen was anything less than delicious!)

This is the sort of business that everyone should cheer for but not enough people do. Small, local, authentic, and really good. Yet the telltale signs of financial struggle are present. It's a vibe you get that maybe the place won't be open much longer. It'll be sad if that proves true.",Taste,Price,,

"The woman at this store is so uneducated about fish. (Older with white hair, I'm noticing other reviews mention the same woman)

1st experience she rolled her eyes and told us it takes 6 months to set up a salt water tank and if it is our first tank we shouldn't attempt it.  We left that day and went to a specialty fish store who laughed at the statement and were very dissapointed she would discourage new people.

2nd experience she first claimed it was impossible to put female bettas together (youtube betta sorority tank, it is a thing) she refused to sell 4 female bettas.  She claims the store attempted this and within a day only 1 survived.... Last time we go to this store for fish...  alaska fish and coral will now be our only fish store!

Update! After 2 weeks I have 4 female Bettas that I purchased from Alaska Fish and Coral.
They are all getting along in my tank with a male betta as well.  They are not stressed or fighting.  I hope the lady that works there becomes more educated.",Experience,,None,

"Chena Hot Springs Resort is an excellent place to go, to unwind, to hike, to just plain experience.
You will not be disappointed.
Go visit, and maybe plan a several days' stay. There is so much to experience at the Resort.
There is a restaurant/gift shop. The food is top notch. Warning: The big bowl of clam chowder is gigantic, you may just want the bowl, rather than the big bowl. It was super-delicious, but way too big to get half-way through.
There is an ""ice castle"", the hot springs, that you can soak in, hiking trails, a duck and moose pond, and most likely much more that I missed.
Go check it out, you won't be disappointed. Well worth the time and effort to visit.",Taste,Experience,,

"There is eating for food and then there is eating to be nourished.  There are many Thai food places here in Fairbanks, yet today I found my favorite place.  I got the House Noodle at the hot spice level.  I was excited to try their home made noodles and I love the large noodles that come with three of their dishes.   The woman who took my to go order made me feel welcomed and respected.  The experience felt like being an honored guest in her home, yet it is a  restaurant.  I almost cried as she has a radiating spirit that reminds me of my own favorite Aunties.  I was so humbled by her hospitality and grace.  Fast forward to actually trying the famous noodles and I had a feeling it would be good but was unprepared for it to be life changingly good.  Yummy to the power of yummy.  Awesome spice level.  Huge portion. The Noodles!  A revolution in texture and flavor.  I seriously don’t want to go to any other Thai restaurant in Fairbanks until I have tried everything on the menu at The Noodle House.  Awesome fresh rolls and iced coffee.  This place is extraordinary and the food is extra special.   Looking forward to returning to dine in.   This place is a place to nourish your body, mind and spirit.",Taste,Variety,,

"Not all lift operators are created equal; and, if only going round-trip, once, it's an expensive ride! Those two things being said, as a local, I love the tram. The views are stellar and it's a wonderful experience to see Juneau from new heights without hiking up a mountain on one's own to do so.

Most of the tramway 🚡 operators are knowledgeable, out-going, and enjoy what they do. I have yet to meet an employee working the tram that I didn't like! Be aware that the tram, as it's being docked at the top, does slow down and rock gently back and forth prior to it lodging firmly into place for your safe exit on the top of Mount Roberts. If you have a fear of heights, the rocking motion may make you uneasy; and, it's important to note, the tram does have you riding above treetops. If afraid of heights, look out and not down! The lift takes about 5 minutes to go up and 5 minutes to go back down and is made available for either direction within reasonably spaced, short intervals. Once off-loaded, at the top of Mount Roberts, take your time to enjoy the Nature Center, the Gift Shop, Grab a Bite to Eat, and find your way to Father Brown's Cross for Amazing, Awe-inspiring Views that seem like movie back-drops but are perfectly real; a place where time stands still.

What goes up, must come down; thankfully, a tram like the one in Juneau is safe, secure, and smooth. It seems to glide as it brings you back down to earth. It's a brilliant contraption that's well maintained and kept clean. If a tourist, the expensive, round-trip ticket is worth the cost for a once in a lifetime experience like none other. If a local, the season pass would be a good thing to nab as it'll save you money and allow you to travel, by tram, as often as you'd like. 😊",Taste,Price,,

"The only campground we stay at when in Delta. Not large, not fancy but has a comfortable feel to it.  It's in town and an IGA grocery store that is amazing. We have a 31 foot motorhome and can park in any of the campsites. There is designated tent sites as well. A clean and maintained camp that is $15 a night,  which is average for a dry camp here in Alaska. Stop by if you can.

They were out of some things and we didn't know until they brought our food out. My food was brought out last and then it was wrong - so everyone was done eating by the time my food was corrected and brought out.

They are more than happy to help and guide you to what it is you're looking for. If you need a glass case opened you simply have to make eye contact with an employee and they're on their way!

Hidden cost, contracts are changed ,information untrue. This place was an inheritance  and now in hands of grandchildren they did what grandparents did not want...make money off people .   I knew the original owners. Too bad.

Diamond M= be fair. It cost a lot to come to Ak.   to see our state. You do not need to charge so much. Start a new reputation as a gift.

Thankyou for sharing. That is what is lacking. Be a part of a better world. Help the poor. They are thrown around. Help the wealthy. They are used. Change , help share Ak. You charge to much. By your actions you can help the children. Free. You were given, now give more freely.

Why havent you ,btw,open up something, somewhere  for the underprivileged singled ,disabled Alaskans that are homeless?   Tiny homes. Help the year around senior disabled citizens that built Alaska before you were even here. Theres a reputation to be proud of.",Location,Price,,

"Was recommended by a friend of my girlfriends that said it was pretty good a while back. I know that recently the owners were changed and I have no idea what the food was like prior to this changed, but when we went it was absolutely awful.

When we were ordering, I got a look around and the place looks honestly a bit run down and not that great. The seats are torn up and the walls are all beat up.

About 10 minutes later the waiter came back and told me the item I ordered, an Eggs Benedict, they didn't have enough ingredients for and I had to choose something else. I should have just walked out right then, but I decided to stick it through and ordered something else.

Worst mistake right there. The food was awful and the service was worse. It was also over $50 for just 2 entrees and a couple drinks, nothing else. Everything on the menu was incredibly expensive (More than it should be, I should say) and does not prove that its anywhere worthy of those prices.

Never go here. Go to village inn if you're looking for good breakfast food, or look for somewhere else that isn't here. It'll save you money and disappointment.",Taste,Customer Service,,

Your establishment is very clean, your staff are personable and are always willing to help, even if they are not sure, they go out of their way to find out for me. Our room was spacious and clean. Beds are so very comfortable, I found it difficult to get out of them at times lol. I’m sad I have to return home to Virginia but best believe that when I tell the folks back home of my Alaska trip, the Aptel Studio Hotel will be included! When I come back I WILL stay here again, without a doubt!

Thank you so very much for being a part of this memorable experience.

Okay, so on oct 19th i will be coming up to Alaska from Virginia Beach to visit family and our family home, and will be staying for 14 days... it is been over 19 years since I have been back I had another booking with a different hotel. I decided on this one because of the kitchenette. Before I canceled my previous booking with the other hotel. I spoke to a wonderful young lady. I had a concern about check in. It noted that check in ends at 10:30 pm. My flight is supposed to land before that but I have to pick up my rental car. She eased my mind and told me it was fine that I could just call and let security know I’m checking in from a flight. She was so lovely and I’m excited to stay here. However, I read the reviews just now and see a few complaint about not having kitchen supplies... the kitchenette was the main reason for choosing this place. I seen the staff reply to one review stating they do have supply boxes but it is limited, I do hope there are some available when we get there in two weeks. I already spent an insane amount to even make this trip possible... I’d hate to buy kitchen supplies that I won’t even be bringing back with me afterwards... I’ll update review once we arrive/after our stay. Crosses fingers/here’s hoping!!",Taste,Customer Service,,

"The employees' hospitality make it worth coming back. Otherwise, its nothing special compared to other movie theatres. Something I really dont like is how you have to wait in line to refill your drink/popcorn. They should have a separate line for this so that youre not missing your movie; especially because those snack lines get pretty long and they only have 2-3 employees working. It would also be nice if they posted that they dont charge for a 2yr old in the Standard movie rooms. This wouldve saved me some money, on all the previous times, before one of the employees mentioned it.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

What a great place to go. Definitely following the covid and social distancing guidelines. A big and full menu. You are sure to find something that you will love. Awesome and friendly staff. Good atmosphere.  Had no problem answering questions or even wiping down our table again, as we asked. My friend ordered a diet coke and the ox tail phone. He said is was delicious.  I personally couldn't belive how big thr bowl for the phone was. I ordered the pork Lao sausage.  It was a little spicy but not too bad. The stick rice and veggies it came with, helped with that. I also had a Thai iced tea. Both were very yummy. Im so glad it went.  I am sure you will be too.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Highly qualified and professional doctors, specialists and staff. I have been a patient here on and off for years  but recently I've been working with Dr. Lorenz since 2015.  I have a relatively complicated situation, and have had experienced a lot of discrimination and negative bedside manner when doctors could not diagnose the problem.  I've only had positive experiences with this organization.  Dr. Lorenz has taken great care to determine the best course of action, if any is necessary, and is great at ensuring that the patient understands the information that is necessary for their health. The only drawback, if you feel the need for one, is that the location is in a medical office area on the north edge of downtown where most people don't travel to very often.  Access to the area is great, and there is plenty of parking on street, adjacent to the building if the parking lot is ever full.   And sometimes you have to wait a month out for an appointment.  If you need a specialist, I'd surely recommend these folks first.",Taste,Customer Service,,

The staff are always friendly, give great advice on hair upkeep and have got a great sense humour. The manager is who I always request as she cuts my hair perfectly. There is another lady, I don't like putting names out there on these reviews, that cuts my hair perfectly too. So, if the manager isn't there I'll have her cut my hair. That said, the entire staff is great and skillful at their craft and anyone of them could cut my hair easily and just as perfect. I'm just picky and like these two ladies specifically to cut my hair.

I have loved stars of Alaska if I found it 5 years ago. The store has any and every type of Agate or Crystal that you can think of offhand. They had dishes fashioned out of agate wind chimes with crystals dream catchers with feathers. And then they have antique glass and Oriental antiques from the war that have swords that jewelry dishes toys absolutely anything! But... they also have a woman who considers herself the utmost Authority on everything to the point of being rude to a young girl. I've also noticed over the last year-and-a-half her merchandise has almost doubled in price and last year at the State Fair when asked if she had any materials used for smudging abruptly snapped at me and said no and then when I showed her an example of what she had on display she argues with me telling me that's not what that was!

It took about another 30 minutes before they brought my husband and my food out. I had the berries and cream waffle that came with bacon eggs and has brown. They brought out the same waffle they had first brought out that they rewarmed in the microwave and I knw that because it was hard as heck and stuck to the paper plate they serve the food on and the fruit on the waffle was rotten. The has brown and eggs were good and it was seasoned good. The bacon had a rough chew like it was rewarmed in the microwave too. My husband had the Dixie chix waffle. He said it was good.

We flew over several mountains in the south part of the Mount Denali and eventually was lucky to see the highest peak in North America!

The staff was friendly, the decor was very well done, beautiful and clean with simple table settings and dark wood. The menu, although limited, was delicious! One of the specials was a New York strip with veggies & garlic mashed potatoes and it was by far the best steak I have ever had. I asked for medium and it was perfect! I asked to sub the garlic mashed potatoes for double veggies and they had no issue with it. My husband, son, and daughter all had burgers and we're very pleased with them.

"My fettuccini Alfredo tasted fantastic, originally $13.  I then added mushrooms $3 as listed on the menu.  I inquired about adding shrimp. She said they can do it but didn’t let me know what the price was. I expected it wouldn’t be that expensive. Was I surprised!  The up charge was $12. (That’s $3 a shrimp for 4 of them).  Absurd.
From the start there was no silverware she forgot that request, actually we had to get up and get it ourself.  She kept forgetting things.  Each time she ran back to get something it took several minutes. It appeared that she was serving another table before grabbing an item she forgot.  The clean and nice. Just not sure why serving us was so difficult. It wasn’t that busy on a Sunday night. We only had a side salad, the fettuccine, a hot chocolate and a dessert.",Taste,Price,,

"A throwback to a simpler time. One of the last true ""roadhouse"" type joints in Alaska. I saw several plates come out while I was waiting, and all the dishes looked hearty and well put together. I stuck with a classic diner bacon cheeseburger, and it was spot on. Griddle fried bun, lots of melty cheese, and nice thick bacon on top of a 1/3 lb beef patty. The pies are legendary, and if I hadn't had another 200 miles to go, I would have indulged. Great food in a picturesque locale.",Taste,Customer Service,,

The hot dog was ok, but for $5 I was expecting a bigger hot dog. The chili fries were made with generic Sysco (food service) crinkle fries and the chili was canned Hormel-quality chili. At least use Wolf Chili without beans, goddamnit. Don't know why it took so long to make my order, I was the only customer at the time.

"Here's an edit after an amazing response from management which made me stop and rethink.

I'd complained I didn't like the lack of a lift to take baggage upstairs. The lack of air con. And the disastrous bath design.

The response was to say they'd strip out the baths. Rethink aircon and reconsider luggage. I'm impressed. A management that responds like this is one I'd support, I regret not meeting them when I was there.

Still no safe in the room.

I raise it to 3star.  Gracious of me I know. But thank hotel management for taking suggestions seriously and in good humour.

If you have issues, address them with these guys on site. A rarety is a management that listens. Cheers",Quality,Travel,,

I called at 11:30am to ask her if she would be interested in collaborating with my employers wine tasting by providing great pairings. She was abrupt when I couldn't speak fast enough for her.

"Two lessons in and I want more. I can’t decide which was more fun, working on the bouldering walls or belaying. A great deal of thought and technique are used in this sport, so the time passed so quickly. I can see how people who take climbing up as a hobby end up working at gyms like this, it would be easy to spend the day wanting to push yourself further. My instructors, Spencer and Jeff, were both excellent (and patiently endured my complete lack of experience). Membership at the gym isn’t required for introductory courses, so anyone can give it a try without making a huge commitment. If you do decide to join, they also have a full gym that is available for use. There are great deals for families and they have an option, for a very nominal fee, to allow your membership to go dormant if you snowbird or just want to slack for awhile. If your a beginner, like me, just come with the attitude that kids shorter than your knee will surpass you from the start...humbling and endearing all at once!

"Just so you know getting a five-star review for me is very difficult. So if you've earned a four-star review count yourself lucky. The wait staff was super friendly and attentive. He answered all of my questions happily. He recommended an appetizer that was off the charts delicious! Highly recommend the tostaditos! Super delicious and huge! I also got the Tijuana taco which was pretty good but stuffed so full and so sloppy I couldn't eat it like a taco and had to eat it with a fork. I also ordered the fajita supreme with both steak and chicken. It was pretty delicious came out sizzling and amazing only thing is they forgot the mushrooms which was the reason why I got the supreme in the first place. However I didn't realize they forgot mushrooms until we were boxing things up to go. I'm sure they would have made it right if I would have said something.
I did specify the ranchero beans versus the refried beans for the fajitas and they came out refried. But that's not a deal-breaker. I've been to gallos A few times before and they make excellent margaritas too. not this trip but on a previous trip I ordered the taquitos and they gave me the flautas instead only problem with this is that I'm allergic to gluten so I was not able to eat that. They tried to make it right and sent out another plate of flautas 😂",Taste,Customer Service,,

"This is a great hike! The trail to get to the glacier isn’t bad at all and I’ve seen folks in all different physical conditions make it there (it’s about 50 minutes round-trip). There’s a wheelchair accessible portion of the trail that gets you to a viewpoint of the glacier, which I believe is one of the few in the Seward area. The drive in to get to the trailhead is beautiful and there are signs on the drive and on the trail showing years indicating where the glacier was at that particular year. The trail breaks off into the Harding Icefield Trail, which is a bit of a doozy. It’s on our “to-do” list, but just making it to Marmot Meadows (Stop 1 of 3 on that trail) was pretty exhausting. Rangers walk up to that point and do guides tours as well, which is nice.  Definitely worth checking out if you’re in the area!

Note: The road into the park is closed to cars during the winter. You could walk on the road, but it’s too long of a journey on foot unless you just want to get to the first pull-out/viewing area.",Taste,Convenience,,

Then, asked for my receipt at the register for already-purchased makeup and looked at like I had stole it until my fiancé came back with an unbroken case of soda since one was broke and empty in the box. I guess with the ghetto side of town that's what a person can expect. Didn't find any corks in the arts aisle or in the kitchen utensils aisle either.

"This was the worst motel/hotel experience I've ever had. My partner and I just moved and purchased a new bed. Unfortunately, the delivery of our new bed was delayed a day and we found ourselves with only the floor to sleep on, so we decided to find a hotel for the night. When we arrived at La Quinta, we told the folks at the front desk as much and asked for a room. I had also called asking if they had a room with a big bed available. They said  yes and when we arrived, I mentioned I was the one who had called about ten minutes prior. Even with all of this information and the rainbow Pride masks my partner and I were wearing, the homophobic receptionist put us in a room with two queens instead of a single king bed. Even if they were somehow confused, maybe because they lacked a well-rounded and cultured upbringing, they should always ask to clarify rather than assume. Rather than argue with the likely bigoted and unaccommodating receptionist, we decided to cope and squeezed into one of the queen sized beds because it was at least still better than the floor, I guess. When we woke up, we found breakfast was what a first grader might expect from a school cafeteria. In fact, I am certain the small cup of odd tasting, sour orange juice was the same stuff they gave us in elementary school. The $2 breakfast and awful customer service have left us certain to look elsewhere going forward. In the future, we know to check in with the local LGBTQIA+ community to know where to take our queer dollars. What a shame a restful nights sleep could be so soured.",Taste,Customer Service,,
"I really have to give them some credit for being generous with their portions. I ordered a take out from them and then when I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised with their generous portion.

Just be thankful and take it home for your next meal.",Restaurant,,None,

"Started today with a cinnamon vanilla latte at a coffee shop I wish I had the opportunity to visit more often. Dark Horse sits between the Denaina Convention Center, City Hall and the Robert Atwood Building, so they are always busy. But the atmosphere is always warm and the drinks are always great, so being part of the crowd here makes perfect sense. They also offer french press and tea pots for only $7, so it is easy to enjoy an extended morning stay while you read one of their complimentary Anchorage Daily News papers.  What I love most though, everyone is treated with respect here. I’ve know a few people between homes and jobs who might not have been welcomed in other establishments but are able to spend time out of the cold, enjoying a cup of coffee and a friendly game of cards (or one of the other games they have for customers to use). Their menu is good as well...extremely generous oatmeal portions!",Taste,Customer Service,,

We also had drinks. One of our drinks, the crown and water, was very watery. When we asked that it be fixed or changed, that server rudely told us that it was because it was a crown and water and that they are strict about making sure the crown is exactly 2.5 oz. We then asked for crown without water and mixed it with the same amount of water and it was significantly darker in color than the watery drink. We highly recommend Seven Glaciers Bar instead. We had the exact same drinks there and they were tons better. Thankfully, the manager apologized and reassured us that she would address the issue head on with the server. We hope so in the event we dare chance bringing people there again. She even made some recommendations to other restaurants in the area we could try insteaf. The ambiance was fun and family oriented. We paid for the appetizer and drinks and left before dinner ever made it out.",Quality,Ambiance,,

"This is a decent Petco. Normally Petco as a company has terrible reviews for how they keep the store and the animals. The fish tanks are always an issue as far as fish being alive here, which frustrates me. And the area for the ferrets is always terrible. I wish they'd take better care of the animals. But... Friendly and quiet, generally. We do enjoy bringing our dog in. Pricier than Walmart, and they carry some of the same things. They do offer some items that Cold Spot doesn't (we prefer Cold Spot for our dog), and of course if you have other pets like fish or rodents etc. this is the place to go. HOWEVER, stay away from the groomer. Our second groom had our dog half done and traumatized. One of the gals at the groomer counter is not friendly, either. Not worth even half the price we paid. We found a much better groomer. But for a pet store, it's decent, when you have limited options.",Location,Customer Service,,

"Incredible views and beautiful lodge. Winter pricing was still pricy considering nothing is included (ie no continental breakfast, only 2 servings of flavored coffee in room). Would have given more stars except for the following: not all staff followed Hotel's stated COVID mitigation policy (which was to wear masks, including for the kitchen staff where it really counts), and the live music was too loud indoors-I could hardly hear the front desk clear during check-in. Also it was very very crowded and most guests had no masks, which was disappointing to see and didn't make me feel comfortable enjoying the huge fireplace since it was so crowded. We did not get the Northern Lights alert from front desk that I tried to sign up for though we still caught them. I liked how the Northern Lights and weather forecast was posted for guests. The local music in the evening was a nice touch even if it was way over-amplified for indoors setting.",Taste,Customer Service,,

We split a garlic naan bread. The Tikka Masala had great flavor, the goat meat may have been a little tough, but overall a good choice.

Had anywhere from 1-3 high school aged personnel, with 1 of them at any given time busy with her friends and/or telling customers all the things they would not want to hear. Not limited to other persons urinating in the foam pits, or squatters residing within the establishment.
The place is starting to show where they don't clean and the foam blocks are being reduced to particulate that gathers on the proprietary socks.

When they first opened it was very different than what it has become. They had employees all over, regulating the rules and keeping order, that is no longer the case. I had some employees more caught up with me talking to my child in the child only zone but had nothing to say to the individual who was half way through the trampoline, headed under through the springs.

"Point Woronzof never disappoints. Great for short hikes, wide views of Downtown and the Inlet, and in the winter, it's one of the most southerly places in the world to walk on sea ice.

"Great value and a very interesting place. We got a room with our own bathroom and it was nice not to share. The room was small, but not cramped.

Fixtures and furniture was old, but ""unique"" so it was okay. My wife and I both woke up a few times with discomfort with the mattress, but weren't sore the next day.

I would give 4 stars, but the cleaning needs to be greatly improved! There was large debris on the floor, it wasnt vacuumed. And there was some hair on the shower wall, it wasnt wiped down.

The staff was nice and helpful, and we had no issues with our reservation through a hotel booking site.

"the first room on the first floor assigned to us, looked like it wasn't even cleaned! the floor was all dusty, the toilet was full of dirty tissue, bed was ""made"" but looked like it was slept in and the blankets were just folded back and pillows thrown on the bed. the second room on the second floor was much better, but then we were accused of climbing in and out of our window to get in and out of our room to smoke. after the employee who resided there in one of the rooms accused us, he came to our friend who wasn't staying there but there to visit us and said ""I won't say anything about the climbing in and out of your room window if you can help me out and ""hook him up"" when asked what he was talking about, all he said was ""you know"" so our friend ignored him and left. Hours later when he came back, the same employee asked him if he had got what he asked for. When our friend told him ""no"" he said that we should begin packing. Nothing ever happened of it. But to be threatened to leave the hotel we just paid for, is very unprofessional and I would never stay nor recommend anyone to stay at this disgusting ""hotel"" its more like a broke down motel!",Outdoor,Cleanliness,,

I am not able to give you a great response regarding the fairbanks animal control shelter and the main reason is that I have paid for my new puppy to get a rabies vaccine and arrange for it to be done during the day of the rabies vaccine clinic to be held at the pioneer Park area of town. I'm sorry to say that we had a emergency in the family and we weren't able to make the event at pioneer Park. When I contacted the animal control shelter and explained to them that I have the receipt for the payment of my animals vaccine and arrange to have her vaccine given later or at the convince of the shelter and I was told that I would not be able to get my money back and I will have to pay for the vaccine again if I want to get the vaccine and tag for my 🐶... They have claimed that they are a 5013c not for profit and yet they are not willing to give me the vaccine for which I have paid for...??,Taste,Event,,

"Hoping to rewrite this later, but was disappointed in the service. My husband had been by the lot and found a vehicle that he wanted me to test drive. He had talked with a salesperson prior to us returning.

When we got there we went to the vehicle we wanted to look at, sat there for a bit and no one came out. That was fine.

My husband went in and was told the salesperson he had spoken with was on the phone. He told the front receptionist that we would be waiting outside next to the vehicle when the salesperson became available.

While we waited he texted the salesperson and didn't get a reply. After approximately 30 minutes of waiting we left.

As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot the salesperson called. According to him the message about us waiting wasn't passed on to him. I had the same reason used by another salesperson when I had previously been inquiring about a vehicle on the lot.

Not sure if it's being used as an excuse or the reception isn't doing their job, either way service was lacking.",Customer Service,,None,

I start to eat and find that both the fries and the onion rings are stale. I take both back and get a fresh batch, but something was wrong with the rings. My guess is that they haven't changed the oil recently. They were so bad that I didn't eat them.",Taste,Customer Service,,

He was very expedient, and kept me updating with phone calls regarding how the job was going and when parts would arrive. He did his best to keep costs down but not skimp on quality.

"FOR TIRES INSTALLATION.

TLDR: I recommend American Tire & Co for tires over Costco. If you have a Costco Tire appointment, plan for a wait for at least 2 hours, if not longer.

Made an appointment for winter tires, special order because they weren't in stock in the store. Made an appointment for 5PM, was out of the store by 840 PM. Even if you make an appointment, plan for at least a 2 hour wait if not longer. There was a group of us in similar situations, all waiting for our tires to be put on. On a positive note, met some friendly people while waiting.

Fast forward a day after. Had a flat while going to work, the  valve stem was defective and leaking air, causing the flat. Had to put spare on, no problem. Drove to Costco at 10AM sharp, guy told me 45min ETA. No problem. Hour of shopping later, they told me it will be 15 minutes until they pull in my car and start working on it, because I was a walk in.

If you want tires, Costco is an option, but I recommend going to American Tire & Auto, which I have done before with no problems. I only went to Costco because I was going to move stateside eventually, so I thought why not. I'm giving 3 stars just because of Emmit, good guy, very helpful.",Quality,Customer Service,,

"The table seemed sticky. The wait staff had poor hygiene.  She wiped her mouth and then touched our drinks.  The service was really slow and while they apologized they offered no compensation.  I even heard the waitstaff discuss with each other how to prepare their customers for the wait after they'd been seated.  I felt the food was way over priced. I had the linguine and really thick almost chucky soup.  Limeade was heavy lime and heavy sugar and lacked refreshment.  Too bad we are staying at the park and love it.  And would have likely eaten here again, but I wont go back now.",Taste,Customer Service,,

I try to get here every time I get to Anchorage. They have always been absolutely great. The last 2 times I stopped to get my rolls they were not so good. I always get a 4 pack to go. I dont usually get to them for several hours. This last time they were very hard and stale. I couldn't even soften them up in the microwave. The sugary cinnamon was very grainy too. Perhaps I will insist on the fresh ones in the future. I have been dissuaded in the past and told that the packaged ones were fresh also. Not this time. The rolls also looked like the goofy misshapen ones that are set aside. I will try one more time...3rd times a charm.,Taste,Experience,,

"I ordered the impossible burger. The burger itself was great! I love that so many places have such a quick and easy vegan burger option now. However, the service was awful. The place was pretty dead, it was a Thursday night, I called beforehand to see if myself and two friends needed reservations and they assured us that we didn't. Regardless, it took nearly 20 minutes for our server to come by and offer us menus. We sat so long without menus or water that another waitress came over and offered to bring us drinks.
The food arrived and my gluten-free bun was moldy. I hate raising a stink at restaurants but after inspecting it under a phone flashlight, it was clear that there were fuzzy green areas on the bun. I mean, I get it. I'm gluten free and I keep all my bread in the freezer bc it goes bad so quickly. Also, I assume gluten-free buns aren't exactly flying off the shelf...
Our waitress swept the burger away, apologizing, but she came back shortly and got in an argument with us, insisting that ""the chef said it was ash off the grill and he has years of experience so I trust him over you guys"". I was flabbergasted. This woman was literally telling us the mold we saw on my food wasn't there and that somehow ash from the grill was instead on my cold, untoasted bun. It was ridiculous! They tried to tell me that they weren't going to replace it, and then they insisted that I keep the burger but they would put it on a new bun. At that point we were all just stunned. They brought a whole new plate within minutes, so I'm not sure what the whole gaslighting discussion about mold vs no mold was, but it was maybe the strangest experience I've had at a restaurant.
Regardless, none of us will ever go back to 49th State. Just awful.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Went to have lunch at Wendy's today. The manager April was running the register & taking orders. While taking our order she started to correct an employee who was cleaning the counter off of a spilled drink. She was loud and rude,talking down to an employee while dealing with us at the samend time. The while we were paying she continued to yell at the employee and when she said why aren't you responding to me ""Jamie"", he said I didn't think you were talking to me since that's not my name. She then proceeded to tell the employee what ever I want to & you will do what your told.

"It's a real old-fashioned barbershop, with 4 chairs and 4 barbers on the busy days.  For the price of a cut at a barber college you get an experienced barber to cut your hair.  Conversation is usually pretty good, ranging from duck recipes to oil prices and the local news, and old days stories about the Alyeska Pipeline getting put in.  Hours vary - however, if they have enough people to last till quittin' time, they lock the doors.  No ""Last Minute Larry's"" here!",Quality,Price,,

"Finally got a chance to try it after years of wanting to. Went during lunch time, it was busy but not too crowded. Very pleasant, clean, relaxing atmosphere. Friendly, efficient service, very nice people - family owned and operated.

Extensive menu of Vietnamese specialties, very fair and affordable pricing for Anchorage. I  hope soon to try several, especially the cold noodle salads.

Today I had the spicy chicken with cashews, which I am told is their most popular order. Boneless chicken thighs and vegetables in a delicate slightly-sweet sauce with sliced fresh jalapeños and cashew halves. Served with white rice, I found it quite delicious, and the serving for me was large enough to take half home for supper - bonus! My companions all seemed to enjoy their choices. I coveted someone's Vietnamese pork chops, another one I almost got today.

I was very happy with my first visit to Ray's and I will make it a point to come back. I highly recommend!",Taste,Customer Service,,

"The burgers and sides (fries, mozz sticks, onion rings)  are great. Have eaten here 3 times and have never gotten bad food. This is a permanently located food truck. Literally an old school bus with a wooden lean-to built on the side. Seating is on multiple picnic tables (3 exposed, 1 under cover in the lean-to). Food prep takes about 15 minutes, depending on what's ordered. Longer at busy times. The burgers come with ""fixins"": mayo, crisp lettuce, nice tomato slice and sweet pickles. They are not fancy burgers but they are very tasty: squishy sesame seed bun, well melted cheese, great flavor. Highly recommended!",Taste,Experience,,

"I was charged multiple times for the same stay. I was told I was nlt allowed topay cash, so they charged my card 5 times or more. The end result is that I have to wait 5 to 7 business days for my money to reappear in my account over an issue that the Hampton Inn employees did themselves. Ice maker on the 3rd floor was not working and leaking all over the floor. I think this could have been a great stay, but getting charged like this just ruined the whole trip, considering how expensive it was and that it wasn't my fault or my banks fault that this happened. At least a free night would have made the trip almost worth it. But the Hampton Inn employees made no effort to make up for their mistakes, while I am basically screwed til I get refunded for the multiple extra times they charged me flr the same stay.

"The last full-service station in town, that I know of. The original owners retired, the new owners are doing a fine job keeping up with the tradition. Gas prices are competitive, use your Carrs rewards. They have lane attendants who will actually pump your gas, check oil and other fluids, clean your windshield and check your tires. Propane if you need it. Full service garage, friends and I have had repairs and regular maintenance done, and we're happy. They generally get you in quick, time estimates are pretty reliable, work is good and prices are fair. Convenient location. Friendly and professional. There might be a better service station in town, but I haven't seen it.",Quality,Customer Service,,

"I have mixed feelings on this place. For the positive, I’d have to say the pedicure foot massage was beyond amazing. I would have paid just for the massage. They really work on your feet and my feet were really stressed when I went in. Also very nice staff. On the negative side, I got shellac  nails and they are chipping in day two. I also got white tips on my toes and the whole toe is chipping. If they used better product, I would have zero complaint. I can’t rationalize going back no matter how good the massage is if the product chips when it is supposed to last a week minimum.",Quality,Customer Service,,

"Horrible. I’ve tried 4 out of the 6 bays at this location, and same result every time. The wash doesn’t do anything at all. I talked to one of the on sight employees and showed them that my vehicle wasn’t even washed at all and they offered me a free wash. What good is a free wash if it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do? This is the second Alaska Laser Wash location I’v tried thinking that maybe the other location was just a poor quality facility and figured I’d give them an honest chance. I took this photo about 10 min after the wash. The only clean spots are where my hands open and close the door......LMAO

Response from the owner 9 hours ago
Keyser, I am sorry to hear that you have been having such a difficult time getting your vehicle washed. I suspect what has occurred is that you, for whatever reason, didn't get a good wash the first time you went through, but the finish products worked great - and encapsulated the dirt behind a protective layer. This happens from time to time, but not that often. The solution is to use one of the pre-scrub brushes to remove the Weather Guard and Carnauba Wax and then re-wash. I generally do this myself for my customers who come to the Lake Otis location and have this issue. If you would rather not have a brush touch your vehicle, then one or two of the $10 washes (which don't have finish products) will remove them finish allowing the dirt and grime behind the protective layers to be removed. I know this seems like a lot of work, but it isn't. Please stop by one of our locations and have an attendant help you.

Looking at the photo you posted I have to wonder how long it has been since you washed your vehicle...

Reply to the owners response:
Thanks for the response, but there are a few problems with it. I went to your wash on 4 different occasions over a 2 week period and never saw anyone “pre scrubbing”. The allure to this type of wash is the fact that it’s touchless. There are plenty of spray and wash facilities that I can go to if I wanted to use a brush. If I’m paying for an automated wash that I have to get out and pre scrub with a brush it kind of defeats the purpose. Also you apparently did not read my full review. That picture was taken no more than 10 minutes after the wash was completed.",Taste,Cleanliness,,

Then they build you customized exercises and home care programs so that you can actually work on the muscles and structures to get you back into alignment and not just rely on the adjustments. They contact your insurance and tell you from the beginning what to expect for cost. You are welcome to bring your kids which is so helpful for actually being able to keep your appointments.

"Buying the vehicle was great, once they received their money though the customer service was gone. During the sale I had mentioned that I would like to upgrade my rims from the 18"" to the 20"" rims. He said it would not be a problem and that he would see if it his boss would offer me some sort of trade in for the wheels that were currently on there. He said, if not worst case scenario he would give me his cost on the wheels. I was leaving town so I bought the vehicle and left my vehicle with them for over a week and a half to get it sorted out only for the salesmen to quit answering his phone and passing me off to someone who has no idea what im talking about or our previous discussion. Still have not got a response after over 15 attempts of trying to get in touch with the original salesmen.

"I'd give them 0 stars if I could.  I was looking for something that the app said they had 7 of in stock.  It didn't have an aisle or bay listed for it's location.  I asked 2 people, a younger gentleman and an older blonde lady.  They looked it up on their handheld scanner and then acted as if I didn't even exist.  They started wandering around i thought looking for the part but that was not the case.  2 minutes go by and they're both nowhere to be found.  Without saying a single word to me.  They vanished.  I expressed my disgust by putting all the other items I was going to purchase back and left the store. Upon leaving I saw the blonde lady helping someone else on the computer.  Not a single word did she say to me.  I will never return to this store.  I considered returning to say something to the managers, i'm willing to bet that the managers don't care which is why this behavior exists in the first place.  I've had better customer service with TSA.

We were lucky to go at the right time since the bears aren’t always as plentiful, but what a neat experience getting to get that close to these majestic creatures and not fearing for your life.

"We live out in the Alaskan Bush, with no vet for 400 miles. When our dog started peeing blood and throwing up, we sought out a recommendation from our local dog rescue who pointed us to Midnight Sun. She is a very large pup (125lbs and lanky), and hates being away from her people, so I was nervous about shipping her out without us. From the moment she arrived at Midnight Sun, they were kind and communicative. They let me know when she arrived, and the vet herself (not a vet tech or receptionist, which is often the case) called to discuss her care, asking permission prior to performing X-rays, and patiently answering my questions even though it was late in the evening.  I am also in the medical field, which I did not disclose to her doctor at that time, and I was very impressed with how through she was, and how she spoke to me. She clearly is an animal lover and not just there for the income. I believe it was Doctor Hefley that I spoke with, but I'm not positive as it was late and I was exhausted. Luna had to spend the night due to flight times, and was to fly out the following day, but an incompetent courier service resulted in a second overnight stay. At this point I was really anxious to get my pup home, and I was delighted when one of the employees, Darby, called and asked if I would like pictures of Luna to settle my mind. Obviously I said yes. She was not in a crate, but a playpen with toys, getting attention from staff (I will say, she is a pro at getting attention ;) )

In regards to the cost of treatment: Yes, it's expensive. However, $200 for an X-ray is pretty standard at a vet. Vet fees vary for an office visit, but this is an emergency vet, so just like an ER visit for people, you have to assume a higher exam cost. This is not a lot cost clinic, however in being a pet owner, one must understand that there might be an emergency.  And unlike other vets that we have been to, we were not charged for repeat x-rays that they did to ""double check"" their own work the following morning.  Being a pet owner in a place that requires a flight and a courier to get my pup to the vet, I'm grateful that a place like Midnight Sun is there to treat her with compassion.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Easily the greatest quality movie experience in Anchorage. Aesthetics, sound quality, comfortable seating, and everything else is top quality.

The only time I would prefer a different theater in Anchorage over Tikahtnu is “$5 Tuesday” at Century. If you don’t know about “$5 Tuesday”, here’s a little PSA: Tickets are $5.50 each for any movie (except pre-release showings) every Tuesday at Century. And if your cellular carrier is AT&T, you get a “Movie Twosday” deal every Tuesday (it’s a buy one get one deal)!

So Century + AT&T + Tuesday = $5.50 for 2 tickets ($2.25 each)!!!!! You’re welcome.

That being said, Tikahtnu’s regular prices are cheaper than Dimond’s, and overall a better theater than Century. So if it’s not Tuesday and/or you don’t care about saving money on a Tuesday, this theater is your best bet!

By the way, for you AT&T people out there, Movie Twosday works at any theater. So definitely use it at Tikahtnu!",Taste,Price,,

"What is with this place? Every time I eat there it is supremely disappointing. I ordered the cheeseburger, which I decided on upon seeing the first menu, then I was brought a different menu by our server which was not actually the correct menu for the event as there was a third brought after we ordered, but the cheeseburger was on the first two so that is what I had ordered. It was not however what I got. What I got was a slider, charred within an inch of its life, on a hamburger sized bun. It was sad to say the least. I really wish I had gotten the third menu before putting in my order because the dishes other people were getting looked supremely better. I couldn't help but think the kitchen was mad at us for ordering something that wasn't on that menu so they took it out on our food. Later when I wanted to order something else because unsurprisingly I was still hungry after my one slider, I could not get my server's attention. Like to the point where it started getting comical, she walked close enough I could almost touch her 5 times without a glance in my direction where I was desperately trying to get her attention. I only go to Williwaw for special events, because other than the activities all my food experiences have been so bad. Next time they have something I want to do going on I will go to eat somewhere else. I think I finally learned my lesson.",Restaurant,Variety,,

I said they can have the raw pizza back but I paid for edible food and that's what I want and only then was I told a new pizza would be sent out. They need to work on customer service at the phone center, I didn't ask for free food but simply what I paid for.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,

Lately, however, the theater has been outdoing itself and now has heated reclining seats that make movie dates 1000% more enjoyable. They've been offering more variety in the snacks as well. They also have a sort of loyalty program where you can reserve seats on their app and get 20% discount on food, which we have enjoyed a lot. Great place! We love it a lot.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Northern Tea House provides a small, pleasant atmosphere for tea in a social setting in two seating areas, one with a couch, the other with a small table setting.  It's a comfortable space with a rather large selection of teas or bubble teas.  Sometimes there are little sweets also available, depending on what's available.

After looking over their menu of multiple pages of teas, some of which are no longer available, two possibilities stood out for me to try.  Royal Chinese Milk Tea was selected, or Masala Chai.  What size, I chose the 20 oz and then selected half and half.

The place filled up with several more customers shortly before they were scheduled to close, daily 1200-1700.  I liked the taste of my milk tea, my spouse chose Turkish tea, said that it wasn't dark enough.  Turkish tea I believe is brewed very strong, very dark, where an amount is drawn, then diluted with hot water in the cup.

"Look for the Milepost 229 - .
Our Nenana River rafting guide recommended 229.  As soon as we stepped inside we knew we were in for a treat.  No more pizza and fried chicken, not here. The dining room was elegant, warm wood tones and roomy. The bar had fantastic massive wood cutting surrounding the bar.  It is a work of art.  The large glass windows allowed you view the side yard and hope to see a moose. That night, we observed what  were mostly locals coming in for dinner in groups.  So nice to walk with and feel welcomed.

We were there for 2 dinners and were impressed with the grilled halibut, cream of dill soup, a fresh blue cheese salad, and fresh salmon.  We enjoyed the Dill soup, and the halibut TWICE.  The fish was sweet, moist and tender. that's all I ask. It was a brilliant dining experience.  So glad we could come here for a quiet dinner, instead of the massive crowded noisy dining halls in Denali village.
The desserts were great but the home brewed root beer float with their home-made ice cream was the best I had in decades!  I should have ordered another one, silly me.  I won't make that mistake again.
We'll always go back to 229 when in the Alaska Interior. We have to ask Laura for her recipe for the luscious Dill Soup.",Taste,Experience,,

"Is this the best pizza around, no.
However, the staff has always been helpful to me. The pizza is pretty good, I do like their crust. And the prices are better than almost any other pizza joint.
I always order in person, and I tip. So I cannot speak to phone and internet orders. But they have never done me wrong.
Pretty hard to beat when you need a pizza.

"In October, my friend and I happened to be passengers in a friends rental. The rental was a nice 2018 Ford Fusion that was silver in color and ridiculously clean on the in and outside of the car. It was a smooth ride and quite nice. Until, I was handcuffed and separated from my property in the vehicle and brought to APD Headquarters. It was there I learned that the vehicle had been reported stolen and our friend, the driver had borrowed it from his friend to take to the mall. However, it only gets worse from here on out. Our friend's friend' actually ""borrowed"" this car from her ""friend."" In which Enterprise reported the rental stolen the same afternoon it was recovered. Before leaving the parking lot, I made sure an officer wrote down what was mine in the vehicle. After a couple hours, me and my friend(the passengers) were released and no charges were brought upon us after it was all discovered that were were simply accepting a ride to the mall. Anchorage Police released said vehicle safety back to Enterprise employees with all its contents still in the vehicle. Here is where my issue arises. My BLACK PURSE, that contained my MAKE UP bag filled with KAT VON D, TARTE, URBAN DECAY.. just to name a few, my TOSHIBA LAPTOP, my OVERNIGHT BAG, & finally my purchases from NORDSTROM RACK in their respective shopping bags, have disappeared into THIN AIR. GONE. After October 9th, I called every car rental company in Anchorage until I was able to confirm it was infact Enterprise. Once in contact with Enterprise, every single employee did not even acknowledge a rental was reported stolen. Every person I spoke to, passed me off to the next, I explained what happened, that I didn't know who the original renters name or reservation confirmation number. We were only able to find it by the case number filing. And still, phone call after phone call, no one knows where my stuff is. It was discovered that the car was brought to a location for detailing, and after a phone call with them, they confirmed that my property was not in the car when it was brought to them, confirming that it was removed when it was returned to the Airport location. I went to the Enterprise location in the airport and they did not have it behind in the office. I was then instructed to go to the National Counter. I went there, no property in the back office. The employees contacted their manager, whom was busy and couldn't go look in their locked lost and found. I was given her contact information and to go from there. After emailing numerous times, I get a response telling me that I need the original renters name to go any further. After numerous employees exchanged all the back and forth with me, this Manager says I need the name, of someone I don't even know to go further. She doesn't even bother looking for my property. Someone has my black purse, overnight bag that had my make up that is expensive mind you, my new $300 Oral B Toothbrush that I only used ONCE, my laptop that I used everyday for work, that I have since had to resign from. That was my income for me and my family. $2700 a month gone. My clothes that I just bought, and Enterprise doesn't care. Where did my belongings go? Why did no one care? I was an innocent party in this whole situation. I am so frustrated and disappointed and disgusted in the lack of humanity and the amount of trust broken. I expected my belongings to be stored safe since I was not allowed to take anything from the car. Enterprise only cares about the money they get from you and nothing else. This company should be ashamed of themselves.",Location,Price,,

"Came home from work to a hysterically upset girlfriend, who told me she was robbed at Walmart.  The scam in question is a person asking to sell their Walmart gift card for a lesser amount in cash near the entrance and customer service counter.  Scam is potentially in cahoots with customer service employee who verified the balance on gift card at customer service counter but when used at Checkout there's a $0.00 balance.  I immediately returned to store to speak with manager who took our statement and advised us to file a police report. Manager made no attempt to question customer service employee or even inquire which employee was involved. Ultimately it wasn't their problem.   Guess what's not my problem ? Finding a parking spot at Walmart because I'll never return as a customer.   Waited over a year to get a reply or some kind of corporate response from Walmart.  Received nothing ! Walmart now receives nothing from me either.   Good riddance Walmart !!!

Usually call in and get take out. It's FAST - 15 minutes is on the high side to wait.

If they advertised premium quality beef, like no-hormones/anti-biotics, etc, I would give 5 stars.

The burgers are always good. I've always slightly disliked the fries for some reason. They look like they should be good, but I find them too much on the mushy side.

"Unfortunately, I've had to visit the ER twice this month but the doctors and vet techs took such great care of my mini doxie. They took the time to answer my millions of questions and I didn't feel rushed at all.

"Went in to use a text coupon :
*Papa Murphy's: Buy Papa Murphy's Gift Card
valued @ $25.00 or more
& receieve 50% off your pizza.
Valid 12/22-12/24 *

on 12/24, first I was told ""no that coupon isn't good anymore"" then when we determined it was still active. I asked if I purchased a $25 gift card could I use it today and get 50% of my pizza paying with gift card. Was told no.

For the record I do love your pizza and am a loyal customer, but today was I felt like I was a burden and not worthy of respectful customer service.",Taste,Customer Service,,

"Ok so this is a tough review to write. I ate here just the other day and the staff was very nice and helpful in explaining the menu and the level of spiciness to expect. But.... they gave me FOOD POISONING. And I am 100% sure it was from here being that I didnt eat anything else the rest of the night. I am really sad because overall the foor was good, but I cant even think about their food now without getting nauseous. Sadly I will not be returning.",Quality,Customer Service,,
"It says horn and antlers on the sign and they definately have a good selection of those, but where this place really shines is in its minerals.

All in all 8/10 could have had more rocks :)",Quality,Variety,,

"I went there for the first time recently. The food was decent, but really over priced. The decor was beautiful and the service was amazing. If I could do 2 separate star ratings, I would give the food a 3 and the service a 5, but since I can't I met in the middle with a 4. If their prices ever get lowered I would give them another try.",Restaurant,Customer Service,,
