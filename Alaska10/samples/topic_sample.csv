7,"This was a very horrible car wash experience. I was disappointed I even went to a drive through wash. I bought the silver wash 19.00. The truck behind me also had a horrible wash. I witnessed one employee mocking behavior not prespraying around the truck instead pretend working in a mocking way. My mirror was almost pulled of drivers side and two long scratch gouges were left on paint area of mirror.
When I spoke to the other employee about my truck still being dirty the scratched and that I witnessed the mock spraying ( he was award as he was there also) no one spoke to me I had no option to say a word also they had two of us trucks so close together I couldn’t even blow dry truck.
This is a new car wash at the old duck pond location I wish they had rebuilt the do it your self  at wash stalls as I felt disrespected and ripped off.. yes I was offered to go through again ... no thank you I was afraid of more scratches.
Horrible car wash horrible!"

41,A regular home depot
42,Boat broke and we saw 3 of the 23 glaciers. They dropped us off about 1/2 mile from our car. Not a fan.
43,Thank’s Peter for the fat and plus bicycle. It is a new experience in the winter. I did not know that bike in winter it is perfect! The bike is saved in excellent conditions!
44,Newly remodeled
45,Great coffee. Nice atmosphere. Seating can be difficult to find at times.
46,"I have usually enjoyed my experiences here. One time I had a not so friendly encounter with a not so friendly manager who said their burger machine was broken and we should leave because it would take 2 hours for burgers to come out? Everyone else was getting their food, so we decided to order. We got our burgers right on time, but we felt pretty discriminated against. Every other time I have been there, I have really enjoyed it however, and will definitely go back next time I find myself down in Anchorage"

50,It's a okay place
51,Ok food but not good. Clean efficient service.
52,"I went there today to see if this place could help me out.  They were quite busy, so I preoccupied myself with browsing the store since this was my first visit.  After 20 minutes and the young man behind the counter still didn't acknowledge me in the store.  I expected more from the store since, I read some great reviews.

I am new to the area and will take my business to other local gun stores.  I would advise everyone to try this store last."
53,"Its Costco, bulk products, hot dogs and pizza"
54,"Best enchiladas in town, when I want great Mexican food, this is the only place to go"

56,"Has most normal mall stuff, parking it cheap."
57,Excellent service. Ignition was changed out and he was still able to get key for truck made. Awesome will definitely call again if needed.
58,"A lovely experience, as always! Great place for family’s and couples, and coming alone is just as fun. Staff are friendly and helpful, the building itself is clean and organized. Parking and camp grounds are nearby for RVs, which comes in handy when needed. Many exhibits are interactive which is great for children, and adults :) Over an amazing destination for anyone visiting Seward!"
59,"because NO star is not an option. They take forever, almost never get anything right and have attitudes when you tell them something was messed up. The new crew is a joke and need to be retrained ASAP! I gladly drive to Fairbanks for better service and HOT food. This location is trash."
60,"Great food. Mostly locals go there, it's like ""Cheers""."
61,"My passenger wanted coffee, I did not get any. She reported that her coffee was nice and hot, very tasty, and attractively served. We did not have to wait long in line. The server wore a mask. Competitive pricing."
62,"Hint'o'mint flavor has a great taste, fun place to chill and excellent service. Make their own cones!"
63,Went there while in the area on the recommendation of a friend. Food is overpriced and service sucked. We came in before a party of 6 who got bread and butter before us. We walked out. Will never return and will tell everyone I know not to go there.
64,"very nice, clean roo. and continental breakfast was very nice, fresh product, good coffee and well maintained buffet"

66,Great food & great service!!!!
67,This place is excellent!  My go to place in Kenai!  🤩
68,"I like it for a full shopping trip for this area, the pizza is the best for the price and bulk is often not much more than what it would be in Kenai/Soldotna."
69,"Staff were friendly, just appeared to lack motivation to be timely or serve consistent food. My wrap had little meat. My spouse could barely finish because there was so much meat in theirs."
70,"I've just taken my car in to be estimated for repair and everyone there has been very kind and a pleasure to chat with.
Will try to update once repairs are made"
71,"Nice haircut..friendly, down-to-earth earth staff. They make you feel right at home!
I learned some interesting history facts from talking with my barber while getting my hair cut. I had to pay in cash which I wasn't prepared for but it worked out."
72,"Slow, boring ride is the least of my dissatisfaction with this trip.
I especially was upset with the bait and switch of my son's ability to drive. I asked specifically on the phone if 16 with a permit can ride and was assured it would not be a problem. Our tour guide went out of her way to ask again after giving us a safety brief and came back with a no. This was the main reason we decided to do this trip.
The equipment we drove was well maintained and comfortable. The route is on public land on service roads most 2 wheel drive trucks would not have a problem driving. We went about 10 maybe 15 miles an hour.
The views are marginally better than roadside of Healy, Beth and a couple other mountains. We heard the same explanation of burlesque dancers being the source of the names of the mountains multiple times. The worst part of the trip was when Rachel from  South Carolina (?!!!???) gave us a moving 15 minute update of the poor, poor status of the local community needlessly hunting down and slaughtering predators in their dens for 10s of thousands of dollars; implying the all that profit flows to the greedy evil guides, ignoring the large majority of that income flows to the State and federal park service for maintaining the scenic views we were enjoying.

Then to a dry river bed where we had an elementary explanation of rocks that should have excited us for the 30 minute stop at this rock bed.
Wes was very professional and didn't rant about topics he knew nothing about.
As a local to Alaska that lives here year around I remember when the villages were asking for permissions to kill the predators because the wolf population was out of control and were killing sled dogs and livestock. We don't need out of state activists trying to tie our hands at protecting our property.
Save your money for this waste of your time. The same company operates the zip line and other tours that are worth the expense."
73,Great folks here and great deals!
74,"This is a picture from the gas station. Not a picture of the gas station. I do like the only gas station in town. They sell regular gas, diesel and propane. They have air pressure for tires most of the time."
75,Always stop
76,Great service and selection. Worth checking out
77,Fresh and amazing
78,"I came here with the impression it was going to a top notch restaurant. Looked nice, the server  was amazing but the food was not. Our table ordered a burger ( we were disappointed ) steak with mashed potatoes ( overly salty and I love salt) seafood pasta ( taste burnt) the only thing that is worth eating was a salad and tuna poking. I would not recommend Simon and Seaford's if your looking to be satisfied."
79,"Favorite grocery store in Wasilla Palmer area, clean, good produce, and freebies each week if you get their app :)"
80,Great
81,It's all about the money...
82,"This is one of the BEST ice cream places ever!!!! There combinations are SO UNIQUE!!!!
I got breakfast Tiffany(I could eat 5 gallons of this one!) and the honey bear! This was simply delightful and for a REALLY great price.!"
83,"Burgers, fries, you name it 😎👍!"
84,Always has what i need well stocked
85,Always a great stop when traveling the Seward highway.
86,I love their cod and their scallops.
87,Excellent
88,Can never go wrong with taco king. Good place to get a quick bite at a reasonable price.
89,"Ordered the breakfast with eggs and bacon/sausage. It was good, even though the bacon was too crisp for my preference.
Coffee was good too!"
90,Expensive but a cool place to take the kids...quite difficult with a toddler since big kids can get rowdy
91,Love this place medium rare is truly medium rare
92,Small is what it means. No wait usually and you better have a tide book. Once the tide is fully out your difficulty getting your boat out of the water is slim. A place to walk around and pole fishing. 5.00 to park for the day and believe me they do check and it goes to a 40.00 dollar fine. Best to pay the 5.00. Lots of parking and restroom available if needed
93,Largely state offices with 0 security to keep drunks out.
94,"Quality and consistanty of their signature items, ie. salmon dip, and pizza, was top notch for awhile but has dropped over the years. What was once a perfectly cooked pizza is now often burned unevenly on the crust or salmon dip is way to cold. But when you are serving a mass amount of people this becomes difficult. I'm afraid this once great restraunt is unable to keep up with it's own popularity. The staff is still very friendly, and do their best to serve you. Although this once was one of my favorite places, we now pass on it, to head somewhere else local."
95,"Always clean, happily greeted by employees and the food is always fresh and delicious."
96,Going to be crazy in the next 48 hours.  They were busy today...glad I won't have to go tomorrow or early Thursday!
97,"My wife and I camped here over Labor Day weekend in a 26ft travel trailer. It took some creative skills to get my trailer parked safely as some of the pads are short, and many of the back up angles are terrible, but it's a great escape, just outside of town. It feels like you're in the shire surrounded by beautiful greens and nature everywhere. The lake is stocked with rainbow trout and the grayling are eager to chow down on anything you cast into the lake."
98,Enjoyed this small zoo with my two year old. Great option for some local animals - including musk ox and moose.
99,Best burger I've had in years
100,Monica was a fabulous and informative dental hygienist. I really appreciated how welcomed she made me felt as well as giving me detailed explanations to all my questions.

I highly suggest them for any gathering be it church function, meetings, or for parties. Keep up they great work!"
111,"Good food.  Enjoyed group dinner w extended family. Tends to be more expensive and they usually take mandatory tip for group dinners.  Very entertaining tho, worth it."
112,"This place is great. Got there late but in line before 10pm so they took my order, great start. I talk fast and there was a mistake made in what I said, Josh fixed it, no questions asked. I see why this place is so busy, good food and great service!"
113,Quick and delicious grab and go for when you're not into cooking
114,"Kimchi French Onion Soup? With waffle crouton?? Wow! Five stars alone for the original idea, plus excellent execution. The banh mi sandwich also extremely tasty and original. Sure, it's an unusually interesting, artsy space, and the staff might be inexperienced in some ways but they are sincere and genuine. You will enjoy your visit!"
115,"Friendly employees with quick service, food is always on point and as expected. They also offer a military discount."
116,"Very nice, attractive, and clean store. Lighting is very good; aisles are easy to navigate.  Have great selection of goods. Parking is adequate to the store size.  Service is friendly and while I don't use it there is self scan. I prefer the personal touch so go through lanes with service reps/cashier"

130,"This was pretty fun, sadly I can't swim too well."
131,Very informative you are able to view many aquatic birds and animals you don't normally get close to.
132,Not a mall more like a closet
133,They messed up my order . Had to drive all the way back but they fixed it and apologized.
134,I was unaware of the fact that I was forced to leave.... The rude waitress asked me 3 times in 5 min if I was ready to order while I was still looking at the menu.... After we placed the order she gave herself a 15% tip on the credit card... I myself work for for tips I would have never tipped her that amount because of her rude attitude.. never coneing here again... Tips are earned not a given
135,Wonderful food and well worth the drive.
136,It Awesome.
137,Great little shop.  They have it all.  Pretty good sporting goods selection as well.

153,"Great food selections and alcohol.
Needs expansion.
Very packed,10 bar 2 2 seater 5 4 seater and 1 6 seater tables. We sat at 6 seater and it was made of almost cardboard. Couldnt place your forearms onto table.
Bathrooms are always busy and packed. Seeing opposite sex using both of bathrooms and creating even longer lines.

Again food and service is amazing !"
154,"Good food,  good people"
155,"Ok... so how does this work?  This place transferred hands a ways back and was purchased (to my understanding) by some our friends from south of the boarder. I was hesitant to return fearing an influence that is just too common here in Anchorage and I’m my humble opinion the same things just prepared differently and then renamed.  But to my wonderful surprise these guys are pulling of some great American style food. I’ve eaten many items from the menu and have been pleased or even ecstatic about what I received. Now I’m not comparing this with Club Paris or Crows Nest, but if you are looking for some great home style cooking you have to give this little place a shot. It is just another example of the hidden gems we have here in Anchorage tucked away in strip malls. ( Think Jens or Campabellas). Keep up the good work."
156,Excellent steaks great atmosphere
157,Service & Food was great
158,Delicious!
159,Great deals

168,Every order in the last few months has had somthing wrong with it . Waiting over 40 min for wrong food orders is not ok I have spoken to management and they dont seem to care
169,Very fun and different than anything else I've done. Guy operating it is very happy with the place and himself. Kinda comical.
170,"Local bar with a great atmosphere, bartender was friendly and funny, love the dollar bills pinned up all over the walls, would defenitley reccomend this place."
171,Went to our corporations Christmas dinner here and had a wonderful time. I do think we needed a bigger space but that was poor planning on the corporations part. It seemed like a nice enough place for a smaller group than what we had.
172,Because I keep it nice and clean to the fullest!!
173,Amazing..

177,Awesome
178,"Had a great time and the food was good. The server was definitely working that evening with a smile and was very personable.

I definitely will eat there again while enjoying a beer."
179,Delicious!
180,Wonderful place to see the wildlife of Alaska I love the bear feedings and the walk just fun and perfect for your little ones

187,Nice camp grounds.
188,Some decent food in a decent hotel. Great break fast.
189,"My first time here during the mandates by the mayor banning indoor dining. The food was reasonably good.  However we were ordered ground beef in our salad and received shredded which included an upcharge.  We also were not informed that using a credit card would result in a credit card fee. Although not unreasonable at 3% (standard rate charged by credit card companies to the business) this is the only place we had encountered the charge and there were no signs or information regarding this charge provided before or during our meal.  We only knew about it at the end of our meal when we saw it listed on the receipt.  While we want to help out local businesses trying to stay alive through all this, correct orders and full cost disclosures are important as well."
190,Great advice for cleaning my cream colored leather jacket! Thanks guys for the help!
191,"Smallish, but really well done and great for kids."
192,Very clean
193,"Love this park! Great place to go for a hike; if you dont want to drive out of Anchorage! Beautiful views! If your a traveler  out of town, I highly suggest checking this park out! It's not far from the airport. About a 10 minute drive depending on traffic."
194,"My locksmith was timely, professional and even set the locks to match the keys again.

I called after hours because a young kiddo had locked everyone out of the house and was inside, unsupervised. It was a huge relief when I called and Northstars associate recognized the urgency. He had us back in the house in just minutes."

207,Fantastic!!!
208,Clean busy mon and tues
209,"This place rocks. Awesome pizza, nachos, tacos and other food. Epic craft beers from Broken Tooth. Movie selection varies, but we've seen some great local movies and documentaries. Wish they had fewer popular movies which have poor ratings. But tickets are cheap, beer is cold, and food is tasty. A great option for a rest or rainy day in Anchorage."
210,The best Philly cheese steak in Anchorage!
211,It's a solid place. Not too pricey and very good quality.
212,They store my liquor
213,This place is totally bizarre. Big but empty. Really bright lights. Weird art. Food was pretty good tho.
214,Good for parts
215,"Usually this place is really good, sometimes it is a little disappointing.  The Deadliest Catch is great, but their hashes, pancakes, everything is good.  Sometimes it just feels like they are having an off day and your crab/salmon cakes dry.  Definitely a bit too expensive for the quality of food you get, and it seems over hyped... make sure to make a reservation."
216,Yummy! Best banana splits ever
217,"Competitive prices, Great selection, knowledgeable staff --- what else do you need..."

228,"When a guy ran out of here furious because he wasn’t seated immediately and he wanted the veal parmigiana - I knew this was the dish I needed to order! It must be good especially considering he slammed and kicked not one; but two doors! It was amazing! Perfectly crumbled and covered with delicious sauce and smooth cheese! The service was lovely and despite a Pizza Hut style exterior, the interior is cosy and warm!"
229,"Usually okay, but didn't have the new Samsung 20 5G Ultra screen protector or the regular Samsung 20 5G either!  Had to go to a  different kiosk."

240,"It has been many years since I've gotten an eye exam. I made an appointment for an eye exam, which they did, but also did a retinal scam...I mean scan. I had to pay extra for it, even though I didn't want it. And because of that you can keep your ""computer glasses"" you were trying to sell me. First and last time for me and Kenai Vision."

249,"Worst experience EVER.  Hardly communicated, waited for a MONTH for my car to get fixed (front struts replaced).  $1500 later  Left with a new bend in the frame.  Noone knows what happened.  *I* must have been in an accident.  No I was not.  No proof.  NEVER EVER go there.  EVER."
250,Great views. Can be a bit overrun with kids on weekends.
251,Breakfast sandwich is off the charts
252,Great place to visit and learn about Alaska and the culture of the people.
253,"Every now and then, I like to go get coffee...glad my bro Mike put me on. 😎"
254,Such good pizza. Cozy little place. HIGHLY recommend
255,OMG delicious!
256,"When I am in the mood for deep fried chicken and mashed potatoes, I will go to KFC or if I have to get a haircut, I go to Academy of Hair Design"
257,Decent fast food slightly over priced but good.
258,Freddie is good
259,"I visited the Anchorage Library, not the park."
260,"Wonderfully prepared food, great price and excellent service. 10/10 will eat here again. Very homey, personal, home town experience. Food selection is simple and delicious. I couldn't have asked for more. 👌"
261,"The best food, awesome staff, affordable"
262,Love theme park great history. Great place for gatherings
263,Nice
264,cheap stuff
265,A great place to get gas and snacks when driving between Anchorage and either Valdez or Canada.
266,Clean friendly play place was pretty nice
267,"As advertised!! I used the mobile app and ordered ahead. The pizza was fresh, made to order and ready when I arrived."
268,This place is one of the best in town
269,This place was raved about.  I have eaten here three times now tried three different dishes and have been disappointed three times.  I will say the service here is much better than anywhere else in North Pole.
270,Great  flight
271,Fantastic savory crepes! A must stop in Homer.
272,Best Buy
273,Good food and drinks.  Dont recommend the grits
274,"My all time favorite coffee and bfast sandwich pit stop after a long flight home. Sunrise jalapeño chedder bagel, sausage, extra egg, and extra cheese bfast bagel. Double toasted. Best 6$ spent everytime✅✅✅✅✅✅"
275,"There for you when you need them, they are extremely caring and kind people. But they also have a good mind set for when decisions get tough."
276,"I love to start off with the house Margarita when I get here, it's so good and makes you feel good lol. The food is really good here and I usually finish everything on my plate. I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food, but they get it right here for the most part. I would go here weekly if you're a Mexican food fan....."
277,Love this place
278,I like their food.
279,"They have all the supplies for your hunting/fishing/camping/hiking and all the like, needs. Prices are a little higher than I'd like on things like clothing, but everything else is pretty average. So glad Fairbanks has sportsmans. There are not a lot of stores like it in the area."
280,Super great every time go!
281,Incredible place to visit.
282,They had all of the supplies that my friend needed for a special order.
283,Great to stop for ice cream and coffee
284,Great runway
285,Loved it
286,"Just a typical exchange. Everything you would expect mostly. I have had trouble finding help at the BX or knowledgeable answers or expertise, more then anywhere else I have been. The barber shop is terrible I think I only had one lady listen to me with the 5 haircuts I got. Each time the back of my head was messed up, high fade, med fade, and low fade mean the same thing, and  I have to repeat myself multiple times because of the language barrier. Don't take your children there, that was hard to watch. On a positive note the shops outside are usually pretty cool."
287,"Best dohnuts in the state ( in my travels, best in the union)

A lot of Costco products broken up and repriced. Very useful.

Decent produce at arm and a leg prices.

Good little hardware section to save you that long drive to Fairbanks to finish a project.

Free coffee, and decent attitudes and customer service. Even compared to other three bear locations such as Healy , this one does things the best!"
288,Great food great drinks awesome place not bad pricing for the great food n service.
289,"Everything you need to find under one roof. The food court is a good place for a cheep good meal for lunch while you shop. They now have a qiosk system in the food to prepay for your order, so convenient."
290,Nice place
291,Great staff. Clean facilities.
292,Good selection
293,"Not really much to see here,always dirty too"
294,Great prices.
295,My steak dinner was awesome my hubby had  sandwich .he liked it also place was clean servers and owner very friendly will be returning
296,"I love the taxes toast and the dip
I don't eat meat but my little sister like the chicken"
297,"Good service,  mediocre food."
298,The price is crazy.
299,Being locked out of your house during a winter in Alaska can be scary on top of being cold. Able's staff were at my home in no time flat. The gentleman who came was very professional. Thank you!!
300,"Drips is a nice little coffee hut about 2 miles south of the knotty shop in North Pole. Overall this is a quant little place to stop for a coffee, smoothie or something to eat.
Personally I think the food is better than the coffee, but none of it is bad. Service is always good, but Ravens Brew coffee is not a good coffee IMO. The food is tasty and on Fridays stop by for their brisket.
Little pricier than most coffee shops, but it's in the middle of no where and last place for a decent cup of coffee for 15 miles to North Pole and 75 miles before Delta Junction. But food is worth the stop either way."
301,"Great service, very efficient and friendly and very knowledgeable.  I would recommend to anyone. They fixed my galaxy watch in 1 day with no issues. Thanks."
302,Excellent
303,I can almost save a lot from here
304,Best sushi in Anchorage!!
305,"always great food and atmosphere. although courteous and helpful, staff was not very perky. I highly recommend the prime rib."
306,Nice  for small.kids
307,Service was outstanding.  Food was great.
308,A lot of things
309,"F F Friendly, all important Alaskan Amber 😜"
310,"(Translated by Google) Nice activity in Fairbanks. It takes 2 hours. Some explanations on the pipeline which crosses Alaska from North to South. You can see a stretch when you arrive. Covered little train ride but no windows so in rainy weather, it is better to equip yourself. A musician plays some country tunes with his guitar and his violin, it s very nice to be patient before everyone climbs up (many buses when we are gone). A pioneer-like bearded man tells us the story of the region's gold diggers and the techniques for recovering gold. Then it's up to us to try the adventure! It s cheerful and everyone leaves with their little bundle of gold sequins. We can then have it weighed. Souvenir shops well stocked. Free coffee, tea, water and delicious cookies !!!

(Original)
Sympathique activité à Fairbanks. Il faut compter 2h. Quelques explications sur le pipeline qui traverse l Alaska du Nord au Sud.   On peut voir un tronçon quand on arrive. Trajet en petit train couvert mais pas de fenêtres donc par temps pluvieux, mieux vaut bien s équiper. Un musicien joue quelques airs de country avec sa guitare et son violon,  c est très agréable pour patienter avant la montée de tout le monde (de nombreux cars quand nous sommes allés). Un barbu genre pionnier nous raconte l histoire des chercheurs d'or de la région  et les techniques pour récupérer l'or. C est ensuite à nous de tenter l aventure! C est gaie et chacun repart avec son petit paquet de paillettes d or. On peut le faire peser ensuite. Boutiques de souvenirs bien fournies. Café, thé, eau et délicieux cookies gratuits!!!"
311,Gravel parking lot. Had issues with spots assigned. Had to get wife involved to talk to owner. Finally got it taken care of. Part of Best Western and I don't think they want anything to do with RV park. Not managed very well.
312,"Ordered a Steak Sandwich $14.95, upgraded to a ceasar salad for an extra charge, bread was non-plus, Salmon Chowder cup $6.95 tasted good, but very little salmon, the cup wasn't an actual 8 ounces, it was a little over 4 ounces, a misrepresentation of size and makes this a poor value.  Service was lacking, we were forgotten, not attended to once the food was served."
313,Disappointed there is no microwave or refrigerator in the room. Just opened so lots of projects going on and a lot of trainees learning.
314,Kids enjoy it.
315,Lots of trails to enjoy yourself. I hiked 1.5 hours in for a total of 3 hours and saw nobody.
316,"Solo. Nicely done. Best full sized cinemaplex in town.... Ok,  the ONLY one in town. Still, well kept and standard pricing (hey, it's Regal) so save up a bit extra for any snacks. I just don't do the popcorn thing.  :)  Price of a show these days is my only complaint. Had a great time."
317,Pretty decent bar with a kitchen. Standard bar fair.  I would recommend the super tots if you have the munchies.
318,"I go here for litter and cat toys. There is a type of pink chenille mouse toy that only of kitties adores, no one else has it."
319,"The staff has always been pleasant. High priced, though."
320,Best coffe in dowtown. Great lunch spot
321,Love Big Ray's
322,Beautifull
323,Crispy hashbrowns and crab cake benedict!
324,Good parking good places to eat around this mall
325,"Great place, AMAZING food."
326,Beautiful
327,Love the new store
328,Nice to place to go with my kids
329,"The food is fabulous!  If they can get it locally grown or raised, they do.  And I love that.  I drive all the way from Anchorage just to eat at Turkey Red!"
330,"Helpful staff; huge selection. Store is clean, well-lit, and well laid out in terms of finding what you're looking for. Prices are competitive; in fact, many things are a better price than in the big-box stores."
331,Thanks for all the help Tammy!! You made it easy forus!!
332,Awesome food and even better service!
333,"food is great, service was fair, 2 guys running it can't keep up the pace when busy most of the time..wi-Fi poor. good coffee, when you get it, just don't be in a hurry."
334,"Been here before and food and service was great,  today,  only one server and not to friendly."
335,Very beautiful I think everyone In anchorage should see this place
336,Clean and friendly cashiers
337,The right place to fill the tackle box!
338,"Great burger and drinks. The special cocktail ""witches brew"" was fabulous."
339,"Good food, reasonable prices!"
340,Nice selection with a fireplace and chalk art board
341,Yes .. this place is very amazing.
342,"We've had nothing but issues with Loving companions since I adopted a cat from there. This cat only weighed 5 lbs and was about dead when I bought her. Turns out she was starving to death and needed surgery to fix the issue. Donna denied anything was wrong with her, claiming they had her a month and she ate just fine. After a long phone battle, they begrudgingly paid for her surgery. 2 weeks later and this cat is still sick and miserable. After 3 vet visits, we're looking At putting her down because her quality of life is seriously lacking. Don't adopt from here until the animals get better care! I've heard lots of horror stories since I've gotten this cat from Pet Pride, animal control, and the vet clinic about sick animals being adopted from here."
343,My dog loves the pig ears!
344,"The beer selection is good, but the good can be hit or miss. Everyone says their pizza is great, but it's always left me disappointed (except for the Thai Pizza, that one is good)."
345,"They have wonderful veggie and vegan options, plus lots of choices for the carnivore. Always busy and a table is a difficult item to score when it's busy"
346,Great food but customer service could use some help
347,Awesome friendly service staffs.
348,Food was just awesome and the service was warm and homely. Thouroughly enjoyed the experience of a hearty lunch
349,"Nice things like guns and cases , holsters cleaning stuff and more great service"
350,"We did the walk on the wild side tour and it was definitely worth the price, even though the weather was pretty bad. It was ice all morning and then rain the rest of the time, but our guide Brandy was great and took time to make sure we were safe on the ice. We got to feed a few animals and get pretty close to others. There weren't many people there, so it was nice to be able to just hang with the animals and not have too many people around while we toured. At the end, we got to howl with the wolves and all 4 of them started howling. It was amazing to hear. Would definitely recommend it! Great that there were also 2 different bathroom areas (not outhouses haha) and the gift shop was nice. PLEASE don't go here and taunt the animals. Go here in peace and to observe them. Also, don't try to touch or feed them unless you are supervised by a guide. We did the special tour, so that's why you see us doing that. Respect how amazing these creatures are."
351,Best place to go for a macchiato
352,"Great ice cream, & coffee..."
353,It's obvious ownership has given up on reinventing in this business.
354,"This location was not as good as I expected. Staff were not very friendly, coffee was okay."
355,Nice atmosphere coupled with good food and service makes this a special place to eat and enjoy the Fairbanks area.
356,Cool place
357,Always a great experience. Love stopping by for all my nerd needs!
358,Love the store nice and convenient but please don't ask me 5 times while I'm looking around if I need help . I know it's your job and you probably get told to ask but its annoying
359,"Great spot for lunch...really nice, helpful, caring staff."
360,Can't wait to see after the renovation
361,"I came here because of a very trustworthy recommendation, I have come to regret this decision and have learned from my mistakes, I hope may you as well.

Almost a full month to find out I was lied to directly. Almost a full month to hear from the lenders that I had been approved under their modified terms.
Almost a full month later, now aware of this, I go back to the dealership and to my face I'm told:

""I wasn't involved, what do you want me to do.""

What. In. The. ""Heck.""

I don't know what happened to this once fantastic dealer, but there are a plethora of options to be treated like garbage in the valley and Anchorage area with at least a better deal. Its almost like the other options are intrested in, well, doing honest business.

If this is what should be expected coming here? Save your time and money for a business that is actually intrested in selling you a quality vehicle instead of this  sad sinking ship."
362,Has most everything you need for your home repairs
363,"My favorite Head Shop in the Valley. They have the best selection of Dime Bag cases of all sizes, duffle bags, messenger bags, and backpacks I have ever seen, also unique apparels, and a great selection of glass ranging from decent quality that's super affordable to very high end art pieces. The staff is always great, but if I might add my only criticism, it's the sub-par selection of incense. I know, I'm probably the only person buying that here, or anywhere for that matter, because all of their sticks on display are old, dry, and.have lost most of their scent. Hippies need their patchouli, man!"
364,The best tofu ever!! The last time I can say I’ve had excellent tofu was in Guam.. this was absolutely amazing!! I ordered a stir fry tofu while my husband ordered spicy pork bugolgi and pan fried dumplings. We will definitely be ordering from here again!!
365,Love myself some Target
366,I'm not a fan of their customer service. Selection is limited. Access is not worth the effort.
367,"I stayed at Sophie's Station. The rooms were nice, the hotel is aged and out-dated. However, please don't let that deter you from staying at Sophie's Station. During the summer they have a free tour bus (Old school bus) that takes you around Fairbanks."
368,Great prices!
369,"(Translated by Google) Very good!

(Original)
Sehr Gut!"
370,"How many times will I review the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints?

As many as I'd like.

How many times will I review it with 5 stars?

Every time.

How often will I praise this Church, it's truthfulness, and the fulness of the restored doctrine of Christ which it possesses?

All day every day.

How many words can I fit into this paragraph to get it to the needed amount of characters to be considered ""detailed""?

Come on, I'm just trying to not smack the keyboard to fit a bunch of random ""sjdboeidkf"" in there, you know?"
371,Good food!
372,"Philly cheesesteak (made keto by removing the bun and no cheese sauce, just regular cheese) Was amazing!  Best I've ever had!!!!"
373,Best food and awesome staff. Thank you.
374,My pups love it.
375,"Family owned business. great selection of games, consoles and vintage gaming! love this place"
376,Slow service around noon
377,Excellent chicken marsala and most excellent tiramasu! Friendly waiter and bartender....
378,Usually good help...not always as with any large store
379,"I like how they have lower prices for cash compared to the other two gas stations ""in"" town."
380,"Very busy, but the computer guys were super helpful, listened attentively, offered several viable options and helped expedite my purchases! I was not disappointed, and will go back to buy future computer products and laptops."
381,"(Translated by Google) I came after cleaning the car comfortably.

(Original)
맘편히 자동차를 닦고 왔습니다."
382,A beautiful peaceful place to just relax & unwind.
383,Wholesale outlet. Prices are MUCH better than the big stores due to selling close-dated items.  Example: Need coffee? Peet's Coffee at 50% off the Fred Meyer regular price! And the best part: Alaskan-owned small business!!
384,Great sushi. Great price. My kids love the edemame white rice and mochi ice cream! Long menu sonething for everyone. Very limited alcohol menu. Small bar. Quaint restaurant. Always a breif wait cuz it's so good!
385,They had my part in stock
386,Good ice cream
387,Great cider!!!!!!! What else is there to say? Oh cranberry cider!
388,Professional People and they are Awesomely Friendly! Thank you Dr. Andrea Frangiosa and to the rest of the OPA Team keep up the good work!
389,Cute kids boots
390,Craig the store manager was great.  Spent a lot of time with us discussing dog food.  We felt our business was appreciated. Highly recommend shopping there.
391,"Usually the cheapest without having to jump thru some sort of points ""rewards"" game.  Just sucks they don't do the windshield cleaner any more nor paper towels at the pump so I could check my oil levels.   Also who doesn't put garbage cans at the pumps!  Yeah other then that costco as a whole is a great company at the less. just little stupid stuff like stated above just basic gas station standards."
392,German fare local eatery
393,Super smoothies.
394,Great people. Had some problems with the heater we rented. They let us trade it out and then they let us use another free of charge. Excellent customer service
395,Royal Thai has an outstanding Curries!  This is one of my favorite places for lunch.  The staff is friendly too.
396,its OK barbecue their sides could be better.
397,Lots of different kinds of food to choose from.
398,"Great view and fabulous day to visit the park! Would highly recommend coming in early May - beat the rush, and you can actually drive up where they usually only allow tour buses. Only downside is the main Visitor Center isn't open yet, but a side one is, and that isn't really why you came, was it?"
399,Everything that is needed for safety gear
400,Mmmmm
401,"Love this great Grocery, I always have a gift from its owner every time I did my shopping here."
402,"Love the atmosphere her and the weed, ya know? There's good deals running through here and they have a point system set up. Like getting my cartiges here but they've been getting a lil more pricy compared to some others places around here. The service here is phenomenal though 🖤"
403,Great espresso!
404,"Good food, high prices, and long wait times."
405,"The crew has always helped me when needed. I have yet to have a bad experience here, and we will continue to take out business here and well as promot them when I can.  Thanks!!"
406,Great products 🤑 little pricier but not unreasonable. Has all the right rain gear for my son. The star rain suit for recess the hiking back pack carrier is amazing thank you NAO😁 and wonderful staff always so friendly too
407,"Absolutely delicious. It's a small place, with a center bakery cabinet and shelves with goods, and seating for about 25. Very clean. Nice tablecloths and napkins. An upscale bistro feel. The menu is locally sourced as much as possible, with organic and minimally processed ingredients. There was a good selection of food; this week it happened to be burgers and salads with an incredible drink menu of coffee, chocolate, and chai-like items. The food flavor combinations were very interesting, we had  roasted brussel sprouts with spicy peanut sauce on a beet-wheat bun and it was DELICIOUS! I also had a kefir and wild blueberry smoothie, also great. Service was wonderful. Owner is the chef and is quite friendly. More expensive than your average restaurant, this is not a Red Robin or Outback Steakhouse place, and would not be a good substitute for people looking for that sort of experience. It is approptiately priced. Not really a kid-friendly place, or geared towards kids. Saw no high chairs, etc. Fine dining. Since there is only the one chef, on busy days could be some waiting time."
408,Very beautiful park that is clean and quiet. Well maintained
409,Always a good experience here.
410,The store front has good customer service and attentive sales associates. The hero's behind the scenes (installers) are great also. Kind and helpful.
411,"Regular fries are nothing to write home about but they've got these double cheeseburger 2.99 deals that are pretty awesome considering how big and tasty the burgers are. Criss cut fries as always are delicious, a must have for any Carl's jr. Visit and, if meat isn't your thing they've also got the beyond meat burger! I cant think of another fast food place in Alaska that provides such an option. The line took kind of long to get thru, but it was friday night so I would put more weight into that being the reason, when we got to the window they had all of our food ready to go. It'd be kind of nice if they had a portable payment so they could send someone out to the cars in line, to pay, and then take the food to them as soon as it's done."
412,Great place to walk. Nice trail that goes around the entire lake.
413,Lots to look at!  Purchased a Fenix TK20R tactical rechargable flashlight. Sales person was very knowledgeable of stock on hand. Good job.
414,"Food is GOOD, price resonable, atmosphere comfortable."
415,A little piece of the wild in town
416,"Century 16 is my favorite theater to go to. This theater is where my husband and I came right after our wedding in 2010 (in full wedding attire). The majority of my date nights with my hubby are here, girls night, family time, etc. I am addicted to their super nachos, paired with an Icee and popcorn. My family and I have plenty of beautiful memories here."
417,Great flights
418,"Service usually slow. Drive through is slow. The food is your typical McD food. The best part is the $1 drinks. Its now Alaska State Fair time, so they have more people on duty which makes it better. And now the drive through is open 24 hours."
419,This place is a great place to take you're family to.
420,It's a McDonald's.
421,Fast good drinks affordable
422,"Texas Roadhouse was great, and super nice waitress."
423,I've been going here for years and love it. I've sent many friends and my husband here as well. Everyone is so nice and good at making you feel comfortable. 10/10 would reccomend!
424,Quaint shopping village enjoyed shopping in the stores
425,Food is great and employees are very nice
426,Guys always helpful
427,They've been open during the entire pandemic and has been a staple for us when we crave fast food. The staff is nice and seems to care that our food is made right.
428,"Employees working hard during this pandemic and the Christmas season.. Lines are a little long, but that's to be expected during this time of year."
429,Super cute. The best park to take your kids to. Always an icecream truck too.
430,Did the Harding Icefield hike starting from the visitor center around d second week of July. Strongly recommend to do it on a clear day as the views of the vast Icefield may not be fully seen on a cloudy/foggy day.
431,By far the best shakes in town. Will definitely be back week after week for a shake. Consistent quality and they get you out the door pretty quick.
432,I love the wings but they are a little pricey.
433,beautiful breathtaking scenery.
434,"I would give 5 stars for the delicious food, but prices have steadily increased for the last few years, and are now quite high. Delivery service is nice. Lunch buffet is a good way to try something you wouldn't normally order."
435,Good place to start your day.
436,Quick and excellent service and I love leaving with such a clean car!
437,They help with any medical reasons. Large or a the tiniest problem. They take care of you 25 hrs a day 8 days a week. Appreciate all they do. Wish I could help them in a return favor. They are the silenced soldiers. Much respect and honor to all. Love you all
438,Why do they hire people who don't seem capable of providing any customer service at all? Or does management train them to be incredibly rude to the customers?
439,"Pretty average considering the price.

The rooms are spacious but the amenities sparse, and no view in most. The window AC was just powerful enough to cool the rooms in July. The quality of the room furnishings was average. Housekeeping was intrusive, they would knock and enter immediately, without announcing.

The breakfast, if purchased with the room, is not a buffet. Instead, a voucher is given which can be used to get an entree from a limited menu.

On the plus side, the staff was friendly, the location was good, the view of the lake from behind the hotel was amazing. The seaplanes were fun to watch, but they did make a lot of noise in the morning."
440,I told the there’s a hair on the pickle ginger. They didn’t change it out. They just put more ginger to cover it!
441,Oldest camp on the slope
442,Good coffee!
443,They got all the stuffs! Much good service!
444,I was experiencing pain from a pinched nerve in my lower back and Dr. Mike was able to fix it. Highly recommend his chiropractic work.
445,I come to Kava's often and really enjoy it. The food is great and so are the prices. Keep it up Kava's!
446,Wasn't bad. Wasn't great
447,Love it all
448,"Once again, I needed something one of a kind for a specific occasion, and once again they did not let me down!  Alaskan made and perfect for what I was looking for!"
449,Great service and patience for taking of customer.
450,"What a gem of a place! Great service and the food is super!  A fresh take on classic fare. Waffles instead of biscuits, and the biscuits and gravy are really good. A little spicy heat in the gravy, and raindeer meat!  Chicken and waffles are great too, loved the breading on the chicken strips."
451,Excellent Sunday brunch!!!  Gor sure will visit more in the future.
452,Has just about everything that a Walmart should have
453,The new brewery in town has great beers. I wish his system was a bit bigger so we could enjoy the flavors more
454,Love it
455,Very friendly place great fun
456,"How was Walmart?   Cheap,  but not enough registers open,  just like every other one on planet Earth."
457,Awesome
458,Great place to mozy year round^.^
459,Good food
460,Best burgers in town
461,Food was good. Service a little slow. Little confusing with the buffet
462,"(Translated by Google) Great tasty food that is prepared quickly. On our first visit we were completely satisfied with everything.

However, on our second visit the service was not that good. Despite not even half full restaurant. The dishes of guests who had long since left stood around on the tables and the drinks ordered were not brought. If you had wishes, you had to go ahead and express them yourself, as nobody came to the table. The people in the kitchen and at the reception also acted like schoolchildren and kept making strange noises and talking to themselves. It doesn't have to be in front of the guests! The need for improvement in the service team would be very good.

Despite everything, the food was good and freshly prepared. We also found it good that there was free access to WiFi.

(Original)
Tolles leckeres Essen, was schnell zubereitet wird. Bei unserem ersten Besuch waren wir voll zufrieden mit allem.

Bei unserem zweiten Besuch allerdings war der Service nicht so gut. Trotz nicht mal halb vollen Restaurant. Das Geschirr von längst gegangen Gästen stand ewig auf den Tischen rum und die bestellten Getränke wurden nicht gebracht. Wenn man Wünsche hatte, musste man selber vor gehen und diese äußern, da niemand zum Tisch kam. Auch die Leute in der Küche und an der Annahme benahmen sich wie Schulkinder und machten ständig komische Geräusche und Fachsen unter sich. Das muss nicht sein, vor den Gästen! Verbesserungbedarf beim Serviceteam wäre ganz gut.

Trotz allem war das Essen gut und frisch zubereitet. Gut fanden wir auch, dass es dort einen kostenlosen Zugang zum WLAN gab."
463,"Spectacular dome express. What an amazing views and serivce. Deposit itself is well maintained, they have restrooms, she'd and seating available on platform. It is located just beside visitor center. Walkable distance. Dome express was amazing, open train with great host and staff. Alcohol gets served on Express train , they also have clean restrooms on train. Fine dining is provided with delicious menu on train. You have to pay for that. Healthy options are available, also desserts are great. Prices of food and drinks are really reasonable. Staff is amazing, constantly smiling , very courteous and provide great hospitality. Views from this train are scintillating."
464,"What a beautiful place! It's kinda tucked away at one of Juneau, but once you find it, it's worth the drive. The church is extremely pretty and the surrounding area is gorgeous.

You do not need to be religious to come here. It sits right off of the bay and you can see the surrounding mountains. I was lucky enough to see several Orca Pods swim by while I was there. It is a great place to visit."
465,Always busy not enough cashier's....
466,Decent food. Service was just OK.
467,Beautiful hotel and setting staffed by nice people.
468,Nice view
469,Well just about the best verity of different meals to choose from in healy
470,My Family Loves the Food And The Atmosphere Here... One of Our Favorite Places to Party 🎉
471,"Absolutely perfect....here's why:  my wife broke her jaw a few weeks ago and she was feeling better so we went for a drive to Talkeetna.  She still can't chew yet, so we were hoping for a good soup, but also wondered if they would mash up something that's already on the menu, so that she wouldn't have to chew it very much.  Oh man...the reindeer sausage meatloaf!  The chef smashed it up, put the gravy on it, then put some nice creamy mashed potatoes on the side, with more gravy.  We paired that with a lovely assortment of micro-boozes and had a great meal.

I had the pulled pork sammich.....it changed my life.  I now enjoy coleslaw thanks to them.  The sweet potatoes fries are the best i have ever had.

I will continue to support this great restaurant/brewery and I suggest you take the trip out there at least once a year.

Slow down brown might be my favorite beer from them.  Or the slugger.  Or the chuli, or the fall harvest. Or the berry and wheat."
472,Awesome
473,"The portions are much bigger than I expected, everything tasted delicious, and I loved that they brought my toddler out a little bowl of rice soup. Had a nice atmosphere and great service."
474,Very yummy food. Service is fast and friendly!
475,Lots of gear
476,"Great cuts, clean, professional, friendly service"
477,"HUGE chef's salad!  Delectable halibut sandwich.  All VERY FRESH and flavorful.  I can't confirm, but with how fresh the ingredients were, I'd suspect they are working with local greenhouses.  The chef and the entire staff definitely know what they are doing.  The only hiccup was with the hostess that wasn't able to give us a wait time (which turned out to be 5 minutes).
I would highly recommend and I would definitely go back to explore the menu some more!"
478,Foods not bad... love when they have any toes of deals with any clothing store. Great hangout place with friends if you’re not busy with anything.
479,"You people had me on hold for 25 minutes, hung up on me, and now I have to call back just to wait for someone to answer for what, another 25 minutes? First of all, there’s absolutely no reason anyone should be waiting nearly half an hour just to speak to someone. Second, if you geniuses hang up on someone don’t you think YOU SHOULD CALL THEM BACK?! Seriously, how is this a way to run a pharmacy? So unprofessional and absolutely unnecessary. You should all be replaced."
480,"Simple, easy"
481,High quality aquarium for educating and diverting the family for the day. The views of the mountains are also quite nice.
482,Usually I get cat food and crickets. I'm in & out in 7 to 10 minutes. Sundays are always busy. Never a bad experience.
483,Good example of the chain. Friendly service with an accurate inventory and layout within the app. Can tend to get cluttered easily with carts and the like.
484,"Very cute boutique, lots of cool things"
485,"Great experience, great warranties."
486,"If you enjoy an old fashioned family run diner with great food specials and the best pie in Alaska you need to eat here. Don't come in the door expecting everything to be delivered to you in minutes, this is a place to come and relax. Sit up front at the counter for daily discussions on trucks, politics and everything aero and automotive. Kick back in the dining room with family and friends, or bring a party to the upstairs party room. We always buy pies from here for the holidays, Nancy (the owner) makes all of their baked goods by hand, and will make just about any custom pie you could ask for, and many of them in sugar free!"
487,Quaint shopping village enjoyed shopping in the stores
488,Best place in town to get xtratuf boots and rain gear.
489,"Had the Philly Cheese Steak and Bean with Bacon soup. Soup was wonderful, sandwich was okay."
490,"12 bucks for a Patty melt, fries and a drink.  Behold their Patty melt in pics below.  Ate half the sandwich, went for the second half and noticed it was lacking.  They're selling 2-3 oz patties for the cost of an actual real burger."
491,Many interesting fish. Seals and sea lions we're impressive. Staff was friendly and taught us about octopodes
492,Good chicken enchiladas.
493,Wow. Walked in for appointment. Checked in on the electronic kiosk. Was called immediately. Served efficiently and friendlyly. Never had anywhere close to such a positive dmv experience ever before anywhere.
494,The staff were friendly and very helpful.
495,Really enjoyed it.
496,I enjoy it every time. A great relaxed environment. Not the average gym.
497,They are the most unfriendly & slowest state workers in the planet.
498,Awesome service.
499,Amazing inside and out
500,Fantastic food and amazing pies
501,"Visited for boxing and garage sale, so far.  Nice place."

505,My dog loves it here
506,Great beer selection!
507,Probably the most expensive and worst chicken wings I've had in Anchorage.
508,Super yummy
509,"Amazing. Great service, very clean, very professional, and did a great job with lashes!"
510,A great store
511,"Best steak in town. The filet is unbeatable in close second is the New York, followed by the baseball cut sirloin. For the price and size, I'd say the New York here is always a better bet than the rib eye. Also, try the cajun stuffed mushrooms. They're on the heavy side, but honestly incredible."
512,So amazing. God is the best artist ever
513,Nothing fancy......just good food at an afordable (Alaskan) prices.....
514,Has a nice hill used to have picnics on it.
515,Best cars in Anchorage

517,not going back anytime soon.  even if they are open late.  unclean facility
518,Beautiful park. Close to busses.
519,take the drive in or ride the bus. epic beauty
520,Good found what I needed and then left
521,Bar food
522,"Usually, I would have to always wait for tenders or potatoes to be dropped. My meals would consist of atleast one order of extra crispy tenders, but they NEVER ask me if I want any sauce or initiate to ask. They are pretty stingy too, if you do ask for some. It's not like I don't have any at home, but when it comes to those customer who are going to work and their work has none, what are they to dip it in? I'd like to give them my business, but I'd start reconsidering driving the extra mile & go to Popeyes instead."
523,"Hot, fresh, and friendly staff"
524,"Alaska Ammo is now my favorite gun shop in Alaska. I have an old Savage Model 99 in 250 Savage that I haven't fired since 2011 when I moved to Alaska because I couldn't find it anywhere. Thanks to Alaska Ammo, I can use  my grandfather's old rifle  They're selection and availability of ammo beats the big box stores by a mile!"
525,"We just had desert, but it was fantastic !"
526,Always great
527,"This place is a dental unicorn. I've never met nicer, more authentic folks. They genuinely care, and while I had some major work done, it was pretty painless. We are fortunate to have them in Anchorage."
528,Great place if its your kind of crowd good beer good pool
529,"We've had no so great experiences eating in, however for some reason take out is fine🤷‍♀️
Anyways our take out is always hot and fresh and ready when they say it will be. Hopefully it's just temporary, but I don't care for the baby carrots they've been using. I prefer the cut ones they had before. LOVE their blue cheese! 🤤"
530,"Excellent Staff, Service and Facility. Been a customer Since 2000"
531,A nice treat to pick up on the way to the airport.. and travel with.
532,We have had our dog groomed here for years. They always do a good job.
533,"Natural Pantry has long been one of the best, if not THE best health food store in Alaska."
534,"Always busy but their cashiers are friendly, just wish there were more people out on the floor or have the ones that are out there be more helpful"
535,Will was great!  He took a lot of time to educate us about guitars and the various makes and models.  He even tuned up a guitar and gave us a wonderful demo.  We will definately be back!
536,Beautiful
537,"I came here like 6 months ago.  place was busy thought food was good at the time,  till later that night when all 4 of us got sick, bad.  will not go back just because of that."
538,Great selection of shoes.
539,I like their expert advice on running equipment especially shoes and sports bras. I appreciate that you support Team in Training.
540,Great stuff. Expensive.
541,Quick an easy.
542,Great pizza
543,Sorta messy right now as they are remodeling. ...still great place to shop!
544,everything
545,"The girl behind the counter was very sweet, and they had a wide selection which made it easy ro find what I was looking for."
546,Food was good but the service and time you get your food was horrible.
547,Gci has always been good to work with for myself and my friends.
548,I like the service...they treat me with respect here!
549,Such restaurant!  Very wow!
550,Best burger in town love this place
551,Delicious dinner! Real hot plate served!
552,Always good to stop in there see old friends talk to new ones fill up with gas smoke a fatty get back on the road going
553,You better look like you belong in a BMW to get  service here. It felt like they would rather see a person in a suit and tie or no one at all.
554,"Bill is a great server and comedian, he loves what he does and it shows"
555,"Friendly, fast, good food and drinks"
556,"Pizza was great. Service was a little slow, possibly new. We had to ask for several things that should have been automatically brought out."
557,Great pizza and great staff. We had our daughter's birthday there. Went great. Staff was as awesome to work with.
558,Best place to buy honey
559,"They have way to many staff. You can't walk 10 ft without an employee interrupting you. They need to back off a little and gives the customer a chance to look around.if they need help with something they can find a employee and ask for help. I'm the type of person who takes there time in a store, I like to look around. It's annoying when they keep harassing you asking if I need help finding anything or do I have any questions for them. I just want to shop."
560,Great Family eats
561,They did a great fast and accurate buyers inspection.
562,super friendly!
563,Good store with good prices.
564,"Nice park, for all ages,"
565,Good eats and friendly service !
566,LOVE this place. My pup always has the best time.
567,They are awesome. My daughter had fun. Great experience!
568,"The lobby is often dirty but the customer service is good, as well as the food."
569,Yummy!
570,Great facility modern and very well done.  Gotta go here if u a in Fairbanks. Located right in the center of town.
571,Really enjoy this restaurant.  Good prices and delicious food. Always a good spot for the family. Also try one of their tasty shakes they are uber delicious.
572,Very good food. Great Thai iced tea. Make sure you have them turn the heat off on the food when it is hot. It will become unbearable if you don't.
573,Awesome place to visit
574,Learn about Fairbanks and it’s local people. It is free!
575,Snow Paradise!
576,Food was ok. Worth trying but won't be back. Nothing special.
577,Cant dine in
578,Nice place 2 meet 4 meetings
579,I love this theater. Seats are heated and we're able to sit comfortably reclined. Also one doesn't feel crowded here.
580,Super fun way to spend a Friday night! Lots of thoughts was put into the escape room! Highly recommend!
581,Just a lousy mall nowadays
582,If they had signs that tell what is in that area or like a map of the store it would make a better quicker shop.
583,Always beautiful & always changing
584,I love all the girls (and guy) that work there!
585,"Helped me with what I was looking for, professional and friendly."
586,Awesome location and nice staff
587,"To bissy enjoying the good food to get any pictures. They had pecan pie today among the deserts. My fried chicken tasted a little like broccoli, but that could just be because I had my piece of broccoli n cheese to close to my fried chicken. There was precabobbed strawberries, marshmellows, n rice Krispy squares so the food would be less likely to lost in the chocolate fountain. The service was great it was nice seeing a server that has been there pretty much since they opened there he is real nice."
588,"Delicious food, wonderful service, and relaxing atmosphere! My favorite restaurant in Palmer! Two thumbs up!"
589,This is the second time we have been here. The first time we dined in and it was excellent! This time we got our order to go. None of the food tasted fresh and there were items wrong in the order. Definitely not worth the price.
590,"Great show space and service. Food was okay, nothing amazing but decent. Loved the atmosphere in the general eating area as well. Worth checking out!"
591,Won't go there or any in Fairbanks. Staff is under trained. And the place is not restaurant clean.
592,"Great selection, deals on liquor."
593,Very helpful able to help me right then and there thanks Trisha!
594,Fishing for silvers at the fishing hole in homer Alaska.  Fun place to take the family spend a day fishing and dinner or lunch all in one place
595,"Outstanding customer service. This is also the place to shop if you have food allergies, alot of the products have very clear invreingre lists. The only downside is the confusing layout of the store."
596,Quick easy and cheap
597,The new lunch menu knocks it out of the park. Initially I think they had some trouble figuring out what they wanted to be but I think they really nailed it down. Midnight sun brewing came in and if you havent checked them out then you're missing out.
598,They have good Chinese meat such as sweet and sour chicken and Kung Pow chicken but when I had the fried rice it was stale.
599,Good southern dog. Freindly staff.
600,Great I got my hair cut exactly how I wanted it. I'll ve going back there.
601,"*Edit*  Went back again... Had a chicken sandwich, it was pretty okay.  The fries are still good.  If they can improve the service and the decor, it might be a cool place to hang out.

*Original review*
Service is terrible, beer selection is poor, the menu looks good and interesting, but the actual food isn't that great.   The fries are very good, the Mac and cheese so-so.  I was served a burger that was completely raw save for a thin sear on the outside.  The atmosphere is not good."
602,Awesome
603,Fantastic food and great atmosphere!
604,"The food was awesome! I love over easy eggs and they cooked them perfectly, the bacon was thick and delicious and my waffel was crispy and fluffy. My husband had chicken fried steak and hashbrowns and both were cooked wonderfully. Our service was awesome too!"
605,"Nice staff and good layout. However, lack of outlets to plug in your electronics and short timed internet makes the Alaska coffee roasting company a less than ideal place to study and work."
606,"Staff was polite and helpful, Doctor was great.!! Im very happy with my experiences so far."
607,"This place doesn't have much going for it aside from the food court, although with its recent renovations, there may be hope in it yet."
608,Amazing views
609,Great place for outdoor activities. Unfortunately hiking trail entrance is not dog poof-proof. Hiking trails are quite a bit windproof! Going to Blueberry Knoll and climbing Government peak in the winter lots of fun with refreshing all the safety skills. I go there few times in a week!
610,Got off stop and go traffic on the glen highway to stretch and take a break. Pretty nice spot with a river and frolf course. Really clean and not a lot of peopke around. Would of been better if we had a disc to play.
611,👍
612,"(Translated by Google) yummmm ......

yummmm......"
613,Great staff knew what I needed and where it was. 10/10 would recommend.
614,I love Alaska
615,"Called because dryer in car wash is broke. The response I received from the owner is unacceptable. ""We are a car wash not a car Dryer"". Do yourself a favor and don't go here. Waste of $16!"
616,"Breakfast was good ,good prices"
617,Fantastic service and delicious subs! We love how allergy friendly they are!
618,They have a good selection of different grocery items . The food they serve is really good. I just went for the first time a couple weeks ago.  I have been back for lunch four times since then. I highly recommend it.
619,Very interesting and friendly staff
620,"Great food good service, good atmosphere, best breakfast around"
621,Really good food kinda divey looking
622,"Best place in Willow to get great food from breakfast to supper, the staff and owner Tony are very accommodating plus you can get Peggy's famous pie. If your smowmachining the Willow area this is a great location to base from."
623,Awesome donuts! Lots of options! I mixed up 2 dozen. I recommend the jelly filled rolled with sugar and blueberry cake!
624,"Didn't have everything I needed, the cut saw was out of order, and I had to go to a second location, lack of quality help!"
625,GREAT pastry wonderful employees  !!!
626,Spendy. Subway with lousy bread choices.
627,"As far as tattoo spots in Fairbanks this is probably the cleanest shop in town. It's not like other spots that are dark and look kind of creepy -
It's bright and full of art work. There's such an up beat atmosphere and everyone is friendly and welcoming. I had Scotty do a piece on my arm and he helped me build from one image to a piece of art with smooth lines and perfect shadowing. The artists actually care about what you want and want to help take one picture and bring it to life on your body. I would recommend them for anyone looking for a comfortable shop to get some ink and I'll definitely be going back."
628,Best Doughnuts In Alaska!!!
629,Great service and the baristas pretty much pull the best shot in all of Anchorage. Worth skipping the drive throughs and sometumes ling lines.
630,"Great place to hike. I took my kids there (17, 9, 7, 4) they had a great time. I will say the 7 adn 4 year olds did struggle. We were unable to complete the trail. But if I just had my 9 year old we would be able to have finished the trail with no problem."
631,There seem to be a lot of associates standing around complaining about work related items.
632,"Fun trip for the family, you get to take your time in the car or on foot looking at animals."
633,Cool old dive tavern....cool bartenders and good prices.
634,Always an enjoyable experience. The staff are all helpful and know the store well. Its a breeze finding what you need and getting assistance when you need it.
635,hard to get booked these days
636,Always the best produce!
637,No long wait times!
638,Beautiful scenery
639,This store has a huge selection of asian foods and ingredients so far since they recently did an expansion. The prices for their meats are good and produce is reasonably priced too. The area is still a little shady but the on site security try to keep things smooth. I really wish the parking lot lighting would be LED so you can see better in the dark but all in all it's a great place to get your Asian foods or ingredients.
640,"I like this place. Ive been there in off peak hours and the service is great. The floor layout is a center bar stool area with tables around the perimeter, each with 4 chairs. A neutral observation: ambient music is a little random ranging from classic rock to waltz. The #5 sushi is good. The pork bulgogi is good to although a little oily."
641,"Service staff were extremely nice, friendly and helpful"
642,Fries weren't fresh.
643,It has everything you need for your weed smoking pleasure!!!😜
644,Amazing breakfast spot.
645,"Typical diner. Typical diner food.
I love diners. I love diner food."
646,Love this place
647,We come for a nice date at the museum which is free the first Friday of the month. Food is pretty good and atmosphere is nice.
648,Cool souvenir shop! Prices were decent. I like candy shop atmosphere.
649,NICE place
650,Pretty good collection in a very small place with no entrance fee.
651,"Many great shops to visit. Ok, restaurants to eat at. Kitchen store is the best!"
652,Great place
653,All the items ya need to
654,Awesome Thai/Vietnamese food!
655,"Our waiter was super nice and consistently checked in on our meal despite the fact that he was clearly busy. The food was wonderful! I'm never disappointed when I go to this particular Village Inn, or any Village in for that matter!"
656,Always great
657,Best coffee in Anchorage
658,My favorite store!
659,"Went there with a few girlfriends for a couple of drinks after work.  Food was great, place was clean, drinks were great.  The bartender was very friendly and our food came pretty quickly.  We're going to throw a party there in a few weeks and they have been the easiest to set up with in town.  No room rental fee, just let them know roughly how many, come in and buy what we you want."
660,"That was full of promise, with a decent beer selection and surprisingly good collard greens, but the pork ribs looked like they'd been boiled against their will, the ends hadn't pulled away, no sign of a smoke ring, and taste and texture were both all-around letdowns."
661,It's Walmart what do you expect.
662,"OMG if you want bread to melt  in your mouth and send your taste buds flying into high heaven, then this is not the place lol, but it certainly comes close!"
663,The pizza had no flavor. Such a disappointment.
664,Went to the DMV was quick and efficient
665,The whopper here is quite American!
666,"Always a highlight on the Fur Rondy schedule the Snow Sculpture competition is great fun. Going at night the night before judging is even more fun because the lights against the dark backdrop contour the designs so well. I spoke with a few of the carvers and they all commented on what a great time they have conceptualizing their themes and plans and the executing them in the week before judging. Steve encouraged us to sign up next year, as registration is open to anyone who wants to give it a try. The group from the Best Buddies Club said that they are friends who have come together each year, for over 16 years, to brave the cold and sculpt together. Division One Winner’s compete on Team Alaska at the US Nationals, so the artists go all out. There is also a People’s Choice Award...so stop by to vote!

March 7, 2021: Wonderful sculptures again this year. They are taking COVID precautions, so it is a great outdoor activity to take part in. They are open through today so get out there and take a look."
667,Very tasty halibut tacos. I recommend getting three because they aren't filling otherwise.
668,Very accessible
669,Well maintained. Hard to get a spot sometimes.
670,Great seats
671,Great food!
672,"Great atmosphere, really interesting art and decor. Our food took a bit to hit the table, but it was worth the wait- definitely try the Hi-Five-O.

Only gripe is that soft drinks are $3.50, which is almost into gouging territory for me.  Stick with water and save a ton on your bill."
673,They gave me and my family mor than we needed. May the Lord Bless them.
674,Best place for Christmas shopping!
675,"(Translated by Google) Suitable

Convient"
676,Good service and great produce and meat.
677,"Such an amazing place run by amazing people with an amazing team of volunteers. Bread line does an incredible service to our community, stop in to ask questions, get a hot meal, or volunteer!"
678,Although it is fast the customer service (drive thru) in this location is bad. They always miss to put the sides or forget about extras. Also the person at the drive thru seems rude most of the times.
679,"Are you kidding me? This place is awesome! To be honest Indian food isn't my top choice, but the lady loves it and I thought I would do a pick-up order. To my surprise this place is wonderful! Placed order and was ready for pick-up in 20 minutes. Especially right now it's great to help local businesses. Price wasn't even that bad, for what we got!

Chicken Tikka Masala with Cheese Naan you can't go wrong!

Will be back again!"
680,Books and board games!!
681,They are always helpful and friendly. This is the second bed we have bought here and this time had it delivered. Everyone from the salespeople to the delivery people were amazing
682,"My husband and I dine Here about once every two weeks, there dinner selection is very diverse, each dish is delicious, the drinks are just as refreshing. Staff are helpful, courteous & efficient. Environment is romantic and also if you have a  large party, they can accommodate you as well."
683,Great park in the middle of town right on the river. Lots of space for activities.
684,"Cheap haircut, from the learnings."
685,"Something different, but priced too high for what it is."
686,"Beers are great, good higher-end bar food. Great place to see live music"
687,Seats do not recline
688,"Bad service, cold food"
689,I love this store. Always clean and staff is always courteous and friendly. Easy access from the Glenn.
690,The whole sign on the building don't even working when you walk in there and you look like you're not a suit and tie guy from some business out out of Russia or China they treat you like you're getting ready to ask them for some credit and they don't want to really deal with you until you pull out a credit card that shines better than needing this hotel sucks never stay there go to the Cook he'll go to the machine before you stay here I would
691,For the price it dont match the meal. To high.
692,"Update: this new policy of closing the box office windows and forcing folks into the concession lines to buy tickets slows everything to a crawl. I understand the need to drive concession sales, but I've almost turned around and left because of the time sink."
693,Beautiful area a must see!
694,"If you haven't tried it, do it"
695,Great selection of entrees. Ok on price. Nobody's prefect. Will come again.
696,"If your serious about your relationship. Michael's will provide you with the insight, knowledge and assistance to display your love, to your significant other. After your purchase they will clean your jewelry so it's always in ""amazement"" mode.
Friendliest, personal, one on one jeweler exclusively Anchorage, AK."
697,"Every time I bring my dogs here, Julie, Olivia, and Samantha, greet with smiles. We are on a first name basis with each member of the staff. Chantelle seems to consistently be our technician. She loves my boys and knows how to lovingly, yet sternly, handle my dogs. We are also a giant fans of Dr. Sara McPeck. She is kind, highly educated, and gives it to you straight.
We truly love everyone there, it just keeps working out that we see these particular people, time and time again."
698,Smoke alarm kept going off. Couldn't leave the room because I had to keep my fingers in my ears becsuse the alarm was way too loud. Staff was friendly and very helpful.
699,"Great food, homey feel, very friendly staff. Good interior decorating with comedic wooden signs all over. Food selection is diverse and everyone in my group kicked out plates clean. Would return in a heartbeat."
700,I've had a delicious gluten-free Burger.
701,"Shorter lines than the other shoppettes, but the beer selection is lacking compared to tgose shoppettes as well."

715,"I love this Arctic office! I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends and family. Dr. Lisa is the best physical therapist in ALASKA! She has helped provide me with awesome exercises, rehab instructions and the DRY NEEDLING is incredible for knees and low back pain. I was recommend to this office by a friend and I had no idea that they were located all over the state. I was ever able to have massage therapy to help treat the sore muscle in my legs and back."

721,"Love this place, will be back next year in the RV"
722,"Service is terrible. Only one waitress who is working take-out while customers sit at their tables waiting to order, for their food and to get their checks to leave.  Seriously understaffed. Update: 1 hour and 15 minute and still no food. 10 minute later food served.  Food is good, and only Thai in Seward.  Would order to go next time if I cant talk my son into somewhere else."
723,Best breakfast in town.  We have been coming here for at least 15 years.  Can't Think Of Any Other Place That We Would Like To Eat BREAKFAST more.  Laurie is the best.  We are all family here.
724,Good food
725,"The whole parking area is basically by the Pacific Ocean or known as the coastline. For me, it wasn't that good of an experience"
726,This place is amazing!!
727,I saw other shoppers here. A shocking thing to hear but people still use malls in 2019.
728,Good store easy to find most of what you need.
729,"The food was delicious, we ate during a rare lunch opening after exploring the seasonal market they do on whistle hill. The waitress was so nice and brought our baby clean toys she could play with while we ate. It's a nice restaurant with a good vibe. I'll definitely be visiting again!"

750,Not much of a menu. Cam get chicken strips anywhere
751,"Fast, delicious."

753,Ok place for parts
754,Typical collection of tourist stuff. Nothing better or worse than all the other shops where the cruise ships dock.

776,"The Grinch Omelet was perfect a week ago. Today, Dec 4th about 1030 a.m. it was lacking enough barbecue sauce and fixed with way too much peppers. I like spicy but I also want to taste the flavors of the rest of the ingredients. The first omelet was just perfect for this."
777,"Havnt had any issues with customer service, make sure u pay them to install so your stuffs under warranty."
778,"This place was a perfect pick for my trip to Denali. The beds were soft and comfortable.  The rooms were cozy and well planned. I was in the ""cottonwood"" building as there are several buildings that house guests. Be prepared to walk but know that they do have shuttles. Music in the p m around outdoor fire rings under the stars, and maybe a s'more or a beverage and dinner and you are set! Dont forget to mingle!"

780,Pretty nice for a Walmart

802,Good place door your outdoor recreation needs. There's a giraffe mount too!
803,Just bought a 2015 Silverado at this lot yesterday. Our salesman was Matt. Every car buying experience should be like it was at Affordable Used Cars. It wasn't a big fancy lot so I was hesitant. I always go to a car lot knowing exactly what I want and it's frustrating having a commissioned salesman trying to get me to by what is best for him. No need to worry about that at this lot. There's no pressure just cruise the lot decide what you want and let them know. Their prices are more than fair and they gave me fair trade in value for my car. Matt was very professional and honest.  After I decided what truck I wanted I was out the door in about an hour. The only complaint I had about the whole experience was the fuel gauge was on empty. Not a deal breaker just always had dealerships give me a full tank. I will recommended this car lot to anyone who is looking for a great deal on a great vehicle.
804,Awesome sub sandwiches
805,Great food at a great price
806,Love their pizza! Just wish they would deliver to all of kenai.
807,No eggs Benedict? Really?
808,Grandma's cupboard.

816,"Has a covered area, grills, a large grassy field, sand volleyball court and a swimming area that had a lifeguard--all in a beautiful woodsy surrounding. I thought it was great!"
817,A newer place for sure. Their pizza is great. Get the strawberry and bacon one. Trust me. Also their BLT is the 2nd best I've ever had next to that of the Yellow Rose. Calamari is fantastic also.
818,Great walking service
819,They have some of the best sandwiches there
820,Ok but they've got NEXT TO NO Halloween decorations.

831,"***Update - download the Wal-Mart app and use the Savings catcher feature on your purchases. You have to scan the receipt within a week with your phone or it won't be valid. Good luck shoppers!***

Reasonable prices, certainly a one stop shop  for most basic groceries, some home and auto components.

They have a decent size fishing, hunting and gun section. Along with bikes and work out equipment as well.

Service here is fair to great depending kn time of day of course."

838,The follow up care after every visit is fantastic.
839,"Awesome collection of stones, gems and friendly staff!"

843,Great choice for everybody...
844,Overpriced... Tourist trap
845,Great burgers

847,Great service. Like their coffee and love the ice cream cones!
848,My neighborhood go- to convenience store. If they don't have it you don't need it.

857,"Service is spotty.  Obviously, it is expensive, but you could cook it yourself if you wanted to.  KFC gravy is amazing."
858,"never will shop with them again,  poor customer service,  actually had to wait to ask a question,  while the cashier finished her personal chitchat with a friend,  then once asked if they had any coffee beans,  3 bins were empty, she says mgr was gone , isn't there some other you could get instead.  sorry , I want my coffee that I like . bye-bye iga."

861,Always awesome and my frIends by name now.
862,"It's fine, meat was a bit dry, but the sides were good. Service was a bit slow. Just fine"
863,I like getting in and getting stuff done. . The staff is very professional and nice. . I sent my brother there first and he had n't seen a dentist in a decade. But he felt comfortable with this team.. So far I have nothing but rave reviews for dental arts..  I suggest you try them out!!..
864,"Margaritas are blended not frozen but very good, fair price $6 for a regular. I got the Shrimp Tacos for $15. Serving size is tiny!! Over priced! Then, on top of that I did not realize there is a $3 charge extra for rice and beans. Would not reorder. Excellent supreme nachos but again for $12 small serving size. For same price has a platter of Supreme Nachos 3x's larger. The combination plates are full of food! Would definitely reorder. Great Spinach enchiladas, steak tacos, and chimichaga.  Waitress extremely friendly and  offers great service. Our bill for three people was $75. One was our 11 year old. Too expensive to be regulars.  Favorite part the margarita..."
865,Very good sushi!
866,"Was on a tour bus coming back from Denali, made a potty stop here. Toilets were far better than most of this type. Quite clean and not too smelly. Didn't actually see the Veterans Memorial though. Time constraint due to being part of the tourist herd on the bus.LOL"

874,Very rude and lazy employees that are working on the night shift not accommodating to the customer nor did it appeared that he was even interested in my business or anyone else for that matter
875,I drive three hours to come to this place. They do the best dipping nails. People are nice and Tom is the person that I prefer. He always does a great job.
876,Great prices!
877,"Probably the best selection of meats at a reasonable price that we could find during our visit. And they have delicious house made spreads, summer sausage, landjagger, etc."
878,Nothing really to say
879,"Some competition for that other place, but more commercial"
880,"Great Staff. Was referred and am pleased to say if you're looking for educational information and quality of service these folks are what you're looking for.

889,Does not worth hours drive from Anchorage
890,Best budtenders in town.
891,"So many things to review here. Breakfast is great. Be sure to show up early or make reservations.

I did just eat in the cafe side, with soups, salads, and sandwiches. The avocado melt was awesome. I got the half with half tabouleh salad, and loved both. But I wished I had more avocado melt to eat. Great bread and pepper jack cheese. So I highly recommend trying the cafe side. First time and definitely not my last."

928,"Love the small town feel and often times local staff makes me feel right at home, great variety and options for all your stoner needs and desires. Informative in the know guys always know the nitty gritty. Always large variety of deals for flower and pre rolls. I would suggest a mix and match multi pack but they might already have that theres almost that much selection. Also has fairly nice reward program for merchandise and future cannabis purchases."
929,"Great photo opportunity for Beluga Whales!

Worth setting up a tripod... wait for high tide!

Great views and scenery photos... turn around, from the inlet, and look for mountain sheep on the cliffs too!"

938,Thank you Lowe's for this
939,Best coffee and service in the valley. My #1 choice
940,Great spot if you’re going to explore Denali! We saw lots of rabbits and birds! There’s not much food or shopping around and the nearby restaurants and grocery store are pretty expensive.
941,"The moment i walked in they wrongly profiled me and followed me trying so hard to be inconspicuos they just looked ridiculously pathetic. I do NOT steal and have always spent a decent amount whenever i shop here.... rude and humiliating for nothing. Never again will i hand my money to a company with as judgemental , rude employees!"
942,"Sooo good. By far my favorite sushi restaurant that I've been to in Alaska. Great atmosphere very friendly staff, beautiful presentation, and delicious food. Would recommend this place for sure."

945,Great place!

952,Cool.
953,"Wonderful food, wonderful service! As we were leaving we saw our sweet and kind waitress telling an older male native to be sure to let her know when he was there. He was hungry and she gave him a meal and then  asked him if he wanted a milkshake later. So heartwarming to see."
954,"Extremely slow, however they provide excellent customer service"
955,The only music shop that I know of in the valley.  Prices can be steep but they are good people.
956,One of the better restaurants in Anchorage! Fantastic beer and food! Highly recommend this place!

960,Join the legion and have an incredible steak dinner on Friday nights
961,"Careful if you have allergies to cod. Order Californian roll for my wife. The menu never states that there is imitation crab in the roll. If you aren't aware imitation crab is not crab at all. Imitation crab is made from cod. My son is severely allergic to crab. My son had never tried sushi before. My wife and I not knowing that there was imitation crab in the roll let our son have some. Minutes after his throat started to swell shut. When we asked the waitress about the roll, she nonchalantly said that there was imitation crab like we should have known. Because we didn't have a epi pen with us we got up in the middle of the meal in a rush to get in the car and get home to our epi pen. The Korean gentleman, who I take was the owner insisted that I pay before I leave. He acted like it wasn't a big deal and took his time processing or bill. When I mentioned that his restaurant poisoned our son he acted as if it was my fault for not knowing that there was imitation crab in the roll.
Just in case you are wondering Ichiban on Tudor road does not use imitation crab. There crab is real. There menu also states where items do have potential allergies.
Back to Haru. I feel we should not have had to pay the bill at the very least. We also never received an apology, only them telling us we should have known."
962,"Good people to work with. The type of people who will tell you what's best for you, even if it means not using their service. Thumbs up."
963,"Batteryplus screen repair is a good deal, if you schedule your appointment online. I got my iPhone SE screen replaced for 80 bucks."

971,.Must say . This place is great . Extremely friendly staff and the atmosphere is great . Have been here 6 times . Good place to ha e friends over for breakfast or any other meal .
972,"From the reviews I've read, seems like people don't understand, this is a 24 hour >emergency< vet... If you bring your pet here, without an appointment, you're going to wait... The first time I came here (years ago), I sat in the lobby, patiently, for 6 1/2 hours (it wasn't an emergency & I was happy to do so for the health of my pet, altho it was probably uncomfortable for him) recently I brought my cat here, waited in the parking lot for about 4 1/2 hours, after being updated that an emergency had showed up & my wait was going to be longer. Unfortunately he was diagnosed with carcinoma. Two weeks later he passed away, in my arms, at home. I called to ask them what to do, after it happened & they said I could bring him in & they could take care of him (I did end up taking him directly to the cremation place tho). Despite everyone there being over worked, tired, & probably sad having to deal with stress & death & crazy pet people (myself included) they have always been empathetic & patient with me. Yesterday I got a simpathy card, signed by all the staff for my boy. This place is 5 star, idc what anyone else says!"
973,"Great experience, I loved it. Everything expected from a cinema. Food, good service. The seats recline and have 3 heating settings (off, low, high). Movie shows great, Just the perfect movie experience. Hope this helps"
974,Absolutely clean food and yummy
975,Best Alaskan library!!
976,Ok
977,Enjoyed the movie despite the challenges we have today...  They keep the theater very clean and the assigned seating they provide take the guidelines we have today seriously.  I have no reservations about taking my loved ones to this theater.
978,Great breakfast
979,"(Translated by Google) Best hotel nearby

The ski resort facilities are excellent.
The pool was open until midnight and it was warm, so it was great to swim with your child.
There are several restaurants in the hotel, but it was expensive. It is also recommended to walk down the town or by car.

근처 호텔중 최고

스키리조트라 시설이 뛰어나네요
수영장은 자정까지 운영하고 따듯해서 아이랑 같이 수영하기 좋았어요.설경도 멋있네요
호텔내 식당이 여러개있긴한데 비싸긴 하더라구요. 마을쪽으로 걸어 내려가거나 차량으로 이동해 식사하는것도 추천해요."
980,Great service but it's to pricey for the amount of food you get.
981,Very good customer service.
982,"The ribeye was ok, not a lot of flavor.  Wait staff was the best part, friendly and attentive."
983,"Great food, clean fonished remodeling.  Open for business"
984,"My wife and I stopped mid day for a brew and some food.  They were serving brunch, and was very very good.  I had the eggs benedict and my wife had the biscuits and gravy.  Both as stated before were very good.  We ending up having some friendly chat and the server showed us their dinner menu.  We decided to come back for dinner, and glad we did.  We split some clam chowder and two entrees.  One was the braised pork shank, and the other was the roast. We also had an appetizer of the sea scallops.  The meals that we had were over the top, perfect size and infused with different flavors.  I will highly recommend anyone going to Fairbanks to take the 15 minute drive to the Silver Gulch and have a meal you will not be disappointed.  Cheers to our waiter Jamie and chef Robin can't wait to come and enjoy again."
985,"Right next to the dock, nice!"
986,"Greasy spoon, but great biscuits!"
987,"Maybe it's the Covid but here is my experience:
Arrive 1110am
Appointment at 1130am
Quoted vehicle would be done by 3pm
Arrive at 430pm vehicle not completed
Didn't leave shop until 510pm
(For a oil change)

Why did I schedule a appointment

However, Dawn in service was pleasant to work with.

-------
Update October 26

Do not go... Bad bad service do not care about you as a customer.

Another terrible waste of time.
Will not be back."
988,Kids would love this place and probably stay in it all day
989,You always deal with the lack of help and cashiers
990,Like the all you can eat soup and salad.
991,"In and out, bill supplies and regular, we love 3 Bears!"
992,"Fast service, great food"
993,"Great food and excellent, friendly service. The manager makes it a point to visit every table and ask how everyone is doing."
994,Great Fun place to go swimming
995,"It would be GREAT, except for the folks that think they have to run their generators all night."
996,Everytime we turned around we were in the Chugach National Forest. It was always just beautiful!
997,Amazing food and the staff is incredibly nice
998,Pretty views.  Good location.
999,"Work is always done on time, and the staff is super friendly!"
1000,Great park for my family. The community has free lunches for the kids during the summer. You're more than welcome to go swimming. During the winter they also have ice skating.
1001,"A lively place with tour office, zip line ride, restaurant, gift shops, natural trail, and cruise ship dock."
1002,Great service and the room was comfortable.  The internet was going out regularly but the place was still great.
1003,"Great place, and friendly staff. Got my eyebrows waxed, and loved the results/new look. Getting scheduled in for an appointment is easy and convenient also."
1004,"Very bad food, my calzone was no good."
1005,Perfectionist installed a Drone Mobile remote start in my vehicle earlier this week and I couldn't be happier with it. I arrived a few minutes early for my appointment and there was already a few people in line. Thankfully it moved quickly and I was out the door a few minutes later. My car was done on time and the salesperson was very helpful in getting the remote start app configured and made sure I knew how to use it. The installer even left a courtesy bottle of water for me in the car! I'll be referring friends to Perfectionist from now on.
1006,"Average, but the counter clerk was pleasant. Made all the difference in the world. Thanks for the Cookies!"
1007,Pretty much everything you need!
1008,"Great little place! Good food, good people!"
1009,Never crowded

1011,Gigantic holes that will mess up vehicles and the parkers triple parked vehicles in some locations.
1012,So much MSG ...
1013,Good coffee
1014,"Great Burger place, with vegetarian options. I loved the smash tots as well."
1015,Beautiful scenery!
1016,I was in Valdez for work and needed a new pair of xtra stuffs STAT. The Prospector has your outdoor needs covered. Not to mention some cool local stickers!
1017,In my opinion this place is overpriced and does not serve quality chicken. Been here several times and the sandwiches are very average and it has wings in its name but doesn’t live up to the expectation. There is very little meat on their wings compared to other places in town. Overall after four or five trips I think I’m done with this place.
1018,"A large beer list of mostly just their own concoctions. I love eating here - the location, the ambiance, and the massive menu. that said they don't have the best beers in town. food is killer tho and it's a fun place to hang and eat/drink. enough tvs around the ground floor to catch a game"
1019,"Better make sure someone else doesn't make your online order if you're the one going to pick it up, or else it's like pulling teeth getting it from the clerks."
1020,Great breakfast and awesome service
1021,"Wolverine, Nearpoint, Williwaw, etc etc!"
1022,"Great food, wonderful service!"
1023,"Happy, friendly staff. Excellent food!"
1024,One of my favorite short hikes!
1025,Love the river walk
1026,Best restaurant
1027,"Good selection, clean, and well organized. Courteous  staff but management will not let them help you. The staff are trained to be like robots. Would like to see them more friendly and helpful."
1028,"While I miss Sam's Club, they are a great substitute.  I think of the place more like an oversized grocery store, the si,ea are just larger."
1029,Coconut shrimp was wonderful!
1030,I just love the girls in the morning
1031,"A rugged ""beach front"" bar and grill. A bit touristy"
1032,Great views and price!
1033,"It's been years since I've been, but I have been to Sara many times for hair extensions. The experience was amazing every single time, with results that blew me away. Those who didn't know me personally (of course friends&family noticed my hair went from chin to low back overnight) had no idea my hair was anything but natural. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend her! Prices are up front and more than fair for extensions, and the skill here is incredible. Using the microbead method, taking the time to do it RIGHT, and creating a friendly and epic experience, I will be going back in the future. Even if I lived in Anchorage, I would make the trip to 27 Red for this service just to know with confidence that the end result will look great and last a good long while! Top salon, top stylist, definitely has my loyalty."
1034,Great smoked salmon
1035,"My dog is old and she's having some issues.  I was thankful my veterinarian recommended PET Emergency Treatment for an ultrasound.  The customer service was relaxed and helpful.  I was happy to hear that my dog doesn't have liver issues when I picked her up, so now I'm waiting on the blood tests.  I hoping everything goes well, but I can say that I'm happy with the doctor and staff at PET Emergency Treatment.  I recommend arriving first thing in the morning to drop off your pet because there was no one here at 8AM.

1036,The employees are very helpful and happy. Nice place to sit and converse while waiting for an oil change and tire repair. The kids enjoyed filling up cups of water and drinking it from the machine!
1037,"Excellent,"
1038,Seven Glaciers had excellent food and professional service.
1039,"We were so lucky this place was still open in the winter. The food and drinks were awesome. Best part, after being outside for the ice sculpting competition, we were able to sit next to the fireplace. In the spring, I bet the views near the windows are awesome."
1040,Great bar for MNF!!!
1041,"(Translated by Google) The museum dedicates shop windows to the various native Alaskan towns. Inside the museum there are positions of artists and artisans who make and sell their products. Outside, there are recreations of the different types of housing, mostly underground and snow, made of wood, with ingenious protected entry and exit accesses, and a pleasant forest, with totem sculptures. It is a modest museum, something far from the center and in my opinion expensive and overvalued. The Anchorage Museum is more representative, rigorous and interesting on these topics.

(Original)
El museo dedica escaparates a los diversos pueblos nativos de Alaska. Dentro del museo hay puestos de artistas y artesanos que elaboran y venden sus productos. Fuera, hay recreaciones de los distintos tipos de vivienda, la mayoría bajo tierra y nieve, hechas de madera, con ingeniosos accesos de entrada y salida protegidos, y un agradable bosque, con esculturas de totem. Es un museo modesto, algo lejos del centro y en mi opinión caro y sobrevaluado. El Anchorage Museo es mås representativo, riguroso e interesante sobre estos temas."

1048,"The owners was fantastic very friendly and helpful and was very particular with his indoor and outdoor cleaning routine which I absolutely appreciate!! Very affordable, convenient location in Eagle River and some of the best hospitality I have received in a long time."
1049,Wanted to do a quick amazon drop off. About 4 people in line ahead of me because employees were taking forever. They were very rude to the customers the were helping and didn’t seem willing to do the job they’re getting paid to do. Ended up leaving and going to the Tudor location and I’m glad I did. Employees at Tudor are always quick and nice. I’ve never had a great experience at this location and I’ve learned my lesson today- It’s worth it to drive out of my way and go to Tudor.
1050,"Been there once in lifetime, and the experience was great. Was hooking to spend 4 nights there coming from the rural community only to end up not going due to appointments canceled and rescheduled. Recommended for all first timers experience"
1051,The people always think you're conning them. Renting from these people is rough.
1052,If you like a whole bunch of gift shops all in one place this is the place for you
1053,Like ice cream
1054,"Stopped to commemorate this significant geographical landmark.  The country around us is fantastic, to think, this road made it possible, the only link for people in a car to have this opportunity."

1063,They store my liquor
1064,Swear to god
1065,Everything I needed in one stop for my kitchen and flooring upgrades
1066,Awesome
1067,Alaska's best
1068,"If you want to wait a half hour for your coffee, this is the place. Coffee wasn't bad. The wait time was excruciatingly long. With all the choices out there I would hope that they would speed up their times."
1069,Coupons are great!
1070,Lines are hassle have 12 registers but only 2 open.
1071,Always fresh food and family friendly service. I love because they always have a smile and are always happy to serve great food.the price is pretty Reasonable.
1072,Friendly and very welcoming. Inside is very pretty
1073,Owner has neglected Northway mall to build this
1074,Good customer service but out of stock of the two items I needed.
1075,"Just tried Jewel Lake Pizza & Tea Garden for the first time. Delivery order of Mongolian Beef, Shrimp Lobster Sauce, and a Pepperoni Pizza for the kids. My wife enjoyed the Shrimp, kids said the pizza was OK. I was not happy with the Mongolian Beef, the taste was good, but the dish was 75% or more Onion. I could not believe how little beef there was! I had to hunt for beef on the first bite. Not happy, can't imagine I'll be ordering from here again."
1076,The staff is friendly.
1077,"They know their job, and do it perfectly everytime."
1078,It has neat stores

1081,My favor Store always
1082,"Tried these guys for the first time and there wings are under average!!!! .Kinda on the small side but they threw in extra so that made up for it.. Average flavor, nothing spectacular???

Also got there chicken strips and fries combo and I must say that there fries are terrible, and there chicken  strips are way under average!!

Work on your fries and wingsize and I'll possibly consider if I'm in the neighborhood."
1083,Fast and nice!
1084,"Long day at work and got a Longer one at  home. So I stopped in after work, so I could get Stoned. Got a great deal!"
1085,The best mall in Anchorage
1086,"They still don't use Android/Samsung/Apple pay which is an annoyance.

Store has a reasonable TSEM section and some board games and a good magazine section."
1087,"Alaska LASER wash is a great touchless car wash.  Never too busy and the guy there, Jamal is so helpful and fun to talk to.  I'll be back, that's for sure!"

1092,The food on the buffet is all delicious!
1093,Beautiful
1094,They survived the earthquake and still have good food.
1095,Larger selection then other Fred Meyer. Burrito bar and Salad bar are pretty good.
1096,"This location has issues. I waited in the drive through with just a couple of other cars for half an hour. When I got to the window, only half my order had been made, and had I not mentioned it, I could have left without them noticing. I would avoid them."
1097,Nice place wasen't super impressive however nice
1098,"Great customer service, took vehicle in for oil change and enjoyed the goodies at the food stand they had for sale."
1099,"Great family place, super sweet staff, great food. Loved the rice. Pretty messy as a Togo order, FYI on the chicken and beef as they're shredded in sauce. But the flavor was excellent."

1103,Nice theater
1104,Expensive
1105,Good job cleaning and washing grungy AK cars. They will put you through again if not pleased with your wash!
1106,"This pace used to be a favorite, but it's lost its appeal. I try to stop in every few months, but I always leave uninspired. Food is average, staff friendly, but atmosphere is lacking. I see this place going under if they don't do something to improve the experience"
1107,"As always a favorite go to place to eat out, with a variety of delicious food! Never had a bad experience and they have great customer service. When covid calms down it will be nice to dine there again."
1108,Always feels like home
1109,We went for shoes. Not a huge selection but definitely all that you need. The lady that helped us was very attentive to our needs. They did a gait analysis and squared us away with shoes. My wife was unsure about hers si they told her that she could take them home try them out and if they didn't work bring them back. This place has amazing customer service! Definitely our go to for shoes and cycling needs now.
1110,"Wow, what a great little place to stock up on Halloween costumes. Very competitive prices and a great ambiance about the place! Would go again. Two thumbs up here"
1111,Very helpful staff wide variety of things to do and see as well as sanctioned card games set up for our kids to do rather than being out on the streets doing drugs or drinking alcohol and getting in trouble thanks Boscos
1112,Was good but not as big or as cheap as I remembered
1113,"Great place to get washers and dryers fixed,"
1114,3 year EPMS member here and sometimes I forget why I pay dues to this establishment. Customer service is worse than Comcast... staff is always unpleasant and speak down to you like a child. Go to Rabbit Creek!!!
1115,Big volume similar to Walmart bit more expensive
1116,The pizza isn't all that great. The beer should be colder and I was told my son could not sit and have pizza with me while other parents have their children with them. I doubt I will make a choice to go back.
1117,Reminds me of Southern cooking from my hometown Atlanta
1118,"Looking to get a new tattoo, or cover up an old one? This is the place!"
1119,I absolutely adore these guys! Stop in for a bite! You wont be disappointed
1120,"Overpriced fare without the quantity to make it a value. What do you expect, though, Princess owns all the fine dining in the area! The Rockfish is awesome no matter the price though!a"
1121,Only because they sponsor the softball team. I don't drink alcohol.
1122,Great all around place

1128,Very helpful!! Found what I was looking for right away!
1129,"Not by schedule. Bus came already almost full. All seats taken at hotel stops, before this station.  Tour was just OK. You can see more from your car and not to loose whole day."
1130,"Really clean place, it's brand new. Nice rooms and comfortable beds. Very close to shopping and a mall, also on a bus route."
1131,"Tasty crepes in Fairbanks. Coffee was great, crepes were tasty but could have used fresher vegetables. The wait was slightly long but we went for a Saturday brunch so understandable.."
1132,Great food
1133,Typical costco.
1134,"The best philly's! The wings are awesome too, not breaded with the perfect crisp and flavor.👌"
1135,They always greet as you come in the door and have answers to my gaming questions!
1136,Yum
1137,Half a star. Checked into their check in online. Showed 60 minutes. Go run a few errands show up and right before I walk in the door with my daughter she deleted my daughter's name. My daughter is 16 months old. We wait for these other people to get their hair cuts was told her hair doesn't look done but come back within 7 days to finish it. Still having to pay for a trim. And they said they thought I was getting my hair cut or they wouldn't have let her wait so long. Like does it matter my daughter was second to next and she deleted her name. Very poor she doesn't know their own check in program. Get your eyes checked lady
1138,"Used to be a cute little mall with lots of small shop, but in the last decade has sold of chunks to major chains such as Sportsman Warehouse, Pet Co., and Joanns. The rest of the mall is pretty empty now. The new owners seem to be cleaning up the place and look to have plans to improve the area. It's also a major bus stop for Capitol Transit."
1139,Good place. Good food. Good service. Great milkshakes. Drive thru in the back. Really like the Phillys.
1140,"Love their raspberry rolls & their prarie bread is nutritious & delicious. Prices are a little steep, but I'm willing to pay it for a quality product, in a locally owned store."

1142,cheap stuff
1143,I received my drink in about 5 minutes. No complaints.

1161,"Good good, good beverages, great service! Fun place with live music."
1162,Perfect
1163,Great and best priced air service that will take you to Denali (Kahiltna glacier). Their staff was very helpful on glacier as well (e.g. we forgot firestarter and spoon and they borrowed us one). After you come back you can expect awesome pie and refreshing fruit as nice treat.
1164,Best pizza I've had in the valley so far.
1165,Great place for your pets. I dont know cost because my work uses them and I only see the service side but they are always friendly and accommodating.
1166,Didn't appreciate from desk service not as a guest staying but invited for dinner. However room service workers and kitchen staff extremely polite and friendly helpful. Rooms are beautiful
1167,Hit or miss. Employees can never think for themselves. Too young.
1168,Love costco. Friendly employees.
1169,"I really enjoy going to the Writers Block,and their food is excellant,and there are Vegan options as well..so I spread the word to all my Vegan friends!"
1170,"Wasn't sure about the name as I was being bitten by a swarm of gnats, but the grilled burrito more than redeemed it. We got in off the water late, but the Shack stayed open later than their posted hours to take care of hungry people."
1171,The clerks were nice
1172,Love the food Staff is amazing!
1173,Great service good food

1176,Food was great....waiter sucked
1177,Sandwiches are really good. Tends.to be busy so sometimes takes a while.
1178,Excellent organic products and quality!
1179,"I was in town & got a call from my husband to pick up a list of supplies. I went in & gave my list to the guy & snap it was all gathered for me, checked out and I was only way. Great experience!"
1180,A real horticulturist runs the place. Always first class.
1181,Seated quickly. Let us move our seat to a booth. Waiter was perfect. Friendly and attentive. Food was good.  Came out quick! Only downside is sitting near a window is freezing cold
1182,"(Translated by Google) It is a very simple place with its stands for the show, some kiosks for sale. Even though I couldn't see the show because it started late, I took a walk. Since there weren't many people because of the Virus, I decided to go to the beach and take some photos

(Original)
Es un lugar muy simple con sus gradas para el espectáculo, algunos kioskos de venta. Aunque no logre ver el espectáculo porque comenzaba tarde, di una vuelta. Ya que por lo del Virus no había mucha gente, decidí ir a la playa y pude tomar unas fotos"
1183,Enjoyed food & service & customer welcomed my husband as Veteran Vet
1184,Long line. Hard to figure it out. Not what I expected. Still not sure been 2 times and threw both out.
1185,"Great little place with a warm cabin feel.  The staff was super friendly and attentive.  The food was very good, we tried the fish n chips, grilled cod w/pasta,  reindeer meatloaf and sliced rib-eye on a pretzel bun.  We would certainly return!"
1186,They have the goods if not they know where to order them from.
1187,Delicious food!
1188,"As usual the food was amazing, however this time the service was not attentive and made continuous mistakes."
1189,Brain in the mining section was a real help. He was able to give me some ideas on how to upgrade my older dredge system with new pieces that will help me recover more gold.
1190,Very beautiful beach with outstanding views of the Guard Island area. Always lots of logs to sit on. Good places for a beach fire. Nicely maintained forest area to walk around in. No public restroom at this beach and there is a pretty limited parking area.
1191,Good workout
1192,They have wonderful name brand clothes and items at reasonable prices from Michael Kors to true religion for hundreds of dollars less so you can look fresh without a stank price lol
1193,I always love walking around this place. There's always something new
1194,Fresh made burritos.
1195,Nice coffee shop with local ambiance
1196,They told us our visit would be covered by our insurance so we made the appointment.  Come to find out a month later that we now have to pay for our visit.  I asked them why they told us our insurance would cover it and they said they wouldn't know until they sent in the bill.  So why did you confirm that our insurance would cover it then?  Don't trust them.
1197,"5 stars for service and atmosphere and a few of my favorite brews. That being said, I dont have much micro brew experience. I know all of our beer tenders and alot of our locals enjoy a pint or 2 after work most days. 2 PINT MAX.  ITS GREAT! Sometimes too noisy but avoid ""HAPPY HOUR"" and afternoons are peaceful and weekends vary. This is a great spot for a short social with friends and pooches ( yes, dogs allowed on a leash and good behavior) and little ones too ( no leash, but well behaved and with parents always) 🙂. Enjoy a sample if your not sure. Like something and dont want to hang, get a growler to go or a ""medicine bottle"".T shirts, hoodies and souvenir glasses and other swag. You'll have to stop in and see. You may even admire/ purchase artwork from any one of local talented artists. Maybe even say hi to me.
Or check out those colorful sunrises"
1198,Awesome burgers as always. Prepare for a 30 min wait at prime time or call ahead for pickup. The burgers are worth the wait though.
1199,"Hot and delicious, great service."
1200,"Always clean, lots of help.  Sometimes short on stock, but it is Alaska."
1201,Can totally just drive right by and take pictures. Super cold! But so pretty and loud.
1202,Spenard builders have good consultant people.  We had them help design our replacement deck with TREX and was very satisfied.  It would be to their benefit to streamline the pickup department.
1203,Best transportation in Fairbanks!
1204,Criscut fries
1205,"(Translated by Google) All very good, the amount of food goes in proportion to the price.

(Original)
Todo muy bueno, la cantidad de comida va en proporción con el precio."
1206,They catch people who steal from them and then shame them publicly on Facebook. It's kind of like the Jerry Springer show combined with an old school grocery warehouse. Funny as hell.
1207,Convenient location and has everything you need.
1208,Super friendly great food
1209,Best coffee in town. Coffee always comes out smooth and not to sweet. Highly recommend them!
1210,"Nome is lucky to have a movie theater at all, and Gold Coast Cinema amazingly has comparable prices on tickets and concessions to theaters on the road system. Movies often arrive several weeks late, but that's part of life in rural Alaska."
1211,"Great food,  delicious beer and good environment"
1212,The food is good and good for you... it's always fresh and hot...fast service...
1213,"Decent price, comfortable seating, not too packed."

1217,Extremely helpful.  Carried stuff to the counter for me
1218,Didn't eat or ice skate at arena but eat he'd a friend's kids take hockey lesson.  Looked like a really nice arena with lots of local activities.
1219,"I had to take the CPR and first aid course for my new job, and he was very informative, easy to understand and made us feel confident in saving a life if the need ever arises. He offered refreshments too which is nice. I love his mix of humor in his slideshows to ease up the class. While I give 5 stars, I do want to mention that I know snakes aren't in Alaska, but I wish a little more was covered in that area concerning snake bites in case we travel outside of Alaska. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the class and I will recommend to anyone in the Anchorage area."
1220,Open till 5
1221,"Great customer service, very nice people"
1222,The facility definitely has it's views.  The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for a resort.  They do have a way to get notofied of when denali becomes visible as well as the northern lights.
1223,"Kind staff who work quick. A bit pricey, but oh my god! Incredible gelato!!"
1224,"Went shopping for house goods...they had very low inventory.  Then spent almost 30 minutes in the ""Speedy"" check out lane.  Wasn't the fault of the customers not being able to count, the clerk was extremely slow and very incompetent.   Come on Walmart you are better than this!"
1225,"It’s really nice place on summer time, you can find an event every Thursday"
1226,Good eating . Pleasant
1227,"TGF LeRoys!
Legit diner 24/7
Not a Denny's"
1228,Nice place to visit with family
1229,Great service
1230,Commies
1231,"Has a nice selection of water, metal, wood, and clay pipes. Staff is friendly and will give you their honest opinion on the durability of the pipe you choose. They also have drinks, flavored e cig cartridges, hoodies, blankets, and knives."
1232,They have what you need.
1233,The server super sucked and the lobster was dry
1234,Everyone who works here that I have encountered were wonderful! I loved my experience here and if I ever need to store again they will be my first choice!
1235,Kinda shady
1236,Amazing food great service.
1237,An excellent buffet and a great place to see a cross section of Anchorage residents.

1239,Tons of gifts and souvenirs!
1240,Good food. Friendly staff. BEAUTIFUL views!
1241,Good food and service at a decent price
1242,Great
1243,Lamb sliders were bomb! Highly recommend!
1244,Great service and food.
1245,"For the price they charged I expected a lot more from this museum, it is not really a place for children. Some exhibits can be fascinating, others quite a bore. There are only around four rooms you can enter, there is a downstairs. The downstairs is home to their laboratory, which I've heard great things about. But, unfortunately you have to schedule a tour. Which I'm sure cost a pretty penny."
1246,Nice store
1247,Awesome service even when busy!! Chris is the best server and we will be back frequently!!!!!
1248,"Shopped at 5th Ave Mall on 7/10/2018.  Needed to use a restroom while on the 2nd floor.  Was told there were none on the 2nd floor and to go up to the 3rd floor.  When I entered the 3rd floor women’s restroom, all the stalls were occupied by young women doing drugs.  They would not speak or make any attempts to leave.  Security was contacted.  They came and stood by the outer door until the addicts were done and left.  Numerous shoppers, some with children, were turned away during this time.  No one wanted to use the stalls after them anyway.  Those of us who couldn’t hold it were directed to the restroom at Nordstroms.  This isn’t the first time I’ve seen addicts in the 5th Ave Mall.  I like some of the stores but it will be a long time before I venture back.  Don’t feel safe and also tired of paying to park."
1249,"No sales person ever approached us. ""Sale"" prices were regular prices. I am NEVER impressed with these guys...ever."
1250,Franchise outlet. All appears normal from a corporate view. Use discount codes or coupons. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER UNLESS YOU WANT TEXT NOTIFICATIONS DAILY.
1251,"Love the fresh produce, hate how crowded the isles can get from discount bins/displays."
1252,Great customer service and knowledgeable staff.   They are one of the only places ive found 5.11 tactical gear in Anchorage.   Pretty good selection of firearms and related items.
1253,super expensive and not friendly stuff
1254,"Beautiful venue. I played violin for a wedding and reception here, perfect sound for acoustic music!"
1255,Right size. Good coats
1256,The salsa bar is awesome!
1257,You can't opt out of their text service. Products sold here are meh. Amateurs need to stop focusing on bogus strains and start focusing on the brands that grow them.
1258,"Clean restaurant, excellent food, great customer service"
1259,The service was excellent at this particular outlet. The food was on point. My visit was all in good energy.
1260,"Fun and different than everyday dinning
Update: ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️went from 4 *'s to 2 *'s
Been their lots.  Mostly been fine until 9/1/18
Went for my Birthday. I'm ok with a new cook, but this guy was miserable.  You could tell he had no idea what he was doing and he didn't seem to care because he obviously didn't want to be there.  Plus our waitress forgot our drinks twice and then our rice. We finally got it when our meal was over.  Very disappointed."
1261,Small clean good
1262,no shoe store yet or footlocker
1263,Great gym and never too busy. Caters more towards cross fit and overall fitness than powerlifting or bodybuilding.
1264,"The most beautiful National Park I have been to, hands down!"
1265,"I wish there had been rooms available here when my travel was being booked - all the staff were extremely friendly and professional, and the event I attended was well-organized."
1266,"Great food, great prices, good atmosphere."
1267,Awsome
1268,"Wonder atmosphere, wonderful service. Bright atmosphere, servers who stay on top of your drink, and eating enjoyment.
Recommend for an enjoyable meal or an evening out. Thank you Gallo's Mexican Restaurant."
1269,Awesome. Check it out for yourself.
1270,They bend over backwards to make sure you get what you need and or want.

1279,Always great ;) good food great service and hood atmosphere.
1280,Amazing fresh food
1281,I like burritos...
1282,Great views.
1283,I've eaten here a few times and never been disspointed. The food is served in a timely manner and always hot. My silverware was less then clean so a better dishwasher maybe needed. The price is fair compared to the quality of food. The walls are looking rough inside. So I like to see some money reinvested back in to the business.
1284,Extremely long wait time to get food
1285,Loved the food. It was about a 30 minute wait (Sunday lunch time) but it was worth it he food was good and we loved having the gluten free and vegan options for those that needed it.
1286,"Taco bell is the only restaurant that has implemented and actually follows a more sanitary approach,  keeping all cash/card transactions separate from food , using gloves and touching your food items including the packaging as little as possible"
1287,Good food and service
1288,"Comfy, family style small restaurant with good truck stop or mom's cooking. Tasty with more than enough quantity. Very good service and friendly atmosphere."
1289,Delicious
1290,Salad bar tastes so fresh mm! Thank you
1291,Awesome! Brand new winter boots 👍👍
1292,"Lousy management, over priced!"
1293,Went for dinner with my husband. Server was very kind and attentative but my food was garbage. My husbands cheap plate was fresh and tasted ok. My very expensive seafood plate wasn't even room temperature as if it was prepared for someone else then left sitting under a heat lamp for 3 hours. Highly dissapointing.
1294,I love that when I call yo make my pet a appointment for a bath that he gets the same person every time.. I think it makes it better on my dog...
1295,"Affordable Vehicles and range selections! Friendly staff and very helpful ""sure they have knowledge about cars!"" Appreciate their assistance specially to Mr. Ali Solat. Great Job!"

1300,Awesome store
1301,"food was really good, small place and service was a touch slow for the size and manpower. over all I have a good time I just had to clean my own table, ask for napkins, and then ask for the bill at the end."
1302,"Very good ""heart attack roll"""
1303,"DEFINITELY call in if you go during 11-2. The wait isn't too long, but it's long enough to get impatient if you're looking for a quick lunch.
Food was excellent. One star off for the small dining area and the slightly long wait in-store."
1304,Customer service was very friendly. Product is grouped in easy to find locations.
1305,Went to get the covid vaccine. Was spacious enough to accommodate a lot of people safely.
1306,The kids love this park. Lots of space.
1307,Can find tires

1313,"They are always on the ball, these guys care about the work they provide. They have built trust with me and my family."
1314,Nice store.
1315,"Very quick check-in process for my first time visit. They took my car right in for an oil change. And it was done 15 minutes! It was suggested that my car use synthetic oil, and I was just going to go with a basic, but the friendly worker at the desk sold me on the suggestion. Super nice people all around, thank you for making sure my Nissan (Raider) Rogue vehicle is up to spiff!"
1316,"Harbor Sub... Mini Pizza on a Hoagie, Yummy 😋"
1317,Unbelievable views
1318,Good pizza. Nice folks

1321,Beautiful pictures!
1322,"Found the park while I got lost driving! Clean, well kept park, nice seating area for parents"
1323,Better than most
1324,Good except for the wedding party who would not share their cupcakes.
1325,"Good gas station, friendly staff. Liquor store aside."
1326,Employees seem a little more friendly since walmart hired a private security Co.
1327,Everything you need for hunting is here.
1328,Its Denali park! The national park is one of the great wilderness areas in America! You have to experience it in this life!
1329,Beef brisket is awesome
1330,The food was delicious and in large portions.
1331,Some of the best Pho in town!
1332,Never wanted to leave! I could get lost in there for days finding treasures!
1333,This is as close as you can get to a Safeway in the city.
1334,Great food and service
1335,Birdwatching and trail walking by the water.
1336,"Great place to stock up on paper goods, bulk foods and  bakery items."
1337,There's water it's cheap it's always open I think and it's clean
1338,Fair prices and great subs!!
1339,So addicted to this store! It feeds my yarn addiction!
1340,"Very respectful, made sure they got a full understanding of what i wantrd done"
1341,Door dash delivers late takeout from here.
1342,People are rude
1343,"Fantastic juice bar. Had a burger, it was made of deliciousness."

1345,Excellent food and the service was good. Nice decor .
1346,Great coffee and welcoming cozy environment

1350,Very convenient
1351,This place has amazing drinks! Each cocktail I had was amazing! Now the food though....just as great! I love the chili fries those things are great!
1352,Saw a couple big ships go by
1353,Best liquor store in Anchorage
1354,Very nice clean store never too busy I can always go down the isles no problem not running into people they have a big selection too
1355,I used to work there I'm not angry employee I'm not but you guys should really check out their kitchen. Just because they pass inspection does not mean they paid off the inspector just saying
1356,Great plants and stuff women like.
1357,"Nice, outside is a bit outdated, inside is very nice. Touristy."
1358,"Dimond Center is a great place to do pretty much anything in Anchorage, Alaska from Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner type food vendor's,Fresh Fruit Smoothies and Ice Cream, to head to toe new, hip and trendy clothing, apparel, footwear and accessories from all the well-known clothing companies such as; American Eagle, Aeropostale, Pac Sun, Zumiez, Old Navy, Forever 21, Gap, Hot Topic and H&M. If you are not there for food or clothing don't worry, Dimond Center has Video Game, Hobby& Comic book and Electronics stores like Game Stop, Boscos and Best Buy. Also a full size Movie Theater, ice skating rink, Arcades, Bowling Alley, A Fully decked out Recreation Center for  teens and young adults and a full size fitness center with a pool. You can also find  armed forces recruiting stations and pull tabs lounges For older, legally aged customers. Compared to other mall's, especially in the big cities of the lower 48, Dimond Center is rather small and compacted. However, the compact design is rather helpful in most cases, all the stores and vendors within eye sight of one another makes for a quick, convenient and easy shopping experience. All of the staff and employees are always happy, cheerful and eager to help, greeting you at the door with a smile and a,""Welcome come on in.""and ""How can we help."" Dimond Center is a very safe and family friendly environment great for friends, family and kids of all ages. They have full time security guards patrolling inside and out along with a security room where they can observe all goings on inside throughout every store inside and out, from the outer doors and perimeter and up and down all the Isles of there massive parking lots. I can honestly say that I have never seen or heard of an incident where the security guards or the APD had to get involved occurring at Dimond Center. I can only think of one slightly negative observation/experience I can attest to at Dimond Center and that is because Dimond Center is smaller but still has pretty much all the same stores and attractions as a big city mall, it can get really busy and slightly crowded, especially around the Holidays."
1359,Big fat greek with braised lamb tzatziki onion and olive might be my new favorite pizza ever
1360,"Excellent critter care. Personable, knowledgeable, caring team. Clean, open environment."
1361,"There's plenty to see every day. Today we watched the dog performers and shopped the vendors. My niece showed me her 4H displays and ribbons for her crafts wins. My uncle and I walked to the fair from his house a mile away which was good exercise. I was impressed by the clear explanation on the No Dogs Allowed sign. People need the law explained to them because dogs are animals - not children. A certified trained physical-support dog is legal. Emotional support dogs are illegal at the fair - they are untrained and go bonkers when they see any other dogs. This makes the work of a genuinely trained dog almost impossible because it has to guard its handler instead of supporting him. Also, working dogs don't socialize. I saw a man with his dog try to approach the dog performers after their show in order to ""greet"" them. This is proof of an untrained dog. Someone with a trained dog would never risk that. I don't know how he got into the fair. His dog had no vest. We need more signs like that, tho. Educate the public."
1362,Shawn is my trainer and he's the best!
1363,Great and fun for a tourist place by the pier.
1364,Best coffee in Alaska!
1365,"Fast service,  good staff and decent food."
1366,"A great place to visit and its right in Anchorage! Thr coffee shop makes great lattes, the zoo is well kept and has a great variety of exhibits. Dont miss the river otters!"
1367,Loved the service their. Me and my best friend got matching tattoos and they were awesome. The artist nailed our tattoos we were very happy.
1368,Always a place to visit and the down part is Hallmark employee's are racist against the natives of Alaska
1369,"I always go to Taco Bell for a quick bite, I love the nacho fries and cheese quesadillas. My boyfriend loves the crunch wraps and steak quesadillas."
1370,The little ones love it and does this Grandma lol
1371,Gotta love burgers. They have other options but they do best at what they are known for. Parking lot isn't great but that's the biggest complaint. Clean and comfortable inside. Nice service although not as much energy as usual with their birthday singing. But enjoyable none the less.
1372,"Some employees are rude and uninterested in providing customer service. It's really unfortunate. I go out of my way to avoid this location now, and go to the Abbott location."
1373,One of the best things Fairbanks
1374,I can't even believe these still exist.. Lol very spotty collection. But a great blast from the past.
1375,Seems to be slowly closing everything
1376,Great service and delicious food.
1377,Great pizza!  (and radio shack too)
1378,"Always good for a quick and quiet bite to eat. Salad bar is solid,  not spectacular."
1379,"Please read

called the lady before I went in to see if they had openings for the day, and the price for a full set of matte blue acrylic nails. She told me it starts at $20 and ends at $40. So I was like yay cheap nails!!! But no. I went there, and Halfway through getting my nails done , the man doing my nails adds up my price on a napkin and said “the total is $80” WHAAAAT. I was annoyed. I wasn’t going to say no because he was halfway finished so I said okay. I should’ve mentioned the lady on the phone told me $40 but I didn’t. And all I got on my nails were the acrylic blue matte polish and initials of my bf on two of my nails. The customer service was good tho."
1380,Typical Walmart layout and function. They are enforcing face coverings at the front which I like. Once you're inside people are kind of doing whatever they feel like but at least Walmart is making an effort.
1381,Great   food and service
1382,Friendly staff
1383,Went to KFC in diamond I ordered food through the drive-through and the person didn't seem like he knew what he was doing
1384,Understandable delay with front desk service but very welcoming overall. Rates range from 75 to 85 a night plus tax
1385,Clean comfy. But a bit pricey
1386,Great Blu-ray solection
1387,"The food was good, 3 stars because of the price which seems over priced for the quality and quantity."
1388,Nice restraunt
1389,"THE BEST AND MOST HELPFUL BARISTAS!!! Whenever I didnt know something, they got the answer for me quickly! I love them for some of the best customer service and speedy services. Did amazing during covid!"
1390,Clean..   Professional..  Beautiful!
1391,Friendly staff.
1392,Great specials that are always fresh and new.
1393,My girl had a blast. Thank you!
1394,Professional services
1395,"Quick service, friendly staff.
Picked up some Scones, Cookies and a Cinnamon Roll. We tried a little of everything and it was all Delicious ☺"
1396,It was very good I dined in service was good no complaints it was good food
1397,The girl was very sweet. The drinks are amazing. Would definitely go again.
1398,Best food ever and service is always top notch
1399,The only place in town for this.
1400,Always love their musubi...
1401,"Cool spot. Nice natural hot springs in the Alaska wilderness. Quite a few buildings make up this ""resort"". It's will built up. We started y in a dry cabin and it was pleasant.
A couple issues: inside every building is incredibly hot. Super hot. The restaurant was unbearably hot. The cabin was so hot we had to open up the windows to let it cool down. I guess it's hard to regulate the heat source, seeing as it's all naturally heated by circulating spring water. I wish the restaurant had windows to open.
Speaking of the restaurant, prepare to wait. I'm not sure if it's due to inadequate staffing, or just a nonchalant approach. Either way, takes about 15 minutes to be acknowledged, another 10 to 15 to be seated, and yet another 10 to 15 to get a server to notice you. After all the waiting, the food was good, beer selection was pretty good. Don't get mixed drinks. Moscow mule was not a mule.

The hot spring is cool. But the locker rooms are filthy. Super gross. Wear sandals, or flip flops. Do not enter barefoot.
The pool (outdoor) is big, and hot and wonderful! Sand bottom is a nice touch."
1402,"Great brews, great vibe."
1403,The chicken parmesan was so good... moist
1404,Had a great puppy class with Mary Lou!
1405,Foods okay not the greatest service
1406,"Very clean,  front desk lady very nice.  Good restaurant. Beautiful view of the Harbor even in winter."
1407,"This is a beautiful place to stay, but there is no air conditioning in the rooms."
1408,"Picture in your head the most perfect, quaint, artsy, mellow, warm little coffee shop. You have just envisioned Resurrect Art coffee shop!"
1409,Best pizza and beer
1410,They serve the same sandwiches and hardly ever have any new sandwiches and when they do introduce one it's only for a limited time only I think that they should do a contest to have some new sandwiches introduced and the sandwich with the most sales wins
1411,"It's a great place to take out-of-towners who are looking for Alaska souvenirs and gifts. Excellent selection, from cheap trinkets to high class art. Plus the chocolate fountain is fun to watch!"
1412,"Great flight, safe, beautiful scenery. Recommend landing on glacier"
1413,Always fun with the kids! Missing the train rides this year.
1414,Workers are hard to find and don't know where products are unless they stock them. Checkouts take forever. Most expensive fruits and veggies in town. But better than Walmart.
1415,Best food EVER. Wonderful people. Great prices. Great view.
1416,Great choice for higher quality fast food! Fast good Mexican food made with just what you want on it. Also feels cleaner than a lot of similar restaurants I've been.
1417,Nice valentine's day decorations
1418,Great flavors and a bit of an upgrade from the one in Fairbanks.
1419,Stay away! There only concern is money. They dont even care they served rotten chicken. It was green on inside.
1420,This place is a real gem and a great place to spend an afternoon. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and the animals appear very well cared for. I appreciated having the stories of how each animal came to the conservation center on display. We arrived in time to see staff discuss the bears they care for and it was an incredible exhibition. Well worth it!
1421,Great rolls and a fried Oreo free dessert
1422,They are rude on certain shifts when I ask for a cup holder and sometimes a bag.
1423,"Like the name says, when you're here, your right at home. Killer motzy stix and redbull, just like mom used to make, and friendly staff."
1424,nice place
1425,Nice clean place. Locating the office was a bit confusing but everything else was great. I would definitely stay here again.
1426,Good service.
1427,Quick service and pet friendly place!
1428,Dim Sum! And the best cake in town hands down!
1429,Food was great. Service was slow. Took more than 15 minutes too get drinks. Food was served within 30 min of order. Waitress seemed new. Nice lady.
1430,"Great selection for natural animal food, prices are comparable to amazon prime."
1431,What an awesome store. They always have what I need.
1432,"Responded to online question about products quickly. Drove 100 miles to get there, not only did they have what I needed but I received helpful advice from Nick Gavora. Everyone was super friendly. Definitely a 5 Star local family business thats been around since I was a kid. Highly recommend!"
1433,Enjoyed this place very much
1434,"Sharp atmosphere. I was very impressed with this establishment. The food was all priced accordingly, they offer a military discount, didnt charge extra for sweet potato fries and the beer prices were great!
I ended up ordering their sriracha jalapeno burger. It was actually spicy, which never really happens for me as someone who orders a burger from nost restaurants atleast once.
I will absolutely be a returning customer to this establishment."
1435,Beautiful
1436,PHOnatik ngon qua! I've been to Việt Nam several times and this is the closest you'll get unless you have Vietnamese family members.
1437,Yum
1438,Extremely helpful and knowledgeable staff. They also have a wide selection of ingredients to choose from here.
1439,"Quiet quaint cafe perfect for small business meeting and they have great food at a good price. I ordered the Reuben and it was one of the best Reuben's I have eaten. With most restaurants the bottom piece of bread is soggy, this was perfect. Very friendly and attentive staff. Would recommend"
1440,"I was charged twice for my transaction. Caught it within a half hour, and informed the manager. I was given a case number, and had to wait 10 days for a refund."
1441,Very well stocked Wal Mart. This a big Wal Mart
1442,Good spot too chill and relax
1443,Gas
1444,"We really like this place and went out of our way to make sure we ordered out from them when everything was shut down because we wanted to be supportive. But they nickel and dime you for everything. We don’t go there too often for this reason and every time we do I’m annoyed by it. Like their food, but it’s too expensive for what you get."
1445,Just as awesome as I remember it from my time stationed in Louisiana
1446,Wait time was good in the drive through and they got the order correct
1447,"LOVE the service, order at the counter, self seating indoor and patio. Delicious fish, portions what you expect. Price is market value for halibut and decent burgers at a decent price. 5 starts on cleanliness, service, product. Satisfied every visit!"
1448,Always the same
1449,Delicious food  and stylish decor don't let the outside appearance fool you.
1450,Good times
1451,"Very awesome store
Customer service is top notch"
1452,Best burger  in town!
1453,"(Translated by Google) Everything is super, only the animals were sleeping.

(Original)
Всё супер, только звери спали."
1454,The lava cheesesteak is to die for
1455,"Staff extremely helpful, friendly and down to earth.  Came here to get winter tires and wheels on our Suburban a couple weeks ago and it went really well and fast!  I'd recommend this place without reservation.  When I took my vehicle back last week as we thought the issue we were having a day or two later might have been new tire related they reviewed everything and went the extra mile.  The issue was actually completely unrelated as I found out a couple days ago however it was really nice to know they actually did a complete double check just in case."
1456,It is what u expect
1457,It'll be better when cars goes back in Sears Mall and then they won't call the Sears Mall anymore cuz there's no more Sears
1458,"We found The Spice and Tea Exchange on a vacation to Florida at Downtown Disney (before it became Disney Springs). When Liz opened her shop here in Anchorage, we were very happy and have been regular customers ever since. A wide range of spices, teas, sugars, and infusions make this shop a must visit place for any cook, amateur to professional. The shop has a bright, open floor plan, with lots of room to wander and browse the offerings. Liz encourages customers to open and smell the teas and spices. They have just recently added a tea bar where you can get a fresh brewed cup of any tea in the store, or try one of the premium brews. Great store, friendly people, knowledgeable staff."
1459,Yep!
1460,Friendly staff and veterinarians.   COVID friendly
1461,"Customer appreciation day, usually in and out under 10 minutes.  Pizza is delicious and priced right!"
1462,Kelsy was a big help with my new phone
1463,"I put money orders to pay my rent in the drop box at their building. So did many other people. Over the weekend their box was broken into. They want everyone to pay the rent AGAIN! I told them ""NO!"""
1464,5 doller pizza
1465,It's a stinky fun eclectic late night bar.
1466,Wonderful
1467,"Great experience at the food court.

Really happy to find that the prices are the same as in Seattle. Yay!"
1468,Good food and good service. I especially like their coffee.
1469,Love the massage parlor!
1470,"Awesome atmosphere, superb customer service, great food. Kind of pricey but this is Alaska and this is worth it!"
1471,I can't understand why this place is so busy. I've had better food from a middle school cafeteria. Not worth the ridiculous wait time.
1472,Quiet and pretty
1473,"Lots of sushi and rolls, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean food.  Their preparations are never overly sweet, and they are all flavorful.  Try it!"
1474,Food is ok for the price. Interior echoes too much. Needs additional decor to break that up. They use tap water in your high end coffee beans. Use filtered water and it will taste better. Not from a bottle because that creates too much waste.
1475,"Their pizza is ok, Alaska doesn't have a great standard for food"
1476,Wasted space. There's nothing here. A total of maybe 3 stores. One is a salon the other a nail shop.
1477,Nice and clean asian grocery and too many asian product. When I shop I miss my hometown.
1478,Good service as always
1479,"We love our little travel trailer, however i wish they would have sold me a rock guard with our purchase to protect the front window."
1480,Went down hill. Extremely slow service. Food is just average. Don't think I'll return. Shame it use to be good.
1481,Jared was quite pleasant to work with and set up a storage unit with. Only complaint was the front doors of the units seem to not close completely to the ground on many of the units.
1482,Damn good coffe
1483,"I like the store layout, items I shop for are easy to find.  The fresh fruit and vegetables are as good as they can be anywhere in Fairbanks.  Fred Meyer has a good rewards program and I usually hit starbucks on the way out."
1484,The new menu is awesome!!  You must try the sizzling brownie...your welcome!
1485,Delicious sandwiches with fresh ingredients!! Chowder was hot and delicious!!  There is also a desert case with scrumptious treats!!
1486,Friendly staff. Yummy burgers. And bottomless sides. What more could you want?
1487,Poppers and bronco berry sauce is great the chicken salad sandwich  is mighty tastey
1488,"Good costumer service. I bought a new sandwich. The cheddar beer triple stack. I didn't realize it had three different kinds of meat on it. So I wasn't sure if I should get one. The guy said it would be good and reasured me with ""If you don't like it you can bring it back and we will give you something you di like. very friendly!"
1489,Boo I hate this place so tacky and gross smells like old ppl
1490,"There is a great deal of construction going on right now, and the dining room wasn't even open.  So 3 stars.  When the construction is done, it might hop up to 4 or 5 stars."
1491,Great place to go for almost any gaming venture you may ..... 🙂
1492,Not only food for you. They also serve just  hamburger patties for your dogs!
1493,Nice spot on the river. Good food
1494,"Third shift isn't always great. Had to flag down the waitress several times. Food took FOREVER when there were only a few other parties (it was about 10 PM) and a man who came in long after us got his food about 20 minutes earlier (and I understand that he was only one person but we had a significant wait and I was painfully hungry after a long day of working). My burger had no sauce at all, making it rather bland. I like the food when it's made properly but I often have issues like the veggie burger being rock hard, not getting the toppings I ordered, not getting sauce, not getting the lettuce, tomato, pickle and onion, etc."
1495,"Cold , soggy food .first and last"
1496,Only place in valley to watch a good movie
1497,Ok bland overpriced
1498,"Really good service, but the menu needs a little work.  Creamy pesto sauce was more like thin soup.  Nice flavor, but didn't fit the dish.  Big puddle of sauce in the dish when the rest of the food was gone."
1499,Very fast drive thru
1500,The center was pretty cool on how there were a completely green building and where it was in there park. I really enjoyed the experience and definitely recommend visiting it.
1501,NICE
1502,Very nice
1503,"This place is never has anything stocked when I'm there. It's always dirty, because I found dirt balls and hair in the dressing room plus in between racks. And sometimes on the shelf."
1504,Interesting
1505,"Nothing else like this park. All the trails are fantastic, though some may be too difficult for many."
1506,These guys rock your hamburger socks off.  Eat here as often as you can
1507,"Went in for a muffler on my 67 and they did a awesome job with great respect to my car and my needs, I would recommend Muffler City to anyone, tell Jason Hello."
1508,"Went here after our Lumber Jack show, order the 2pcs Halibut fish n chips, their Salmon chowder with corn bread and their grilled Halibut as an extra dish with the Dungeness crab.

My favorite is the grilled halibut. Be prepared to line up during the busy lunch hour when all the cruise ships are dock at the same time.

1509,"Great deals, excellent weed, service with a smile! What's not to like?"
1510,"Best burgers around, wide variety shakes etc"
1511,"My family regularly goes to Donna's, mostly for their breakfast menu. They aren't the best restaurant in town, but they're good, they're cheap, and they're quick. The biggest downside is that Donna's is so popular it's difficult to get in during regular breakfast and lunch hours."
1512,Good service
1513,"Good Pizza,  nice beer sales, and great gas prices."
1514,Love this place soooooo good so friendly
1515,"This review is for ""I Fix It"" cell phone repair...DO NOT take your phone there for repair...the last owner took off with my phone and many other customers too and nowhere to be found!! stay away from this sink hole!"
1516,Great bubble tea. Convenient location near movie theatre.
1517,"I go for the open play from 8-noon for little kids. The cost is $5 per kid. I feel like for that price they ought to have more than a few lost soccer balls, some ratty old playhouses that barely stand up and a mini slide. I get that its just a way to make quick money during the down time, and it is a large area for the kids to run, but I think more people would bring their kids if they had items more like Spenard Rec or Alaska Moving Arts does for their open play. Toddlers do love to run, but their attention span is short and they also like to climb and ride."
1518,Best place in town for electronics but beware some of the workers have poor customer service skills and may talk down to you.
1519,WAY too expensive for the quality of the food.
1520,Besutiful view of the river with a great interior!
1521,Great!
1522,I've been all over the United States and the mountain is possibly the most dramatic and beautiful sight in the country. We love taking visitors here.
1523,"KBC is the spot, whether you need a quiet place to study or catch up with friends this establishment is the place to go...ove been a fan since 1993 and for me it still my go to for a cup of joe..community minded..Alaskan owned ...great people of the north this is the place to go....or if your on old Seward and need a pick me up Rae Rae's is a wonderful drive through coffee always just like you ordered and served with a smile. Tell them Becky sent you. Enjoy!!"
1524,A lot to do all in one convenient location!
1525,"Buy insurance, at least someone will be happy you flew Ravn."
1526,Everything you expect from this place... not much.
1527,"The first visit was so impressive when I checked in.And Doctor and nurse were friendly and attentive.
Thank you for the treatment."
1528,"Easy relaxed hike, hour up at a slow pace."
1529,"This place is so neat! There were so many varieties of veggies and herbs. I am not a flower person, but there were a lot of colorful flowers too. We are trying our second year of vegetable gardening and we are very excited about the starters we bought there!"
1530,"The loud food here is a must for steak.
Never had a bad meal here"
1531,Pricey
1532,"Burgers, beer, sports on tv, great breakfast option. Nice service."
1533,"We had a very pleasant experience at the Harbor 360 Hotel. The room was clean and comfortable with all the necessities. The balcony view of the harbor was incredible and made the whole night. We had booked a king size room and we were placed in a double queen bed room due to over-booking, but the staff were polite and professional about the mixup. The rooms were the same price at the end of the day so no big deal."
1534,A great place and open early on the weekends when others aren't.
1535,"It's remodeled store is so nice and fancy they have a good place to see them making your pizza they have a selection of drinks, salad, and cookie dough really think people should come here more often"
1536,The employees are very knowledgeable and helpful. Prices are reasonably priced as well plus they have veterans parking
1537,Not the greatest food!
1538,Had offerings of ribs on the day I came! Clean store!
1539,"Nice scenery, prompt ferry."
1540,Prime rib !!!!!
1541,"Great place for used building materials, and tools. Not great for donating they are not taking a lot of things. Good to know before you load up your truck and head there."
1542,Great to know where to find great office need's.
1543,Find all you need here
1544,Great views!!! Rooms were clean and my room was upgraded because the room i had they didn't have it ready.   This hotel does have room service which is always awesome! Front desk was friendly and helpful.. I would recommend this hotel for families with young children. O yeah before i forget there is  a rather small pool there as well.
1545,"We had dinner here and had high expectations given the reviews but most of the food was very average. The codfish burger was good but some of the other offerings were less than good.
The decor is something we saw a lot of in Alaska and took some getting used to, but they have a good collection of the taxidermied animals"
1546,Great atmosphere and great food. Perfect location. Good beer viewing nearby.
1547,"(Translated by Google) All Sitka is beautiful, the Visitor Center is a good option, provides good information and visiting you have the opportunity to see the flora and fauna in its best expression

1552,the best lunch one can get around here
1553,"Very fresh, very good... Definitely coming back here in the future"
1554,"You haven't had Alaskan king crab until you've had Tracy's Alaskan king crab. A pretty fun joint with tasty craft root beer. But their namesake is why you should go. This isn't some tourist trap with mediocre food... No, Tracy's served up the largest, tastiest king crab I've ever (EVER!) had. Oh yeah, and their bisque and crab cakes were to die for, but took up space that should have been filled with another massive crab leg! The wait was a bit lengthy, but that just gave us a little more time to rest our feet. Too bad I didn't try Tracy's until my second visit to Juneau, but I will be back... I can't wait to go back!"
1555,Decent dive. No aholes.
1556,Very disappointing. Drove 120 miles for a part that hadn't arrived yet. Won't have the part for another week often days. Would have been nice if I had been notified sooner.
1557,Awesome brewery with awesome beers on tap
1558,Lots of variety
1559,It is what it is
1560,"We have been coming here for several years for dinner and our anniversary. I always have been very happy with the food and service. This time was our anniversary and I can say the new ownership has really disappointed us with the changes. If your going to up your prices then you don’t make the portions smaller? And my halibut used to be excellent this time there was no crab topping? It was BURNT very dry and thin as can be,  ate it with difficulty!!!!! The salad was all stems and bitter the dressing had no favor. Hardly any veggies and mashed potatoes??? The waiter was great and he felt so bad about my halibut that he gave us free cheesecake. It would be nice to know that you charge 7$ for a beer Plus 2$ more for the 21oz????? Which is crazy. Also every extra on your Steak? Or etc is plus $2???? And your not told about this lol we didn’t even get the steak topping. So sorry to say we will not be coming back again."
1561,Great food and even better service.
1562,Awesome pizza!
1563,Good burgers of course. This location is the cleanest and fastest I have been too. The staff is always friendly and efficient.
1564,Best in Anchorage and everyone is super friendly!
1565,"Some of the highest quality to price ratio cannabis on the Anchorage market. The daily deals are a favorite, the budtenders are rad as well!"
1566,Good food and a busy brunch crowd made this a fun place to have some tasty eats. Portions were large and food was comfort style. An Anchorage institution.
1567,"friendly and helpful, remember to tip the tenders :)"
1568,Pretty place
1569,I've been to this place several times for lunch. I would highly recommend it. The food is excellent and the service great.

1571,Good selection of Auto Parts. They always have what I need in stock.
1572,Love it go back for more good service fast quick quick food
1573,This place is really something Soldotna was missing.  It is so delicious and freshly made on site daily.   Awesome!!
1574,Love to bowl
1575,"Need more employee's that know how to do more then stand around.

Everytime I go it's a horrible experience.
The only reason I keep going here is because when I order certain things this is the only location that has what I want.

But the 20 min wait for someone to come help me if they even show up is not worth it.

I had 3 different employees ask me if I needed help. Well I'm not just standing here for decoration.

All 3 employee's can't help me in the pickup department. Why is there only 1 person trained on how to unlock a locker and scan my items. And why is he never around.

The customer service has a line of about 12 people with only 1 cashier. Employee's walking past looking at her.
Very unorganized and unperfessional

This will be my last time ever coming to this store."
1576,Had a good time
1577,Great burger
1578,"Go on Wednesday for discounts. Also, very loud."
1579,Good variety & friendly staff. The owner is great. Let me use the restroom prior to store opening.

1586,Its good
1587,Good for breakfast.

1595,"Long story short, there was a major disturbance on the same floor which was on the other side of the building soon it moved to the hallway where shouting and yelling were very apparent five people fighting and choking each other pulling hair and all that, cops ended up being called, man being tased.

We had kindly asked for some type of refund or free option because of the disruption in the late night and their manager flat-out refused anything to compensate us for the terrible terrible terrible stay in their hotel."
1596,It was really yummy ❗🌮🌯
1597,Yummy ice cream with a great family atmosphere!
1598,Fine
1599,Fast friendly service.
1600,"This car wash does not clean well at all. I bought the mudblaster wash ($18) and windshield, headlights and entire rear of car was still filthy. Do not waste your money here. Also a Laser Wash does better."
1601,We love absolutely everything about this place we love the professionalism we love the fact that it is completely focused on children and their needs and they are very sensitive to whatever the child's needs are and my grandson absolutely loves going to the dentist and I would recommend this place to everyone for their children
1602,A great selection of goodies to make almost anything.
1603,Good to see movies before they are on video. ..
1604,"I'm here at midtown mall. I was going to go in to do some Christmas shopping, also I wanted to deal with some phone calls (safe place off the road also before shopping) this Parklot society pulls up and watches me. I feel that's rude. I would add a photo but it's not letting me.  So I'm just going to the next store since they are already treating me like a criminal. Sad having to dealing with coved then the stores are pushing costumers away."
1605,Awesome tours with awesome tour guides.
1606,Cool place
1607,"Love this place. Doc is amazing with animals and doesn't rx unnecessary treatment, vaccines or meds. Listens to you, takes his time with assessments and educating clients. Before landing in Alaska I traveled the US for work, with my animals. This is by far one of my favorite vets."
1608,"Quick, friendly staff and the Double Reindeer Burger was so good it was LIFE CHANGING!! Haha"
1609,went in there to have a bite to eat after the bars the was okay

1616,"Grateful for their patience, love, grace and respect"
1617,"Emmanuel was professional, friendly, and enjoyable to deal with. He took care of my situation quickly and was very clear in his suggestion on what needed to be done with one of my appliances. I'd gladly work with Reliable Appliance again in the future."
1618,Amazing and fast service! Staff very helpful and kind .
1619,"These guys rock.  Hello to everyone who enters, they work together to keep line moving.  Clean counter tops, cheery atmosphere."
1620,"This is a small, but cozy place.  The food is wonderful. The drinks are strong and delicious.  Service is excellent. Prices are reasonable.

1626,"Lost my crochet hat, amber, lilac, yellow lady like knit"
1627,"Alaskan owned and operated.
Alaskans serving Alaskans.

They have a great discount for Slopers and other businesses as well as military.

My husband bought some boots there for work. Upon getting home he realized they weren't steel toe and had zero issues getting a refund when we returned...on our way to the airport.

Broad selection. Reasonable prices for Alaska.

If you like to keep your money local, stop here first."
1628,"I have been using this shop for over 5 years. They do great work. No bs. No trying to get you to fix things that don't need to be done and do an excellent job of letting you know if they do find something else wrong with an accurate estimate of the costs.

Pricing is good as well. Usually on the lower end.

I don't take my vehicle anywhere else."

1631,It's McDonald's. They're all the same

1644,Friendly and very fair pricing.
1645,The best
1646,Scott was able to help get out some pretty tough pet stains. Customer service was A+
1647,"Can't beat the prices, but you get what you pay for, great staff though. Jennifer is my favorite."

1662,It was actually for a return which wasn't a problem had the receipt and the item in package which was taken back without question I would of put 5 but for the lack of having the right case in electronics that would fit my phone.
1663,"Nice selection of local and harder to find items- wormer, 5 way shots etc"
1664,Interesting....Could have been made more attractive for large no of Tourists visiting daily
1665,"We used to buy all our cat and dog food here, plus cat litter because of the rewards program. Unfortunately we decided to switch to Amazon monthly delivery because the prices were cheaper and we were tired of dealing with unfriendly staff and seeing bugs crawling around the store. They might think about exterminating the store to get rid of their bug problem."
1666,"I enjoy the hamburgers and fries here as much as most restaurants. The service at this location however was very apathetic. They were out of the cheese that was needed to make their special burger and offered no substitute. The special dessert, Très Lèches cake was light and refreshing. I ordered it with strawberries. My daughter ordered the brownie which was itself well made, but swimming in raspberry sauce. I wasn't necessarily upset upon leaving, but not impressed either."
1667,Everything you need for happy plants
1668,"Huge selection of flavors - You can customize your own flavor.

Owners are super friendly and very helpful."

1684,"Great service, Rates and Clean Rooms."
1685,You got to watch hlthem they won't give you your sources you paid for unless you ask for them and tell him you paid for them.

1687,Expensive but at least comfortable.
1688,I absolutely love Barnes and Noble. Greatest place on earth!

1695,"Great lounge area, nice clean rooms."
1696,Love ginger. Another great spot in Anchorage with Vegan/Vegeterian options.
1697,Location staff did not listen at all to what I ordered and served me something completely different. Not going back to that location unfortunately.
1698,We got a recommendation to try this restaurant from our guide Chris at Miller's Landing.  It did not disappoint.  Good food with a local flair.  No wait and a decent price.
1699,"Good food. Tables were small. Several corners were very dirty and need to be thoroughly cleaned. Chairs were adequate, but not great. Seating overall was cramped. Valley Hotel Cafe offers much more open space and is much cleaner."
1700,"Good portions, great food and options."
1701,This restaurant is always a treat and honestly a staple of fairbanks! Whether or you are choosing savory or sweet it is always a good choice. My favorite is the pizza crepe. The owner is very sweet and active in the restaurant. I suggest ordering the Cuban Coffee. It is unlimited refills and is just a perfect flavor for a savory crepe. Enjoy the food!
1702,The prices here are amazing - I just wish they had a way for non-stylists to open an account 😢
1703,Great clean rooms and courteous staff
1704,The employees tell you what you want and don't listen what you really want
1705,Food was great. service was above-average just forgot Waters the beginning that's all. The first table we sat at had a flickering light. they moved us without any problems. Would definitely go again.
1706,"Great receiving team)
Always a pleasure to deal with"
1707,"Well... if they could open on time I'd love this place 5stars. Good coffee. Nice ladies. Always late, no bueno.

Early is on time; on time is late, because late is unacceptable.

The cups; the queens. Read the cups. However, coffee needs served at 06:00 hrs, daily! Beyond being late raisers it's a spectacular stop."
1708,Very friendly
1709,Great food. Friendly service.
1710,Fantastic
1711,The place is nice but the clerks don't know anything about the phones they are selling.
1712,"U rock,thanks for the dog treats.great coffee"

1715,Service was fast and courteous and the sandwiches were fantastic. Very homey feel to it.
1716,Great place to stop and walk around.
1717,Food was good and there server was very professional. The remodel from TJI Fridays is a better layout.
1718,We eat there when we go to Anchorage.
1719,"Honestly I'm the pickiest person about hair. My wife refers to me as a poodle. This place truly does deserve 5-stars because of their customer service. There is a lady there by the name Kim and she does my hair exactly how I like it. It's almost like she knows what I'm saying before I say it. There's another guy there I think his is Brian who today just trimmed up around the edges and in the back of the neck, but he did such a good job faiding it that I'm still really impressed. As I was paying the tab I couldn't help but laugh. I had to make a comment. I just said I've paid a lot more for haircuts I don't like. Needless to say it  wonderful place, very affordable, and I highly recommend it."
1720,Great little bar right on the water. Bring cash because they don't do credit cards
1721,"Went there for lunch and it was pretty good. I got the ""I Love Yellowtail"" roll and the price was pretty decent. They definitely did not skimp on the fish either. Buddy got the ""Alaskan Roll"" and it was pretty big. I had to help him finish. Other buddy got the ""Beef Yakisoba"" so there is something for everyone. Highly recommend for someone looking for a sushi style lunch."
1722,"Very nice bread, free samples, friendly service. Would be five stars if the prices were about 20% lower."
1723,"Got a good deal on running boards but they had to get them from another store and schedule the installation.  When I went to have them installed it was supposed to be an hour, but it was only 30 minutes or so and they look great."
1724,Great !!!
1725,Great sandwiches !!!👍👍

1734,Excellent food.  Amazing spice.
1735,Knowledgeable guys and very helpful in a nice shop
1736,Just went here for coffee.....worth it.
1737,Great German food. A hidden gem of Anchorage!!!!
1738,"Horrible assistant manager, Haley needs to learn how to help assist customers and not just tell them no. The Wasilla warehouse has it right!"
1739,"One of my faves. They have as great poké salad, and I love their hard seltzers"
1740,Typical McDonald's. Always have to wait for them to make coffee! But the cheeseburgers are always ready.
1741,Great wholesale warehouse with a little bit of everything.
1742,Very helpful staff. Great stay
1743,"Wow very impressed. I live and travel all over Alaska for work. I am always having food delivered to my hotel room which is usually Ho Hum. Asiana Gardens delivered quickly and food was not only hot, but was very good as well. They did good here. From the delivery person to the quality and quantity of the food. Plenty of napkins,forks and other condiments which others forget.  You always take a gamble when ordering Sushi for delivery, But Asiana Gardens was as if I was sitting right at the Sushi Bar. The seaweed wraps on my rolls were crisp and not soggy with the fish being fresh as well.
Well Done Asiana Gardens. You are my go to place now when in Juneau for Chinese and Sushi."
1744,This is a solid local diner and the only one of its kind in town. Basic diner food and reliable service. Coffee refills and generous portions. You know the drill. An old standard that we love!
1745,"We will never go anywhere else to buy a matters ever again. Great selection and wonderful, knowledgeable staff. Thanks."
1746,Really like their 5 dollar Friday deals... Awesome  deli ... really enjoy the Steakhouse Onion Cheese... they seem to always sell out of this flavor.. plus really enjoy the 5 dollar Express Chinese meal
1747,"Always a good experience. Very nice employees.

Edit: I still love the convenience of this place being so close to my work and the people are great. Just a little bit frustrating that I take a 30 min break and head there in less than a minute for a coffee and wait in line for 15 to 20 minutes almost every time. If you're in a time crunch pre order and go inside."
1748,"Port of Valdez is very popular, so you'll see boats and ships of all sizes.  Most likely the largest size ships are carrying oil from the Alyeska Pipeline.  Fishing boats are very active especially during the summer.  Fishing from the banks for Pink Salmon is very popular.

1752,Service slow & when ordering seams they left my burger off....food set under lights over five minutes....you may consider hiring more staff
1753,Great service
1754,"Very nice museum well organized and covering a wide range of topics. To me the most impressive was the native culture exhibits. I would have wished for a little more lights on some exhibits, even some activated by the viewer. But the information provided were clear and relevant."
1755,"ER is great, I've never had an issue, and never had to wait longer than a few minutes to be seen.  Check-in/Billing is tedious, especially when nothing had changed in years that needed to be reported.  They still had to ask the same questions over and over.  I utilized their lab during off hours, and check-in is in the ER after hours (5pm!).  This worked well for a while, but the ER is very obviously not helpful with checking in with the lab draws.  I waited 2 hours one time for just a lab draw because of ER triage and the ungodly long check-in process.  I must say though, they are fast....it's just a long process.  I stopped using their lab when I found out I can have the same tests done in 10 minutes at Quest.  Sadly though, my midnight blood draws are over.  I had surgery here!  It turned out well.  The doctor was a total jerk, but if you bring someone with you, they turn into saints.  (Just a helpful tip).  Being closest to me, I go there in an emergency, but generally, their doctors are rude, with bedside manner issues.  Ortho?  Forget it!  They're complete #$&holes.  I don't know why?  I think that they think they are God or something.  I had a terrible experience with a urologist there, he was SO rude I almost walked out.  He obviously didn't like anyone that was ""un-pure"".  I was chastised for decisions I made in my life 25 YEARS AGO!  Completely and utterly rude.  Ears Nose Throat doc was awesome though!  It's hit or miss there... Glad to see they partnered with Mayo tho!  The clinic, not the condiment.  d;-)"
1756,"Nice atmosphere and good food, an almost fancy place for dinner in the valley"

1778,"The only campground we stay at when in Delta. Not large, not fancy but has a comfortable feel to it.  It's in town and an IGA grocery store that is amazing. We have a 31 foot motorhome and can park in any of the campsites. There is designated tent sites as well. A clean and maintained camp that is $15 a night,  which is average for a dry camp here in Alaska. Stop by if you can.
Enjoy"
1779,Me and the pup walk past this lake some times she takes a dip can be busy place in the summer.
1780,"The store has really great employees, but suffers from poor management. If you have rescue dogs take them to a different groomer. The retail side is always helpful and polite, though and I recommend them for shopping 100%"

1785,I feel that half the items I needed immediately were over priced. Nice clean environment
1786,Honestly ive been there multiple times over the years i wanna say its a great place because it is especially for the locals but if your not local and just passing through it would be like a great watering whole for you .
1787,"It was okay, typical fast food.  Items were missing from the order, the pop machine wasn't dispensing the proper mixture of drinks."

1808,Great atmosphere!
1809,Pretty view but not much else in the park unless you have small kids.
1810,The only big theater in Anchorage that sells real gummy bears at the concessions.

1813,Very helpful
1814,Best breakfast service in town for a cafeteria.  The regular breakfast cook is a legend.
1815,"Tasty sammiches.  I can always find something for me to eat here.  GF and V selections, if one is into that.  ""They"" tell me (unsolicited, of course) that they come here frequently for non meat and non gluten options.  Then they tell me they crossfit, and where to go for that, too.  I just want my turkey sammich with that awesome spread, thank you."

(Original)
Die schnellste Möglichkeit auf den Berg zu kommen um die schöne Aussicht über Juneau zu genießen...allerdings ist die Fahrt mit knapp 33$ auch ziemlich teuer..."
1824,Best sushi in Anchorage hands down
1825,"Has a nice vibe to it. You know how McDonald's helped create Chipotle, it feels like QDOBA is the Burger King of Mexican fast food. Especially because it has Impossible meat."
1826,"Stopped here during a road trip to Chicken, Alaska. Great photo opportunities as it sits in the center of Tok, Alaska. The line for the restroom 🚻 can be kind of long, so hopefully you don't have to go REALLY BAD when you get there. Snacks and curiosities for all types of travelers who stop in."
1827,"(Translated by Google) A very quaint park. There were many play equipment for children to play, and there were many children. The impression that the locomotive which goes around the garden was crowded. Pioneering age? The shop street that reproduced the townscape of is very nice.

(Original)
とても趣のあるパーク。子供の遊ぶ遊具が充実しており、子連れが多かった。園内をぐるり一周する機関車が混んでいた印象。開拓時代？の町並みを再現したショップ通りはとても素敵です。"
1828,Cool ppl. Good prices and goods.
1829,Cute place with good tea options and lots of baked goods
1830,Neat place
1831,"We went for breakfast on a weekday. They have a huge and somewhat creative breakfast menu, but also all the traditionals. Service wasn't the fastest but it was sufficient. The food was very good, with huge-sized proportions. The prices had seemed a speck high, but then I saw the proportions so it seemed more reasonable. The furniture has seen better days. But it was truly tasty food so I do recommend this place for breakfast."
1832,Better than subway for sure
1833,"Real nature!   Very, very good place!"

1846,They have good cinemas and awesome staff! Movies are great there
1847,Always impressed by the food and service.
1848,"This place will treat you nice until you go to pick up your vehicle. After waiting an hour just to shake the hand of the person who sold me the truck online I finally get to see it and see it had not been washed. Then I got in and found kid toys and empty cigarette packs showing me they didn't bother cleaning the inside of the truck either. I sit there for a few min looking it over to get familiar with the dash and controls since they felt that hour I sat on their couch was better spent doing nothing. I start the truck up to find out the tank is half empty. You would think when you spend over $47,000 for a truck it should be clean and have a full tank of fuel. When my temp tags were about to expire I called up and asked about my new plates. I was told they were there waiting for me to pick up. No one decided to let me know. Since I live on an island in Alaska I told them they better hurry and send me the plates since they didn't bother to tell me they were in or send them out as soon as they got them. They had my full address and instructions from when I bought the truck. But I guess that is not how this place does business. I'd look elsewhere for a vehicle. They are nice until they have your money."
1849,"Good location, recently renovated.  Hotel has no laundry facilities for guests (closest laundromat is about a 25 minute walk)."
1850,One of the best Mexican restaurants in Alaska.

1866,"Great selection, etc."
1867,"Everything was alright until I received my dinner...  I ordered a prime rib dinner, the potato was cold but there was a HAIR wrapped in my steak!  I told the staff and the owner was told and never even came to my table.  The waiter ASKED me if i wanted to have it written off my ticket! OMG! really?!  I took one bite and almost threw up seeing that hair wrapped in my steak...  NEVER NEVER will i go there again.  All the owner had to do was come and say, ""Im sorry about that...."" but nothing even close to customer service....  You lost two people and trust me, i will let others know as well...."
1868,Representatives are helpful on what you are looking for.
1869,"The best Auto body shop.
They always do great work

1870,The best chinese food in the state.
1871,You have to visit the Homer Spit.
1872,"Great staff, Bacon jam burger is great, loaded tots!"
1873,Wow what a place! I loved all the things on the walls I love the decorations I was amazed at how quick we were seated even though they said it was a long waiting list it didn't take as long as we thought it would. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and the food was outstanding!☆☆☆☆☆
1874,I absolutely love this place the staff is extremely knowledgeable very kind and outgoing overall a great group of people and the only smoke shop I go to
1875,The Home Improvement specialists are always helpful and friendly. They do have the uncanny ability to decipher exactly what I needed. Lowe's also seems to consistently have the products I need.
1876,Best place for coffee
1877,The dressing room does not have the best customer service but all other areas are great.
1878,"Stayed for 3 weeks. I lost something during my stay. Something that required batteries. But I never brought it up. Because, well because. Breakfasts were pretty decent, and staff was perfectly nice. No sarcasm there, they were genuinely nice."
1879,Great parts and price very knowledgeable
1880,Hard to find items!
1881,Decent burgers. Atmosphere was really nice too

1883,Fun for all. Beautiful scenery great warm water
1884,My kids can play for hours. It's clean and well maintained. There is plenty of parking and bathrooms. On the far side is a small dock for small non motorized boats. Thanks for the amazing park!
1885,"I just came from picking up my order. Not good. The fried rice was not fried rice, it looked like Spanish rice and tasted nothing like Asian fried rice. The pho was weak on the protein and it tasted bland as well. This by far the worst experience I've had on Asian takeout. Sorry, Pho Leana East needs to level up and do better. Sincerely One less customer."
1886,"Delicious taste of Alaska!  The fish and local craft brews were not only tasty, but also reasonably priced.  Wonderful experience."
1887,"I really enjoyed this place and visited twice during my vacation. It is a nicer but casual feel. The staff is friendly and communicated thoroughly on menu items.

I liked the Shrimp and Lobster Ravioli and Seafood Chowder most. My boyfriend had the crab legs, which I also tried. I prefer a more cajun style crab leg, but these were indeed ginormous! I didn't care for the crab much but my ravioli was 10/10. People seem to come here more for alcoholic drinks than dinner though, as everyone around me had a glass of wine or some other drink, with a salad or light meal.

My only complaints about this place are that the bathroom is extremely weird and annoying to access and the VERY wide price ranges. My ravioli was under $20, as were the other two pastas without meat, but you'll find items in the 30's and 40's range. The crab legs we tried we're $95 which I thought was a bit ridiculous."
1888,"Are you kidding me, primerib - GCB just went primetime!"
1889,Best homemade tortillas I’ve found in Anchorage.
1890,New bumper cars and laser tag available now too.

1897,The delicious pizza and a fun environment make for a great place to share a drink with friends!
1898,It was a nice place. They had more stuff than I thought they would. Very friendly staff too.
1899,The only real reason why it's not a five star is because to use the bathrooms you have to pay someone to get a code thing but after you do I'm sure you get access to the dryers and washers but other that that it's a great place to stay with a rv or whatever your rockin. And the whole place in general looks really nice
1900,Good
1901,"Fun, great food, and wide variety of vendors."
1902,"Good food, pleasant waitress. Very clean restrooms."
1903,Found the part i needed was the correct part and worked the first time

1908,Beautiful place. Amazing view of the mountains. Even the air is amazing.

1911,Good food and great staff
1912,Super great service! The employees didn't hesitate to let me try out different bikes and helped me compare all the options within my price range. I ended up purchasing and even after I paid they continued to offer me honest advice and help. Will be mine and my wifes new bike shop! Thanks again guys!
1913,Needed stuff
1914,Great place to go with family. Buffet style is economical and there are very many options for whatever you may like.
1915,"A great theater, sure it's a little less flashy than some of the other theaters in town. But the picture quality is great and all the movies are 4$. A pretty great deal if you ask me"
1916,"IHOP in Anchrage Tikahnu Commons. It was busy, but had a short 5 min wait. The service was excellent and all staff were friendly and helpful. The food was cooked perfectly and the only downside was how long it took to get the meals we ordered due to busy place."
1917,Long wait but worth every minute of it. Food is always on point!
1918,Bought a really nice couch for a relatively decent price 👌
1919,Its a busy atmosphere. Lots of books. The strabucks is ok. At the music swction they used to have headphones where yoy could sample the music. Then there was a headphone less part where you could just press a button
1920,Been twice in the last three months. Both times I received an incomplete order.  However the food was so good I didn't care! Five stars for the cook!

1926,Excellent service and pricing for your tires. Go visit!
1927,👍🏻
1928,"Sushi is okay. Bibimbap is meh. Katsu is meh. My friend ordered Nagasaki udon and it was horrible. I don't even know what a chef even wanted to make it taste like. Champon? I don't know.lol It's not that I don't want to go back, but I do not need to go back."
1929,Carl's Jr. Is always bomb.
1930,Billy is a fantastic barber and the shop has a laid back vibe.
1931,"Its a Denny's, serves was good, food was ok."

1933,Good pot pies
1934,Its Michael's. Has most of your crafting needs.
1935,It is gas station. Not sure what else I should say in review about gas station.
1936,Good stuff there
1937,"small selection,but wonderful staff,very helpfull"
1938,"A place that's a pretty long drive from Fairbanks.  In the winter the road can be dangerous, so be careful.  The main attraction is the ""hot spring"". Though there is a spring on the premises,  the water is actually pumped into the rock pool from the spring.regardless, its not a bad way to spend the day.  The pool and indoor hot tubes are pretty lame, so just use the outside pool. There are lockers available for $.50 each use, and they're pretty small so dont bring any unnecessary items.  Plan to spend at least half a day here.  The food at the restaurant is like everything else in Alaska, pretty expensive.  So eat there at your own risk to your wallet.  Never stayed there, so I can't comment on the rooms, but the prices are up there.  There have other activities as well, just be ready to pay out for them.  All in all, not a bad way to spend a half to full day."
1939,"Wonderful, super involved park!"
1940,"Great place friendly and knowledgeable staff.
I shop here often. Plus much better prices
than Kenai feed!"
1941,"The Movie was excellent !) Staff was exceptional and helpful and accommodating. Seat were wonderful, sound quality was immersive. Then you can't beat, the perfect movie on the big screen!
Four stars because the popcorn wasn't what it used to be, hot buttery goodness that melts in your mouth.
I miss my favorite greeter, that helped with all pertinent information 😥"

1949,Catelyn is awesome. I only went for waxings but I never had a bad experiance. Keep an eye out for new year deals and pfd specials
1950,I loved this place
1951,"Zero stars.......the ""bulgogi"" was absolutely not bulgogi and tasted like the meat had turned. The rice for the sushi was not sushi rice and severely under cooked and fell apart when picked up. We were the only people in the restaurant and it took almost an hour to get our food. Super disappointed because it's a cute place."
1952,Excellent inventory and very congenial staff.
1953,Rooftop is awesome
1954,Food just like momma made.
1955,"Have had mostly good experiences here. I was renting from the ""box"" movie machine and the last time I went there the electricity was out.
No big deal. Everyone took it in stride.
I couldn't return the movies through no fault of there's.
I commented where I drove from to which an employee who sometimes works at other locations said ""So did I. Hmmppff.""
Good for you Mister. Difference is I paid to go out there. Unlike him who got paid to be at his place of employment. Come to think of it, haven't seen him since."
1956,Great food pretty pricey

1967,Great customer service.
1968,"I've never been disappointed in the food here, even though it is a bit pricey for thr experience of sharing a table with strangers (unless you bring a group large enough to fill a table). But the amount of time between being seated and when the chef shows up to cook is ridiculous and makes me dread going here most the time. Also, the service in general can be iffy, though the chefs have always been on point."
1969,"The only problem is the prices, but you're getting what you pay for.
Every meal here is delicious. Portion size is great. Drink selection is great.
Events are very fun here too."
1970,"Great place will def go back. Very truthful workers, amazing experience."

Just get a sixer and watch netflix."
1974,It's amazing that such a small town has a great place like this.
1975,Best food and best service. I enjoyed.
1976,All you need
1977,"Oh man the environment at the rooftop was amazing, staff is friendly, the venue is so great for meetups, not to mention a bar at the rooftop. It's so fun, I'm definitely coming back."
1978,Quiet and Peaceful
1979,I am so thankful for Mike and the crew at The Bicycle Shop on Dimond! I rely on them and trust them to fix my bike quickly and competently and they do so EVERY TIME! that's why I'm a return customer since 2012!! ❤👍
1980,good monthly all you can wash deal
1981,Great store
1982,"This is maybe the best local business I've ever been to. Definitely the best bottle shop in Alaska. The have the selection, they have the knowledge. Prices are reasonable but you don't even consider them in light of the joyful experience of being able to buy singles of beers that you've never seen anywhere else."
1983,One of the best around. Always packed with customers.
1984,"Long lines, ok food, there are better options out there"
1985,"I hate that I keep going back!!  We have had the same experience with Christmas trees.  $150.00 is a lot for a Christmas tree in the first place, and then to go through the hassle of undecorating the redecorating and being treated as if we had been abusive to the tree, especially when 4 others there were also returning trees. Sadly, for the last 6 years we have had an artificial tree.  I end up going back after I swear I will never return. I have to agree with the other bloggers that the staff at both the Cranberry and DeArmoun Rd locations are about the rudest retailers in town. The problem is that they are the only retailers of products that I do enjoy, See's candy being one of them. I used to take my fuchsias (6 baskets) and begonias (4 baskets) there to winter over. I also used to order annual baskets. I did so for 3 years, paid in the fall. Then one year I went to pick them up and they were hosing them down before they were just left for me to carry to my truck. When I looked at my favorite pink marshmallow (besides the fact that it looked so sickly it should have been thrown away) it was covered, I mean covered in aphids. When I looked at the other plants I found them to be close to the same. I had to stand back in line and was rudely told that ""that was why they were hosing them off!! There is a aphid problem this year"". I asked about why were they not treated chemically and was told that they didn't use chemicals. Grrrrrr that is what I thought I was paying for!!! I was upset and refused the worst of the 12 baskets (I had 28 new tea roses that I did not need to have exposed the infestation) but was informed that I would still have to pay for them. They did offer to replant the annual baskets that were supposed to ""match"" but looked as if there was a 2 month growth difference, also insect infested. I did end up with constant treatment of malathion that year, but for the amount of $$$ that I had to pay I would have expected better service for both my plants and a customer. Maybe the sales staff should be on commission, they would be more helpful and friendly. Oh... btw, the ""back staff"" has always very pleasant and helpful, although it is helpful that I can speak Spanish :-)"
1986,Good selection. Buy 1 get 50% off 2nd pair promotion right now.
1987,"Homemade corned beef hash was so yummy.  My man's pancakes and sausage was big portions, also yummy.
Bring cash, they don't take cards.  They do have an atm machine, but with a fee of course.  Will go back again."
1988,A lot of effort went into the creation of this visitor center and I think most people will find it a worth while stop on their journey through Alaska. While there we walked the trails and found them well maintained and interesting.
1989,Clean and we'll kept. Dogs on leashes.
1990,"Good fries, I'll go back again and try breakfast sometime"
1991,"$6 Bucks For All Day Pass! This Place Has It All, Its Totally Worth it!!"
1992,If you want the Midas touch go to Midas. If you want your vehicle fixed go elsewhere.
1993,Awesome place for a group or family or even alone the food is ok the scallops could be bigger and the drinks are awesome
1994,"Lots of fun, great drinks and it's chill."
1995,Great staff.
1996,Loved the food and the staff. Have never had a bad experiance at this location.
1997,"Pikes Landing has a good selection of beer, and it has an amazing view of the river. You can also play a spendy game at their driving range, at a $1 per ball but it's kind of fun, especially when you land one on the green across the river. Service is good, except when things get busy. Then it's probably up to you to flag down your (probably overworked?) server. I spent a whole day here waiting for my evening flight at the airport. It's a pleasant place."
1998,Really relaxing

2027,"Friendly  helpful folks, one of my favorite Safeway stores in the Golden Heart♡"
2028,We go often. Buy a punch card! We've gone threw a few in a couple of years. Definitely worth it and always had great interactions with the staff. With a group of kids or just one it's always a good time.

2030,Like going with the family

2032,It's a car wash. Doesn't use brushes so it won't snap off antennas
2033,Like it
2034,Good sandwiches and sides on a budget.
2035,"The service was slow, both for the fact that it took a while for them to take out order, then there were at least four orders placed after us that got served before we did.  The extra chicken nachos that I got had an actual scarcity of chicken.  Overall not up to par with other Taco Bell locations."
2036,"Beautiful park with a diverse range of activities. Small sports fields as well as competitive stadiums, great disc golf course, tons of walking biking and skiing trails, and much more!"
2037,Mermaid scramble with assorted meats was awesome.
2038,Food over here should not be this pricey. I do like the Rustic Goat logo... its like a Satanic bar.
2039,"Pulled up to this place at 4:50pm. They changed my oil, air filter, and checked the van over. I was out the door at 5:10pm. My company has an account here which is nice. As the employee I just walk in and the bill is forwarded to my company. You guys do great!!!"

2054,Excellent breakfast burritos
2055,"How can I describe such a wondrous, natural beauty? Everywhere you look it is so picturesque. I felt like I was almost in a different time while walking through the forest. Everything is so green! There are so many beautiful shades of green end the Fallen trees and overgrowth makes the forest appear like it is full of Modern Art or statues! Around each turn was a new, beautiful experience. It is definitely a place I recommend people visit, not only for its natural beauty, but for its spirituality and peacefulness. If you get a chance to steal a few moments to yourself, simply stop and listen to the birds chirping or the sound of the water lapping against the shore, the wind whistling through the trees, and just breathe. Then, and only then will you understand what a true blessing it is to be in such a beautiful place!"
2056,Bike hike beach frisbee golf black bears moose porkypine😏 cell coverage beautiful trees fun on a really windy day in the woods check it out
2057,"Their rates are expensive, though it is something that can be fitted into a budget once a quarter if you are frugal."

2063,Great place

2075,Best coffee on earth
2076,"Nothing wrong with Super Bear, it's a decent grocery store and it carries a few things I can't get elsewhere. That said, if I can get something elsewhere, I do; there are frankly better places in town to shop."
2077,"Great Pizza, good Vibe."
2078,Time will tell if this little Italian gem will prosper.  This is their third location in the span of 6 years.  Wishing them the best.
2079,Great visit. You get alot of history during the tour.
2080,Nice place
2081,"We went on the Orca Tour. Was absolutely amazing. I've never seen my favorite creature in the wild before and these guys made it possible. There werent any orcas around resurrection bay, so they took us out a bit farther until we found some. Definitely worth the price. Best day of my life."
2082,Hoonah and Icy Strait were hands down a favorite. Several dining and entertainment options while in port. Saw a TON of whales and sea life right from shore!
2083,Always helpful and they try to save you money if you're in a tight spot!
2084,Great place to watch planes take off and land while sipping a cold beverage

2086,Fries were extra salty. The rest was great
2087,Great tasting wings!
2088,Fun place to swim and fish
2089,"Mostly a great experience with a few opportunities to improve. Loved the atmosphere and everyone working there. EXCELLENT wine list and beer selection. We had sparkling Rose and grapefruit sour beer, all excellent. Loved the lemon rice soup - very filling. Loved both halibut sandwiches. Could improve kids menu and the pasta. Kids menu: portions were very very small. I know kids are also small but ours can eat a whole steak so we had to order two orders of pasta. Also, the burger is a slider with a crusty bun that is so big a kid can't eat it. I tried scooping out the bread but by that point the kiddo was too upset. The pasta says it's in a light lemon cream sauce - the emphasis should be on lemon! Had the lemon been halved I could have eaten more but it was just too overwhelming. I would have liked to taste the garlic! Looks like they might have live bands and they have outside seating. Overall, we really liked it."
2090,"Good food, good service"
2091,Great place to get a burger to go.
2092,"Nice location, good service. The food is good but not great. It's a nice place to meet with friends, and the view is tremendous! The servers are always friendly and helpful, and the food is okay, but nothing I long for after I have gone home."
2093,Recently watched Angel Has Fallen and it was great👍🏾
2094,Always got the good stuff
2095,"(Translated by Google) To be honest, if there is no special complex, it is really not worth taking a picture this far. You can feel the Doton Highway along the way.

说实话，如果没有什么特别的情结，真的不值得拍这么远来拍一个照。沿途可以感受一下道顿公路。"

2101,Good food!  Michael the server was excellent as well!
2102,Great service and friendly faces all around. Consistently qualty bbq and the sides are wonderful including the baked beans. Can't go wrong with a pulled pork sandwich w/ Mac n Cheese & Baked Beans and top it off with cornbread and sweet tea.
2103,The best Thai food in town. I wish I could eat it every day! My favorite take out option in Anchorage.
2104,Enjoyed the time there & its always great to make the bartenders laugh with a joke or 2.
2105,"Good place, prices seemed a little higher than usual."
2106,Sloppy service. Poorly wrapped burritos. The food doesn’t taste bad but it’s clearly prepared with low effort.
2107,"Great Cobb salad,  fresh and plenty of food"
2108,"This store is always clean and well stocked. Best time to go is between noon and four in the afternoon, you will have the store just for you. There are always Taxis parked at the entrance ready to take you anywhere. Restroom are nice and clean. You can eat at  Mc Donald's with your cart."
2109,Just like every other Costco
2110,"Good service, fair prices.  The only tire shop into my family uses."

2112,Very pleasant ferry ride from Skagway to Haines and back.
2113,Great Alaskan Historic Hotel
2114,I love it here
2115,"Your typical Walmart, employee's don't know where anything is at. Only have a few check outs open. While you see 3 to 8 employees just standing there and not opening more lanes"
2116,"Great beer, great food, and great views!"
2117,Nice park
2118,"Great food, excellent service and our waiter was amazing.  Great Place!"
2119,"Crunchwrap is always not closed and found enough ingredients inside of it, orders on doordash also and the flats quesadilla that we received was as flat as paper and all the ingredients were on one side. Go to this one often and the order always has something we don't like about it."
2120,The food is great! And so are the people who work there!
2121,"If you like good beer and pizza, this is the place you want to be."

2135,Great place to take your kids
2136,People work their are friendly and kind
2137,Fantastic place for sledding with small kids!
2138,"Dirty interior, broken seats, no high chairs for kids, mirror next to table had a dried sneeze on it. The pho was not very good either. Very sweet broth, and probably the murkiest broth I've ever had in a pho. I ordered the raw beef pho, but the broth was not hot enough to cook it through, it was an odd color of dark red and bunched up like trimmings off an old steak rather than neat slices like it is traditionally done. Service was pretty good though. 2/10 would not eat again."
2139,Box store. Has good plants in the spring that are better priced than Home Depot
2140,"Great service, great informative, kind employees, fast service, sturdy installation. Super nice folks and competitive pricing. Will be back !"
2141,Very professional and always offer help
2142,It's expensive tho
2143,"Simard Automotive is a top notch shop. I had multiple issues with an old Volvo and they were the only shop in town with the code reader to accurately diagnose the problems. All were true professionals and the customer service can’t be beat. Will definitely return if/when I have any more troubles with the car. Highly recommended, you will be satisfied with the experience!"
2144,Everything is yum.
2145,"Great place to take the family for snow tubing! Reasonable prices ($16 per person for 1.5 hrs of tubing), loads of fun!"
2146,The staff is very nice and helpful. The doctors take time for your needs. Their food is decent and the wait is not that long. All the staff has ate their food and they say it's good. The medical care is good. So all in all it's a decent place.
2147,I always find what I'm looking for
2148,Been eating there for 26 years what does that tell you
2149,"Amazing service great options. They have a wide range of ingredients for your taste, and the espresso they make is on point! They always have a special crepe of they day, go check it out!"
2150,"Never a dull moment here. This place is huge and has about everything imaginable, it seems."
2151,Walked the 10 mile trail and seen nothing. Earthquake park has 4 signs to read and that's it. Not worth your time.
2152,Love their ice cream and friendly people!
2153,It's a Starbucks!
2154,"The people and atmosphere here are great. By far, one of the best sit-down restaurants in Fairbanks!"
2155,"Being one of the only places open near my work I have been going most week days, and its almost always the same guys, both super chill and helpful, probably my favorite subway so far."
2156,"Growing up near Omaha in Nebraska it's hard to find food quality with down home comfort food. This is the best I've had outside of the Midwest. Nothing beats fresh pan fried chicken! Slaw and rings are pretty hard to beat also. Opt for the corn muffins over the rolls. Little bit of fresh ground salt on the chicken, a meal you won't forget... In one of the seafood capitals of the world."
2157,"I liked this place, one because it has a small menu to choose from and they do it good. Two, the drinks here are pretty good, and they have five dollar margaritas, can't beat that! The food here was really good, the sandwiches are solid, and stone oven pizzas are tasty. Make sure you try the truffle fries! You won't be disappointed I swear! The only thing that is wrong with the restaurant is that there isn't much seating room."
2158,Service
2159,Really helpful
2160,"Decent stock of art supplies, prices are a little high, however if you sign up for there web site they have Great coupons to drop those prices way down!😊"
2161,No words can describe how awesome this place is for a beginner jeweler such as myself. I found everything and more from this place and I will surely return
2162,Pull tabs and pool tables.  Lots of the older locals hang out here.
2163,So thankful for this store!  My hubby loves the guns and fishing gear...and camping stuff.  I love it for the kids stuff and sports gear.  Delta is blessed to have this store!!
2164,Awesome place for the children to come and explore
2165,"They did some great work swapping over the tires for the oncoming winter weather. Of course I misinterpreted what studded tires actually looked like and imagined some huge spikes, but that's just my bad. That should be an option though...😉"
2166,"There are picnic tables, fire pits, and toilets at the trailhead. Bring weather appropriate gear, ~the weather changes quickly, bug dope ~the mosquitos are relentless, and a sack for fiddlehead ferns, blueberries, and rosehips."
2167,"Nice selection of natural and organic goods. Good variety of produce for being in such a small footprint. The only place to find some things. Prices are usually reasonable, and there are regularly pretty good sales on a rotating selection of items, so it behooves you to pay attention to the flyers."
2168,It's always a pleasure going there always have fun so you should try and if you've been there you know what I mean much love happy Easter

2174,Yes very good prepared Deli meals
2175,Celebrating Recovery has helped me redeem my self worth.
2176,The expanse and shear natural beauty make you feel like you're deep in the wilderness even though you're inside city limits. They have a huge network of trails for running dog walking or whatever you would like nestled all over the hills. There is also a disc golf course that is rather challenging. And of course everybody knows the ski area in the winter time. A beautiful safe place to take the family and enjoy some wilderness for the afternoon!
2177,Meat was spoiled 😖
2178,Nice
2179,best pizza we've ever had!
2180,"Only reason for 4 stars and not 5, I checked out the park before I had to catch my flight back home and within less than 5 mins of me and 2 other folks who arrived in the same time, some asshat from a local towing company came by like he was going to start towing our vehicles.  myself and another person stared him down and waited until he left.  Not very hospitable for your tourists Anchorage at 10:40 in the morning on a Saturday."
2181,Due to Colony Christmas was very busy and slightly disorganized. But altogether not bad
2182,Still closed to public until further notice
2183,"I went looking for a queen bed and found just what I was looking for. Kin helped me out, answered all of my questions, and got me checked out in minutes."
2184,"Walmart is Walmart, can't beat prices selection or service . Best"
2185,Really cool. Never expected to ever be able to see a living Snow Leopard but they had 2 there!
2186,"The nachos and cheesecurds are legit 🤩 so good! The service was great too, thanks Dana!"
2187,"The two lady's. Who working,  and own,  the place. Both, are, very friendly.  Courteous.  Smiling.  Make, customers. Feeling, home. BLESSINGS,  for them. It's, a good family. Business."
2188,Had a flat fixed for $16.00 and it is going down again.
2189,Fun and friendly  awesome bar tender as well
2190,Still the number one dispensary I go to I love their point reward systems this is their rewards are top like freaking awesome there supply and their prices are way better than they were on the streets LOL love cannabaska
2191,"Massive burgers..that were cooked to perfection.  They are not cheap. $15.00 per burger with a side. But they could easily be shared.  My wife and I each got one and neither of us were able to finish it. The upside we both had lunch the next day.
If your out this way take the time to stop.  They are AWESOME."
2192,"Why do they make the food with little to no meat, tomatoes, etc. and over put cheese n sour cream."
2193,Best Thai food  in Anchorage!?
2194,Very crafty place.  A little scattered around but great quality products and helpful staff
2195,"(Translated by Google) Highly recommended, we could not cross the river with the basket due to an accident but it must be very cool.

(Original)
Molt recomanable, no vem poder creuar el riu amb la cistella per algun accident però ha de ser molt xulo."
2196,"Customer service was great, she even saved me extra cash."
2197,Awesome treasures!! I love the surprise bags!
2198,A local donut staple here in Anchorage for as long as I can remember. Tasty donuts of a large variety! Open 24/7.
2199,It was fantastic.
2200,A store for tourists. Over priced and outdated food. Dates changed or repackaged but still sold at gourmet prices. Many people get sick from their deli. Just because it is fresh cooked doesnt mean it hasnt been outdated for some time. Especially the rotisserie chicken.
2201,Always amazing food!
2202,They are willing to work with you and your financial situation.
2203,"Actually homemade diner food, a favorite for everything from their chicken tenders to meatloaf ."
2204,"Good service; attentive. Meal was nice with excellent mussels as an appetizer. Go, you'll be pleased."
2205,Great coffee shop that has great gelato.
2206,Good place four big get togethers
2207,Nothing much to see here
2208,Best prime steak and eggs
2209,It depends on the people that are working
2210,"For the only movie theater within 50 miles its good. Usually lines or a long wait for concessions and movie theater tends to be cold (as they all tend to be). Employees are 9 times out of 10 nice and courteous. Rewards program is nice as well.
IMAX is not as nice as other the others I’ve been to."
2211,Take great care of the animals and tell me the correct information
2212,"Ordered a computer Nov. 28th, said it would be shipped to store by Dec. 7th. Tracking now shows order is delayed for pickup. Called the store and all they can say it they haven’t gotten it. The computer doesn’t show any tracking information for it at all. Customer service was less than helpful, all they could say is “see that it was supposed to be here, not sure where it is or when it will be in.” But was told if it didn’t arrive by the 23rd that my order will be canceled....... that’s awesome still doesn’t help me needing the computer I ordered"
2213,Been going here for years. They made my dentures and I really love them. You won't regret going here!
2214,Great food!
2215,Beautiful lights♡
2216,One of my favorite places to go for a sit down lunch. Service is friendly.
2217,Very professional staff and very caring about your comfort level. Highly recommended!
2218,Very friendly . Your neighborhood local store for your pet knees and garden.
2219,"This shop has everything you're looking for in the way of Alaska edible products: from smoked salmon, halibut, jellies from Alaska berries, honeys from bees feeding on Alaska flowers, sausage with reindeer meat, cheeses, sourdough pancake mix, Alaska roasted coffees, to their fine handmade chocolates and candies.

They also carry a wide variety of Alaskan jewelry, Alaska t-shirts, and other souvenirs.

Alaska Wild Berry has a long and reputable history from their one shop focusing on the wild berry jams, jellies and honeys, now to stores throughout the state and their expanded lines of products.

The Anchorage location boasts the world's largest chocolate waterfall which is a fun sight. This is a wonderful shop to visit to purchase gifts to give or for oneself."
2220,Beautifully maintained!
2221,"Best selling vape juice for the best price. Also best place to get butane, two big cans of good quality butane for only $12."
2222,"Downtown restaurant clean well lightened. Food was good and service was friendly.  Prices were a bit expensive,  but over all a good time was had.."
2223,Everything was fine.   Nothing stands out as great this visit.
2224,Very quick to serve and food was excellent
2225,"Pizza and maple bacon salad  with the brussell sprouts was super good,wish they had more dessert and non alcoholic drink options."
2226,Nice place to shop
2227,Good breakfast. Try the chicken fried chicken.
2228,"Food is always good here, high traffic on weekends."
2229,"Friendly staff, prices very affordable, military friendly, and good sized units. Everything you need here"
2230,THE BEST FAST FOOD FAST
2231,Excellent coffee.
2232,Love the food
2233,Who doesn't love these trails???
2234,White spruce trailer sales has the best customer service. They helped with every need and went out of their way to insure I was happy. I plan to continue shopping at white spruce every time  I require a trailer.
2235,Posh
2236,"Enjoyed the food, service and of Course the company."
2237,Excellent driver-guides on the ONLY road in Denali Park. Luckily the clouds dissipated for a short time so we were able to see the top of Denali mountain.
2238,Fast and good service. Hearty portions made with care. Great lunch spot and solid salad bar.
2239,Beautiful!
2240,Cadillac margaritas are great! The food is tasty.
2241,Good food and good staff
2242,"Good coffee and light breakfast spot, open early."
2243,Best place for everything you need in the kitchen in town! Really fun store to just browse!
2244,Avoid during tourist season. :)
2245,Looks like an institution for crazies on the outside. Terrible 'makeover'.. But still same ol good ol Kenai McD's when ya need it!
2246,Great place and great people
2247,"Great food friendly, fast service"
2248,Food very good some days just good others
2249,"I really enjoy their coffee. I love that they have toys for older children to play with, and even a place you can fill your own water up. Unfortunately, there is not a changing table in either the men’s or women’s stalls. My baby had an emergency blowout and I had to change her on a sketchy small table in the bathroom. I was extremely disappointed and the barista did not respond well. No apology or even offer to let the owner know. - Having worked in customer service for the past 5 years I was unimpressed."
2250,"I love this place. I go here to much. I love the Tom Yum, Larb salad and sticky rice!"
2251,"Good prices, but lots of clothes were cluttered around everywhere when I went. Granted, it was around Christmas time, and it was busy, so that could have been part of it."
2252,We came for toddler time since I have little ones. My 3 year old had a great time and was able to do most everything. I will advise parents if you allow your little one to jump into the foam pit off the high dive & you also have a baby...come with help as you will be fishing your oldest child out because they are not physically strong enough to crawl out! I as a grown person had a hard time!
2253,Friendly people.
2254,Quiet
2255,Hassle free keg return
2256,The best shopping area
2257,I really like Michaels  but my major issue is not being able to open my app in the store. Their WI Fi is really bad.
2258,My mom loves it once a week or so when out shopping. Wasilla McDonalds is brand new and clean!
2259,Awesome food
2260,"Beautiful place with excellent cappuccinos. Staff is only half friendly, but it's still worth it"
2261,I fly Ravn as a commuter for work during the construction season. I always look forward to the personal touch from the staff. Planes always seem well maintained and clean.
2262,"Great prices,  great quality!"
2263,Far and away the best food we ate on property. Clean good service. The Denali 100th birthday cake was divine.
2264,"Clean, good equipment, sometimes too loud."
2265,Good food and great service.
2266,"Variety and good food, friendly staff,  fair prices."
2267,"Great service and drinks, darling decor, wish it were a little more cozy though. Plus - they use compostable to go cups ❤"
2268,"Beautiful site, informative ranger, and well maintained.  I enjoyed our brief stop here at the visitors center after walking out to Nugget Falls and getting a closer view of the glacier. I recommend stopping at the visitors center before the hike, however it was nice to stop in and warm up afterward."
2269,This gas station is great
2270,"What a downer , Saturday night. Door greeter super uptight about checking Id's , not welcoming at all. Our group felt like we were more of an annoyance . After long delay our waiter came to take our order, member from our group was tired of waiting so went directly to the bar to order drinks.  Politely I asked our waiter if he could wait a a few seconds so we  could stop our member from ordering drinks at the bar . Humpys waiter was instantly irritated  and walked away to another table. Been regulars at Humpys for years . Attitudes here have changed for the worse.   Gonna have to mark this place off our list. We stopped at other Irish pubs in town, just the opposite experience , warm welcoming staff , lots of smiles and complimentary food for St. Patrick's day. At least Anchorage has choices."
2271,"What can I say, more often than not the drive thru is littered with employees that have never worked in their life. More training is needed for these high turn over staff members. But even if this store had 0.1 stars on google, I doubt their business would be affected. It's a standard McDonald's, except this specific one seems to mix up orders and give you unpaid for food more often than not so 2/5 from me."
2272,One of my favorite places to shop.  Customer service exceeds the good selection & great prices
2273,Really great food and serivse.
2274,Great store for all your outdoor needs. Helpful and knowledgeable staff
2275,The sunmer solctice Art On Fire event is really fun!
2276,Great service
2277,"So many batteries! They even had a battery for my Rhino side-by-side that the auto parts store did not have. Better yet, it was half the quoted price of the auto parts store!!! Very happy with the knowledgeable service, excellent selection, and great prices. I will definitely return!"
2278,good food. 15$ burger.
2279,Food is okay. Greasy put flavorful.
2280,Clean and nice
2281,"Love this sports facility! Not as big as the Sullivan Arena, but it gets the spectators closer to the players. I've mostly attended Seawolves basketball and volleyball here. Fans get to know each other well enough to become friends, if they aren't already! Every seat is a good seat, even in the ""nosebleed"" area; not that far away. I haven't attended a concert here, but friends tell me sound is great. The running/walking track is very nice. I'm not a fan of the fast food concession, but there are fresh food and prepped food stands provided by the Varsity Grill that are tasty. Plus, the Varsity Grill itself is a good place to eat or catch a beer or glass of wine."
2282,I can't believe I waited so long to try this place.
2283,"I would like to say kudos to the girl who highlighted my hair (sorry I forget your name) but she had long dark hair. First let me say they took me as a walk in and I was a little skeptical because I'm kinda weird about my hair. Also I have panic attacks and sometimes leave establishments . I did not leave they are a down to earth business and the hairdresser listened to what I had to say and all I can say is MAGNIFICENT and thank you muchly appreciated
My name is Susan Henry and I recommend this place whole heart edly"
2284,"(Translated by Google) WWWWWooooooooowwwwwwww !!!!!!!!!!

WWWWWooooooooowwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!"
2285,"Fast prompt service, and the bill was a reasonable price"
2286,Typical Arby's
2287,Hire or make sure employees are actually doin their job. This is a circus.
2288,Great fun and nice employees
2289,Beautiful & Wonderful
2290,Best pad Thai! And awesome food
2291,"A glimpse of how native Alaskan live their life and their culture. Not really my cup a tea, but could be the highlighted for visitor who into art and history."
2292,This place is really great for breakfast. Many delicious options. Staff is very friendly. Food is cooked perfectly every time I go here.
2293,Love the concerts White Swan brings there!! Thanks for making music and coffee as an art💞
2294,Great food at reasonable prices
2295,Great views!
2296,We were a part of a large group that preordered food to be ready at a certain time. Wonderful idea because ordering food then waiting for several hours with kids can be horrible. But the tuna tacos were over cooked. I thought maybe it was due to the fact that we had a large group. When we asked the waitress she explained that when we ordered we had to tell the cook how we wanted the ahu tuna cooked and if we did not it would come fully cooked. WHAT! ahu tuna should never be cooked fully. The waitress said that it was just like the burgers pink or no pink. AHU TUNA SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY SEARED ON ALL SIDES AND LEFT ALONE. Restaurant chefs should know this however bar cooks do not. So if this is a bar then I can simply say I mistake however I consider this place a restaurant so the three stars because they offered preordering.
2297,Very nice cars and trucks at a very good price
2298,Expensive. Not what I wanted for a haircut.
2299,Best Mecican food in Fairbanks and good prices.
2300,"The waitress was nice and fairly attentive. The music was rather loud for an early afternoon. Both burger patties were charred well overdone. The cheese steak was good but had too many jalepenos. The curly fries, onion rings and and beer were good."
2301,Ask for no red sauce and you get no meat
2302,I spent nearly all summer in the area on the Swan Lake Fire. The whole region is beautiful
2303,Super convenient location. It just opened up so all the equipment is new which is nice.
2304,nice place to stay. warm and spacious room. loved it.
2305,"Heritage has been a welcome replacement for the Starbucks that previously occupied this space, but keeps the same streetside vibe that the location gave its prior tenants. The service is speedy and the coffee is far better than other brands. I've had the inconvenience of having Heritage be out of cold brew after I paid, and the staff was happy to offer me a refund or replacement with another more expensive drink. Great place all around!"
2306,Best one in town n price.
2307,"Not as good as I'd hoped. It didn't taste super fresh to me. Perhaps I'm spoiled coming from Seattle, but I expected better. Good atmosphere but I'll look elsewhere for sushi in my next visit to Anchorage."
2308,Food was good but service could use some help when dinning in. Checked on us before we got our food but once we got it didn’t see her again tell the check. They don’t have a gluten free crust that they offer in other locations.
2309,"We really liked this place. The rooms were nothing special, almost more of a motel style, but they were clean and in great proximity to the mountains. Great views and little shops all around with local goods and handmade items. They have there own walking trails and plenty of nature tours will pick you up from this location."
2310,Good food. Fast service
2311,"Best place to eat in Healy! Outstanding staff & menu.
Period! ❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍"
2312,Hair
2313,My husband loves them.
2314,Delicious pizza and fast delivery. Portions always huge and well worth the price.
2315,Best sushi in the valley. Great service.
2316,"Service department assist very well. Without warranty, auto repairs are expensive here as is the case in any dealership."
2317,"Went here for a morning meeting. Great laid back staff. Barbie is a load of fun. Will return, for sure."
2318,"They've got it all , just about. I luv it !"
2319,Don't let the limited menu deter you. Excellent pierogies and excellent record collection! Do not miss this place!
2320,Such an amazing place and so much to do!!
2321,Quick and easy car wash.
2322,Good for sightseeing.
2323,It's a slow boring dive. Except for REI and Guitar Center.
2324,1st Class outlet 1st Class vehicles
2325,"The big bad Chugach has all you could want in a national Forest. Great trails, well kept facilities where applicable, tons of space to roam, and berries galore!"
2326,It's just like any old Walmart!!! Nothing has changed.
2327,Ryan and the crew do a great job fixing up my vehicles. Honest and fast!!
2328,Great food and great customer service.
2329,"Fun, amazing sledding! Beautiful!"
2330,Good walk
2331,Amazing place and amazing service. I love it here and come here every weekend for breakfast. Super friendly staff and delicious food. If i could give it more stars I totally would.
2332,"Nice and new, but parking lot gets a bit difficult to navigate with the entrance/exits easily getting clogged"
2333,Had a great time with friends and family. It was plenty large enough to accommodate this group.
2334,Decent sub shop for the price. Can't knock a Good value.
2335,"This is a really great place to spend an hour or two with just about anyone. The whole garden is well cared for, there are a wide variety of flowers, trees, and other interesting plants to appreciate. Benches and tables are in a variety of places, making it a good spot for a picnic lunch. Also there is a water feature with a couple of tables by it that is perfect to bring kids to play in, on nice days there are usually some parents already here. The only bad things are that sometimes people damage some of the plants, and that the only bathrooms are the portable plastic kind."
2336,Has a lot to do
2337,It was not good as the cilantro was not available and also they didn't put Basil topping.
2338,There's literally endless possibilities of Making whatever you want there if you volunteer there. And the staff there are friendly. The prices there are reasonable. And the cafe is great
2339,Great service and drinks!
2340,Everything is so unique
2341,Great sandwiches and atmosphere!!!
2342,Good meat great produce
2343,"Beautiful church, inspiring mass daily! This is what our community needs...

Over the last year we attended confirmation and faith formation classes at Sacred Heart. The RCIA journey for my son and I, who both have special needs and disabilities was life affirming. We were treated with such compassion, understanding and love. Father Joseph shares the word of the Lord in a way everyone can understand and relate too. This past Easter my son was Bapitized and we were welcomed as official members of the Catholic Church.

Everyone is so caring and welcoming. Very family friendly and community minded. There is so much love and acceptance in this church.

Thank you for changing our lives!"
2344,"Mediocre ""Mexican food"" good for a quick bite at 2 in the morning if you really need it."
2345,Drive through is way too slow
2346,The website was easy to handle
2347,"Fantastic food, great environment and great service"
2348,"I ordered delivery! The malasadas were delicious. It was a great jelly/dough ratio and they were cooked beautifully. Very well done. I feel like I got a great deal for the size and quality of the pastries! I had a concern about my delivery and called the owner, Mary, and she was friendly and quick to help me!

Heads up: delivery times are an approximation, just like it says on the online order form. Don't expect them to arrive on the dot! The delivery driver is also very friendly and texted me ~10 minutes before he arrived!

10/10 would order again!"
2349,"Very pleasant atmosphere, nice staff, great portions and delicious food!  We very much enjoyed our time in Brewster's!"
2350,"Cheap, not crowded, but not real clean"
2351,"(Translated by Google) Fast friendly and rich

(Original)
Rápidos amables y rico"
2352,Store is clean but prices can be high on some items.
2353,"Food is very simple with limited options, but they are all made with care and are quite tasty. Coffee is a bit basic, but serviceable. Warm, friendly and welcoming decor make this place a treat to visit."
2354,Awesome
2355,Always a great place to shop for tools and things
2356,Excellent ride up the mountain
2357,Love the oldies music! Staff is friendly! Generous portions! And my family is now Kava-Holics!
2358,The service was beyond horrible. I was on a business trip and needed a receipt for my expenses so I went inside and asked for one. He yelled at me for not being able to get one from the machine outside. He also yelled again when I asked to use the restroom even though I was a paying customer. I was already tired and stressed as I was traveling alone and this did not help at all. Please take your business somewhere else. There is a Chevron just down the street that I wish I had seen before I stopped here.
2359,"An decent place to stay if homeless, good meals mostly, & church services."
2360,"It's a hit and miss. Sometimes the food and service are great. Sometimes it's so-so.  Lately it's gone downhill, such as lack of cleanliness and they're serving cold, old food."
2361,Nice rooms with little kitchenettes. Good staff and a nice resteraunt. Good place for the price. Only complaint is that we found trash in on of the beds.
2362,Wash your car here
2363,Great show 👍. Shawn was funny and very informative - and it was fun to play with the puppies!
2364,Nice staff. Really I must say they are very nice. But....the martini wasn't great and the lackluster food mean we won't be back.  For the HIGH price I would expect better. Very sad.
2365,"Randy's glass was quick to get my front windshield replaced and they even gave me a ride home which helped me out a lot.

Will definitely be using them in the future for sure."
2366,I love the rush nitro keto options.
2367,Alaska at its best
2368,"Excellent authentic Mexican food, some of the best in Alaska"
2369,Live band and pool! Yes please! Bartender was very nice. Id love to go there again. :)
2370,Loved this pub. It was right across from McKinley Chalet hotel. Good lot of options of beer and pizza. Good decor and great service.
2371,Friendly staff but the places a little bit dirty
2372,It's a nice camp ground. Camping spots are space out well. It has the convenience of being in town but still feel like you're out camping.
2373,"Lots of big machines. Fair prices. Clean, but not fancy."
2374,On Anchorage tour!
2375,Very interesting bear exhibit.
2376,Has it all
2377,"Good movie, good service and clean restrooms. 👍"
2378,The greek pizza was good.
2379,"Right parts, good people!"
2380,Great family fun
2381,Eventful
2382,good but could be faster
2383,"Taylor was awesome, very friendly, helped us with everything, even measured a piece of furniture for us. 200% Satisfied! We'll be back for sure! The ladies at the warehouse were awesome too, the guys helping us load up. Thank you!"
2384,I'd go again!
2385,Went to see jumanji and they sold us tickets. We bought concessions sat in our seats. 15 minutes later a couple said we were in their seats. We gave way & went to a manager.  The manager refunded everything because the guy selling tickets sold us tickets  for 2 days later. They wasted an hour & 1/2  & never  comped us. Will be a long time before I go back
2386,Love this place
2387,Awesome for family events!
2388,Great little coffee hut with two drive ups.  Tasty drinks using Kaladi Bros Coffee with a wide assortment of goodies and food as well.  Really awesome biscotti!  Perfect for those that are getting up early to go to the Alaska Club or just leaving and want a quick snack but don't want to go somewhere in your workout clothes.
2389,"Place where to see all people's of different cultures in the only best place on earth,  Alaska!!!!"
2390,"5 pieces of lamb neck, and cost $12.97 😆"
2391,"The good: Our 14 yr old cat survived and passed the intestinal blockage with non-invasive treatment, and is doing very well. I am very glad we said ""No."" to the $10k (estimated) surgery option. The staff was friendly and talkative, but the doctor was a bit pushy concerning surgery.
The bad: This clinic is VERY, VERY, VERY expensive relative to other clinics in Southcentral, including VCA. Our bill came in at just over $2,500. Going back to College Village Animal Clinic. Yeah, its an hour drive each way, but we just can't afford bills like this on a 5-figure income."
2392,"Great location. Rooms are nice with coffee machine, fridge & very comfortable beds. Beautiful view from my room in winter. Really nice employees too. Nice gym."
2393,Parks guy was great

2395,"I've been here a couple times, had pizza last night it was good.
Stopped by again tried the halibut burger with homemade fries. I'm a snob when it comes to seafood. Flavor, texture and handling are all very important to me. The few times I have have seafood here, it's good. Above average. My friends had the cheese burgers and liked them too. On a scale of 1-10 we give it a nine. For those from South of the Canadian border you'll get a bit if sticker shock on the price but, in my opinion it's on par for a good meal in a seasonal Alaska town."
2396,"The food, what I got of it, was good. The service not so much. First, it took significantly longer than quoted for the food to be ready, and I was up against the clock. That is why I called it in ahead of time. Then they forgot pretty important parts of my meal, so I get to the office lunch and we are missing things. Not cool."
2397,"Excellent food, well worth the wait!"
2398,"Made from scratch everything, attention to details, excellent customer service. Expect to be tempted by huge trays of fresh baked sweet rolls constantly coming out of the oven. Give in to the temptation. Try the soup. Any flavor, or all of them. Sourdough pancakes might not appeal to everyone, but try them anyway. They are uniquely delicious.

Be advised, at first prices may seem a bit steep, but if you're on a budget, portions are large enough to split."
2399,"Good, local restaurant with good drink selection!"
2400,"Tasty meals from all the world based on Mexican cuisine. My husband liked Filet mignon, saying good quality meat. I had fusion Mexican style salmon. It had chorizo and fried tortilla and vegetables and beans in layers with cheese and avocado sour cream."
2401,"This place is great, they could use all the help and donations they can get. I'd love to open up a place like this in California and another in Texas. Very inspiring"
2402,Needed Koehler flush valve gaskets. They are over 3.5” and generic toil valves won’t fit. {Don’t Buy Koehler!!!} The former USMC man helped me significantly. He had good follow through even though they didn’t have what I needed. He took my name and called me back after he did quite a bit of homework. Found the needed kit in Anchorage! Would have preferred to buy in the Valley.
2403,I discovered Boom during Finals week as a Freshman in college and I've been coming ever since! We love their creativity and hospitality here and it's been so cool to see the upgrades to the shop in the last couple of months. Everything I've ordered here has been DELICIOUS! This is absolutely our go-to now.
2404,"The glacier itself is visible from the road.  If you want to get close to it though, it's on private land.  It was during the winter season when you have to be on a guided tour.  We were sort of in a time crunch situation and the girl working the front desk was amazing.  She arranged for us to have a snowmobile tour so we didn't have to wait for the walking tour (it wasn't leaving for another 45 minutes and would take 2-3 times longer).  Our guide was great and took us to a couple of places that they couldn't get to on the walking tour.  Long Rifle Lodge is nearby and good for lunch!"
2405,Connors Lake has great trails and tons of friendly pups and families.
2406,Nice happy hour! $5 appetizers.  Erupting spud was delicious and not too unhealthy for a dieter :)
2407,Good food
2408,Garlic Chicken Dinner was Great as well as the House Fried Rice with Egg mixed in
2409,"Cheyenne was great! She took the time to make sure I was happy with my haircut, despite the fact that it was closing time. Even took the time to style my hair like I wanted.

I donated my hair and they had the paperwork for a reputable place to donate it for me to mail it off.

Great place!"
2410,Hostess was talking on phone and didn't get order right. Calazone was over onioned and light on chicken and BBQ
2411,"I went here to pick up an order for Uber Eats.  Didn't eat here, but friendly staff."
2412,Great place for eating  out my wife got hit on by a old guys
2413,"While they have the usual products sold, I feel like this store is kind of a mess. The baby section clothes are usually a wreck. I also feel like they push too hard on signing up for their credit card."
2414,Probably one of my favorite places in the valley.   House fried rice!
2415,"Denali National Park is one of the most incredibly beautiful places on earth, and this National Parks Visitor's Center is the perfect place to start your visit.  The facility is fairly new and filled with fascinating exhibits for all ages.  They also have a fun Junior Ranger program for kids."
2416,"Great food, great drinks, loud and kinda in your face waiters but oh well, always pretty busy lots of stuff on the walls lots of TVs small tables"
2417,Nice people working 👍
2418,Beautiful place
2419,Awesome service and they do care about your pets they treat them like family. I took my dog last Wednesday and a man with a pitbull a Rottweiler and a saint Bernard were trying to hurt my dog the two ladys that worked there were saving my pups life spinning in circles as to protect her. Thank You Lady's and all staff. If not for them my pet would have been hurt seriously. The man is in a small box car truck had no leashes on anybody his big digs nor the little dog. He laughed. That's not funny
2420,"Nice place, friendly service, meat kinda dry :("
2421,Nice place to hang out.
2422,"They did an awesome job on my fiancee's tattoo, would recommend them to anyone looking for a place to get one."
2423,"The service was terrific, the food was great, but there was a strong cleaning chemical smell throughout the restaurant, which made for an unpleasant dining experience..."
2424,Awesome place for family to come have fun or go for a walk. The airplane museum was my favorite. I'm from California here in Fairbanks having a great vacation. Fairbanks ppl are nice and respectful...
2425,I think the picture of our appetizer says it all. We paid $16 or more for that! Our server was great though. She laughed at my really stupid joke as much as I did. Honestly the service is the only reason I give this place 2 stars instead of 1.
2426,"Loved the atmosphere,  drinks,  and food.   Service was professional and friendly."
2427,probably the best sushi in Anchorage
2428,I love their jalapeno burgers
2429,Great ice cream to calm yourself down
2430,This one is better than the one at 5th Ave mall
2431,"This place is the best. The service is great, they treat you like loved and respected family.  The food is good like mommas, the best. Beer ain't bad either . Hmmm doggies, just gotta go to see for yourself ."
2432,Nice little 9 hole course.
2433,"Very surprised... I went into this place on a very slow sunday night. Almost as a last resort because I was quite looking for such a large spot. My group had an enjoyable experience here. They were very friendly, made us some very delicious drinks, invited us to play pool upstairs. We will definitely be returning. 🙂"
2434,"Amazed. Got an excellent deal on exactly the vehicle requested, minimal pressure, payment I requested and an outstanding warranty. Would recommend to a human that I like."
2435,Waited 52 minutes in the Lobby after ordering
2436,"One of the best places to eat breakfast lunch or dinner,"
2437,Very interesting and knowledgeable Rangers.
2438,Excellent coffee.
2439,Pizza is great. Love the all meat pizza great with a side of their garlic butter and a mountain dew.
2440,Very good food
2441,"Fast food serving, great food, and really cheap price compare to other Japanese restaurants in Anchorage. 24/7 Happy hour makes lunch menu price unbelievable for the amount and quality of food you get."
2442,Great walking pathway behind and around the arena.  Shaded and paved the entire mile.
2443,Never enough check out lanes open
2444,"Burgers are good but the real reason to come here is the smashfries.  If you get nothing else, get the fries.  Covered in olive oil, rosemary and garlic.  Only gave 4 stars because while the line to place the order went quick, the line to get the food took absolutely forever and there were too many employees in the lobby area just standing around.  They should be moved to the kitchen to help food come out quicker."
2445,"great as usual, good service. always a good dining experience for me."
2446,"Dr. Rennard was very professional and informative. David, who helped me with my glasses, was extremely kind and personable. I will definitely recommend this office to my friends."
2447,"Good food & service, fun decor"
2448,Staff is friendly and helpful. I came here for painting supplies and they have a great selection at what seemed to be reasonable prices.
2449,I am always satisfied when I eat here! The food is always on piont!
2450,Typical wendy's. Kinda slow though
2451,Great skate shop and really friendly employees
2452,Always love coming here so amazing here.
2453,I love a late night dinner at Leroys. Never had a bad time.
2454,"Great food, nice atmosphere!"
2455,"One of the great and locally owned novelty and tobacco paraphernalia head shops in anchorage 🙌✌📌. This place has it all . I don't personally vape because I'm not sure I'm quite cool enough but if I did the have a wide variety of vape ecigs and juices for them ! They also carry a huge selection of cigarette rolling papers , whether you like smoking regular filtered cigarettes or Giant 2 oz cones when you smoke a cigarette they have everything in between also. If you're looking for a really nice glass tobacco pipe they have hand pipes all the way up to really fancy cylindrical water percolation device types . This awesome stor even carries novelty sex toy items. At one of the events I even got to meet Ron Jeremy one of my heroes, I learned so many strokes from him and got to shake his hand at Planet X what a great place. Pornstars ,glass pipes, whippets cool employees, you name it😎👍"
2456,Best burgers and fries anywhere!
2457,Dropped off my Alaska Guide Marlin for an inspection and cleaning. They cleaned it up real nice and I got it back quickly. Thanks so much!
2458,"I liked it. They certainly packed a lot of stuff into a small space. Waterpark includes wave pool, lazy river, 3 slides, hot tub, and a small pirate ship play area for small children. There is food available. I didn't have it so I can't give a rating for that. The reason that this is a 4 star place is that 2 of the slides were shut down for a while, an hour+. Other than that, good experience. Hope this helps"
2459,"Nice atmosphere, and the food is great.
Oh and what a great view."
2460,Quick and easy to do business here. They are very knowledgeable about all your household appliances.
2461,"Prices are way too high! 39.99 for a sweater with a hole in it. Most of the prices I saw, you can buy new at a retailer for the same price or lower!"
2462,I LOVE THE STEAK WITH ONE FOOT  ITALIAN BREAD AND AMERICAN CHEESE WITH EVERYTHING ALSO VINAIGRETTE SAUCE!!!
2463,"Friendly service, accommodating"
2464,Ominous vibes
2465,"Boomsauce! Great place to let the kiddos burn of that energy and to socialize with others their age. Always very clean. I love how the staff always decorate for the various seasons and holidays. I think that besides being a place for kids with all the various activities that the close second is how they organization all of the events and venues to make them more exciting and fun. I also like how their Facebook page is always up to date. I would like it if they had longer weekend hours, hint hint :) finally, the most important aspect is that they have the absolutely best and friendliest staff ever."
2466,"Returned trailer here. After a bit of phone help, we got the trailer returned. After hours, so no one in office. Owners did return since they run campground nearby. Return went very smoothly!"
2467,"Great food, even better view of the Matanuska Glacier"
2468,"You won't find better food, friendly service and cleanliness, anywhere in your travels."
2469,"The ignition interlock installation went smoothly and in a timely fashion. Bring cash because that's the only payment he'll accept, since he's been burned before by people with plastic. Once the installation is complete, any other services require you to call Intoxalock and make an appointment before he'll even talk to you about it."
2470,"Good food, pleasant atmosphere, and the kids prices are reasonable for Alaska."
2471,Favorite place in the valley to eat!
2472,Baileys furniture is alright. Not the best or most affordable place but its alright. Some workers will welcome you but none will help you find a good mattress or furniture until you go and find a worker and ask them about things they mostly are talking to each other and not to customers until a customer comes up to them.
2473,A busy place but good service
2474,"Not working, did not see a single Sea Lion"
2475,"They have some nice all age concerts, there great when they are outside during the summer time. Good food, and nice dinner & movie nights."
2476,"(Translated by Google) The largest national park in the world. It is not easy to access. More than 4 hours drive from Anchorage
There is a museum and a theater next to the information desk.
You can take a walk through the forest.

2477,Breakfast needs improvement!
2478,Still light at 1130pm
2479,"Decent food and drinks, price is higher than most places in town for the quality but a nice atmosphere and events"
2480,"It's Wal-mart, just like every other Wal-mart. Pretty sure you know what to expect."
2481,good stuff
2482,Another discoverer of an occupied area
2483,"Stunning beauty, takes your breath away."
2484,Beautiful place
2485,Thanks!!
2486,Very good groceries
2487,The food was three stars for taste and five stars for volume. The experience was worth the trip.
2488,Pretty good for subs
2489,Kendall Ford
2490,"The food here is always great...all of it.
Small cozy restaurant with a story behind it.
For dessert I tried the 10yr tawny and the 10yr Madeira. The Madeira was sweet and a pleasure to enjoy after dinner. The tawny had a coffee or hint of chocolate, I recommend the 10yr madeira."
2491,Love going there every time i am in Anchorage.  Great variety and people
2492,Not crowded at all. But wonderwoman sux
2493,Not that good
2494,"(Translated by Google) To go back.

Da ritornarci."
2495,We thought it was okay. The place was busy and so was our waitress
2496,Best chocolate in Alaska!!!!
2497,"The burgers are good, but $19 for one person is awfully spendy. Cheeseburger, large fry & regular drink."
2498,Very outdated but decent price.
2499,Fast service
2500,"They were fairly busy so it took  a while to get help, but once they got to me I was helped quickly. They ordered my parts which came in faster than expected. Downsides, transactions can take a while so there may be a bit of a wait and their loaner tool box appears to be fairly depleted. Upsides, good people, knowledgeable staff, helpful and efficient when they get to you."
2501,Very friendly and professional. Calvin always seems to be happy and welcoming to customers.
2502,"Always fast, friendly and great food!"
2503,"Continental Nissan. I've had an incredible experience with sales & manager's Ms. Pak, Mr. Jackson & Mr. Rayner. I presented a dilemma of trade & purchase within three days of shipping a new Rogue overseas. The staff prioritized my time & situation by presenting good pricing up front, by processing loan promptly, remaining involved to add roof rails, answered my questions and my calls. In the beginning, it was not all sunshine, but that is past & this new experience is what will bring me back."
2504,Love the variety!
2505,"Awesome store, hooked us up with a used tank for very cheap and included a filter and light. Super cool supplies and gadgets for your aquariums, as well as amazing selection of fresh and salt water fish. They offer fish beyond the tiny sized ones at the other pet stores. They have full grown salt water fish, and even SHARKS! Prices are on par with what you would expect for the type of fish you're getting. They also have anemones and beautiful coral selections. If you're serious about your fresh, brackish, or salt water habitats, this is the place to go. Staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly, and locally owned. You will walk away feeling like you were their most important customer, whether you're spending $50 or $1000. Give them a visit and say hello to the fishies! :)"
2506,"Great place for family visit and nice evening getaways. Amazing store front with many things to look at and do. Great staff, ice cream, and coffee as well."
2507,"Only one in town. But clean nice people. Easy parking. You can also have a beer if you arrive during beer hours. The arcade is for the younger crowd, no old fun stuff. The bathroom has been clean, and the theaters over the years have been mostly kept up and clean."
2508,Best gluten free pizza
2509,"Very short trail but also very easy. Moving beyond the pathway is accessible but dangerous. We passed a lot of dogs and babies along the way but not an overly crowded area. Overall, easily accessible and a good view. You can spend a lot of time here taking in the sights."
2510,Hands down the best pizza in Alaska.
2511,Christy is the best!
2512,"I really like their prices on everything. If I don't watch myself I get carried away, putting everything I see in the cart. Its friendly, clean  professional customer service and care."
2513,"It's what you expect; not the biggest, not the smallest. Good prices, some things you can find cheaper at Wally's or Fred's but for the most part it's worth it."
2514,Not what it once was.
2515,Great historical ride through the mountains
2516,"Good food,fun place"
2517,The Bargain Bin always has something you didn't know you needed!
2518,"They have a little bit of everything, good service and prices."
2519,This show was a lot of fun!
2520,Two for Thursday
2521,Always a pleasant stop
2522,"Good beer. But don't try to call, they never pick up"
2523,"Great atmosphere, especially for Vikings fans!! They had great deals and the wings were gigantic. Great place to watch games and hang out"
2524,Another fast food restaurant
2525,It's okay.
2526,"Great service and food, open 24/7"
2527,"Great time for the kids, young and teens.
Plenty of parking. Easy to find location.
Open gym on Fridays allows you to call in and come use the day expending all your ""little peoples' excess energy.
The staff are very nice and friendly."
2528,I've been to a lot of other car washes in town and this is the only one that has actually gotten my vehicle clean.  Other automated washes always left a lot of road grime and the self washes didn't do a good enough job with the sprayer and the brushes left horrible scratches in my paint.  I've come to Monster Wash countless numbers of times and not one complaint.  It can get really busy in the afternoon/evenings but thankfully they're open 24 hours.  If you get gas at the Holiday station next door you can buy the car wash there and get a one dollar discount.
2529,Best Fish and Chips EVER!!!
2530,"Corporate sports bar feel,  the over priced burger I had was incredibly overcooked and should have never been served. My drink was empty for most of my time there. It wasn't very busy as most of the tables were empty and the entirety of the staff stood behind the bar talking to each other. Skip it"
2531,Not a bad stay. Shuttle drivers were both very professional and the front desk help was very nice
2532,your basic expensive chain breakfast.
2533,"Would of given 5.... but the embelished, repetitive, tired stories from obese gas bag pilots can't go unnoticed. The oysters are great. Bring headphones or chat up one of the gold diggers lingering around on the celly."
2534,Great glacier trip! The stuff are really nice. Allow some time to find another parking lot as the parking lot here is always full before the cruise leaves.
2535,trap house isle
2536,Friendly and professional staff. You appointment happens when it is scheduled. Your stylist is very skilled and will put in the extra time to make your look perfect. Very highly recommended to both men and women.
2537,"You won't be disappointed. The view from the highway at spectacular and mount Drum, Stanford & Mount Wrangell are as beautiful as any mountains in Alaska. Spectacular"
2538,Watch out for speed traps
2539,I like their clothes.
2540,My wife and I were stranded in Tok awaiting RV repairs and in the 24 hours we've been here we've already eaten at Fast Eddy's twice. Good food at reasonable prices. Dinner service on Saturday was busy but still fairly quick. Sunday brunch was great!
2541,Didn't really shop around much but the people there were very helpful even after they learned they didn't have what i was looking for.
2542,Needs to really be up keeping with their policies to have 18 and up and must Supervisior their kids. Also can’t even carry your drinks around like other D&B’s in the lower 48.
2543,Good prices and delivered to Homer for free. Mike humored my questions and was helpful with my modest order. Much better than home depot and less expressive than sB.S.
2544,Coors light.
2545,"Tammy does an amazing job loosening up muscles. I've used quite a few massage therapists over the years, and she is definitely one of the best I've used, and she truly is affordable. She charges far less than others I've used in town who are not nearly as effective at loosening tight muscles."
2546,Just a fun place and the view omg
2547,"Awesome food, great people."
2548,"(Translated by Google) Very good place to live

(Original)
Muy buen lugar para vivir"
2549,Always a lovely stop
2550,"I love to eat here, I go sometimes to cover up anxiety with food"
2551,Great little quilt shop.
2552,"Go next door to potlatch park to see a working carver, and restored village."
2553,"My experience at the theater was fine, but my wife and I made 4 trips to this movie theatre to buy tickets for a single movie, and they weren't open even when their schedule said they were open. On top​ of that we couldn't buy tickets online no matter how hard we tried, and calling the number given led only to a long list of options, none of which forward you to a real person. I admit that this theater has just changed management, but they should at least have a phone number set up for you to call."
2554,Great service and good food.
2555,Nice big theaters
2556,Great place!
2557,"Great waitstaff, food was ok- nothing too special."
2558,It was quick and easy to rent a uhaul. The staff were friendly. Building was organized. Uhaul was clean. To extend our rental was simple and hassle free. I would recommend them.
2559,Customer service is lacking only because of lack of personnel.  Never really had a problem with the store.  They are just over worked.
2560,Best coffee place in town. Great atmosphere and experienced baristas.
2561,"My wife and I enjoy coming here for a fun night out. The arcade is good clean fun, and the food is good."
2562,"The food was good, the music was bad, the beer was cold, the place is kind of a dump. Over all not bad."
2563,Great selection and competitive prices with Wal-Mart.
2564,"Very very nice selection, gives military discount to boot. Friendly."
2565,"This where I get my detox drinks, decent prices. Thanks ladies..."
2566,"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Great beer selection, incredible pizzas, and the cheese fries are to dine for. My group came here every other night for dinner that we were in Denali for. Service staff is friendly, quick, and the atmosphere here is excellent."
2567,The atmosphere and food is great.
2568,"One of my top spots so far! Next to having awesome food, they can also deliver on JBER. If you're on quarantine and need a solid meal, they are your best bet!"
2569,"While under construction at the time, food was still nice, hot, and tasty. :)"
2570,Favorite bookshop in Fairbanks by a long shot
2571,Great service! They really do pick you up! 🤣
2572,"Amazing food, with a seasonal rotating menu (good for the environment 👍). Portions were a little smaller than you'll normally find in an American restaurant but it was the perfect amount of food for me. My friend I was dining with was a little hungry after finishing his meal, but we each got a dessert and he got so full eating his dessert that he took half home. The desserts were spectacular. Cozy setting, small seating area so it never gets too loud. Will be back, at least once every season to try the new menu :)"
2573,Great foods..drinks
2574,I love the meat selection and Free samples
2575,Great prices!! Tasty home style cooking! Love the atmosphere! Love the history!  Family owned an operated! Defintly worth checking out!
2576,Very informative and the kids family pack was great entertainment to borrow.
2577,"Always good, the broccoli cheddar soup available every day makes me happy. I never miss broccoli cheddar with my 6 inch sub."
2578,"Delectable sandwiches on delicious fresh baked bread. If you are wanting a good sub in town, then Firehouse Subs is easily the destination of choice."
2579,"Great burger and fries. No cards taken so bring cash or pay a service charge at the ATM located within the restaurant.

Only one girl working the day I went; covering the tables, bar, and even the grill but she still managed to please, great job holding down the fort!"
2580,Take the ride. It is well worth it and the views are wonderful. Well worth the money to see the glacier
2581,Fast service and delicious coffee that’s perfection in a cup every time!  Baristas are friendly and always smile and say good morning!  I love to swing by and start my day with a hot cuppa and some small-town cheer!
2582,"Really clean place, it's brand new. Nice rooms and comfortable beds. Very close to shopping and a mall, also on a bus route."
2583,Nice selection of stores
2584,It was aight
2585,They are good at helping people with holiday meala.
2586,Great food and the owner is very personable.
2587,"$$$ Prices Listed Below $$$

If you're looking for a verity of meat and BBQ then you need to visit Texas Roadhouse.

Everything here tastes fantastic.  The BBQ Chicken Sandwich is my favorite item because it's cheap and simple.  The prices here are a little more expensive, so eat all the peanuts you can.  The bread rolls with the cinnamon butter are amazing too.

The employees occasionally will dance, so that's unique.  What I didn't realize is there is an outdoor seating area, but I've never been asked if I want to sit outside.  On a sunny day I will request to eat outside next time.

Bottomless non-alcoholic (soda & ice tea) drinks here.  Impossible to leave here dehydrated!

2588,One of the best places to eat in Anchorage and the price is not too bad for the service you give management is incredible at this restaurant especially Jane Benihana needs to hire her to train their manager truly incredible lady and it takes a lot to impress me.
2589,"Great dining experience, and wonderful food!"
2590,"Fresh roasted coffee, and friendly staff.   Coffee can also be ground specifically  to demand."
2591,Great service
2592,Awesome customer service.
2593,"This is, by far, the best Midas in Eagle River / Anchorage. They are incredibly courteous, professional, fast, and get it right the first time.

I brought my Escape to them when an ABS light came on and I had a brake malfunction. They had the car turned around in less than half a day.

I brought my Stratus in for 60K-mile servicing and they handled the items that needed to be handled, they didn't change out items that were fine and had plenty of life.

Now that I live close to the Glenn on Muldoon they are closest (at least easiest) Midas to get to and I look forward to going back."
2594,"Excellent customer service. I had a Naruto ramen. Was very tasty. And good portion size. Clean, quiet, an it has anime and Japanese shows on TV's. -Cool-"
2595,Amazing food. I can't believe we discovered such a gem in Cooper Landing. I had the halibut cheek stew. Amazing.
2596,"Great atmosphere,  even better coffee.  Food was delicious,  and it's not super crowded so you can have a nice quiet conversation."
2597,Everyone loved there food although it took a while to get
2598,So so good!! My family's favorite
2599,The line is always long downtown wild scoops. Favorite place to buy my ice cream tho
2600,Craft supplies
2601,The sushi here is alright. I know a lot of people rave about this place. Personally I think it's over priced for what you get there. There are lots of other sushi places around Anchorage that have better tasting sushi and for cheaper. I have given this place a couple of chances and not just basing my review on a single encounter.
2602,"Great wings, sometimes slow service.  Love the Thai Curry flavored wings."
2603,Great place to go saves from having to go to Costco.
2604,"The staff were very friendly.  The food was unique and very tasty, except for the very dry and old hamburger buns."
2605,Great food
2606,Very com an peaceful
2607,This is place is really special. I enjoyed it a bunch. Great prices too!
2608,"Cool place, trails, water, slides, swings, and grass. Good for 2 year olds"
2609,Fun place
2610,Hidden gem! Fantastic food and brew with an emphasis on both. Best kept brewery secret in Anchorage! If you know where it is!
2611,Awesome collectables and Alaska.
2612,Always have something I need or something I need to take home.  One of the best stores in town.  Returns are a breeze.  Just don't go in with to much time on your hands or you'll come out with way more than you planned.
2613,"Great service, kind people?!!"
2614,Great
2615,The Chinese here is fantastic.
2616,"Had to order a new blower motor for my 2018 Nissan. Not only did O'Reilly Auto Parts, have the exact part I needed, at 1/4 the cost of the actual nissan dealership's parts department (113.99 vs. 417.99, for the exact same part from same manufacturer, but because it wasn't a stocked item in-store, they were able to get it to me next day!"
2617,Enjoyed
2618,"This is one of my favorite Anchorage restaurants. A chain, yes, but consistently delicious steaks  prepared to order, the best prepared salmon in town, plus the best selection of well seasoned sides anywhere. Mixed veggies are always undercooked, is about my only complaint. Wonderfully fresh salads with all the toppings you enjoy."
2619,Love it but wish they had more food selections
2620,Great group of people. Veteran supporters. Terrific lodge on the Chena River.
2621,This is a great restaurant to go to; the staff is friendly and the food is good!
2622,My 14yr old asked for a cup of water- they made her pay $4 for it. Who does that??
2623,Good selection
2624,"Bought a 2010 gmc denali let me start a list of the things I found wrong over the months of owning it's
When you pull on the door handles they almost pull out
The driver seat had a huge hole in it from where a dog scratched at it couldn't notice it unless you like put your head under there
Looked like they tried to glue the driver handle on with glue and it ran down the door and now I have to paint the drivers door
The person that detailed it did the worst job ever and didn't wipe all the white stuff they strayed and didn't vacuum the soap off the floor boards good enough
Then went to replace my head lights and you have to take the head lights out and they were brokenot tabs and only 2 bolts holding them in and they wereally up top. Should have a total of 5 bolts holding them in and they cut the old headlights out and left the wires bare and did not close the wires right
Seems like some people arnt doing their jobs and are only doing it half ass.."
2625,Dr. Brittney Sedlacek of OPA Rheumatology has been a tremendous experience along with the administrative staff. I am glad I was referred to OPA by my primary care physician. I think the only negative is that OPA Rheumatology is not located on Kodiak. Thank you OPA Rheumatology and thank you Dr. Brittany Sedlacek.
2626,Quiet campground close to town. Plenty of large sites and no RV size restrictions
2627,Nice
2628,Beautiful!
2629,"Love the place and what it has to offer but just had a unpleasant experience due to the fact that they don't take Mastercard. This is who services my bank, so I can't ever really shop here."
2630,Nice store just wish the parts guy didn't think he knew my vehicle better than me.
2631,"I work by here and love this place. There protein smoothie is amazing. If one girl whose new makes it though doesn't taste right. To watery. But over all love there breakfast, avacados toast, and juices. Will return"
2632,Great place to go and meet friends  Everybody is friendly nice and clean one of the best places in Anchorage to go
2633,Stress relief
2634,"Awesome food, great views, and remarkable atmosphere. Staff is great! Otg loves this place!"
2635,It's a bar. They have drinks. Wasn't busy when I sat down and I was ignored by three people behind the bar for quite some time before being helped.
2636,This is a second time I am renting a car within a last two months. The car is not ready for me to pick it up.
2637,Great hotel
2638,Great place
2639,"They are amazing and caring people. I loved that I could look without someone right there. I like that I had to go get someone, they weren't far. I will recommend them to everyone."
2640,"Second time there.  Undoubtedly will go again,  provided that the Lord is willing and the river doesn't rise."
2641,"I love The Diner.  Friendly staff, good food.  I decided to try the homemade waffle and was sad to see how small it was, but it was delicious, as was the reindeer sausage I got on the side.  Great breakfast!"
2642,"AMAZING service, fantastic food, delicious juices, from now on I will be a regular"
2643,"Called in so are food was wanting, just bagging it up when I got there. Everything cooked perfect, love the toasted bun's."
2644,"My mom and I came here while I was on spring break for some mother/daughter time. When we entered, there was only 1 cashier, and there were three people having a full on conversation when there were like 50 people in line. If there aren't a lot of people here, walk out the door and come back when there are more employees on the floor, don't waste your day or time standing in line."
2645,Good selection of oriental foods however.... unfortunately it was very dirty
2646,Nice hardware
2647,"As any Applebee's, the food is good. There was a mistake on my order at first, but the service was well worth the visit. 3 out of 5."
2648,"Warm, and welcoming staff; and environment."
2649,Great
2650,This was the perfect find on our drive from Delta Junction to Fairbanks.  The breakfast selections were plentiful.  We settled on Breakfast burritos and some mac and cheese with bacon (it is vacation after all)!  Our RV was a little too big to do the drive thru but we just parked and walked up to the window.  The portions were large and very flavorful!
2651,Clothing department sucks. Doesn't carry Rider jeans for large size women.  Doesn't keep their groceries stocked up or they discontinue items that we get there.
2652,"Sparkling clean restaurant in the middle of the Alaska Winter? Uh, yes please! Seated within minutes of arrival despite peak dining hours this new location for  Sushi Ya was beautiful. Efficient wait staff and as always delicious food."
2653,Small portions.   Nice service.
2654,"Oh, I love this place!"
2655,Great food!
2656,👍
2657,"Local women's coop hand knitting all sorts of clothing: hats, scarfs, shawls, gloves, even dresses from musk ox wool. It's warmer than sheep wool, has no lanolin or itch and maintains its shape no matter what temperature of water it is washed in. A giant musk ox only produces about 5 pounds of this under coat, so it's not cheap. It is beautiful and you usually get to meet some of the knitters from the 21 remote communities involved. Each community uses different designs, which are explained. Not wheel chair accessible, but it's only 3 steps up and the shop is small, so our two people with limited mobility did fine."
2658,Excellent customer service love the buds and the buds awesome edibles
2659,"We love VCA. We had a very bad experience with a traveling vet here a few years ago, but Dr. Mandy is absolutely amazing! She is so down to earth. She actually cares about you and your pet, not about upcharging you. I love the way the office preps for your visit with a goodie bag and welcome sign 😍 Their policy of conferencing with you about the charges BEFORE they do anything just really puts me at ease. Plus, they were very kind about telling me my dog is overweight 😂 I know, I know... we both need more walks!"
2660,Thanks
2661,Very friendly staff. Comfortable rooms. Good towels. Decent lighting for a hotel.
2662,Exceptional service and reasonably priced! Thank you.

2664,Amazing
2665,Yuck
2666,They can use better staff.... But I understand teens need jobs too
2667,Always Hot and Tasty
2668,"Cool spot, really love it. It's unique. They show one of a kind films you won't see anywhere else. Worth checking out, especially for the candy. There's so much assorted candies and you can get Whatever kind you want and fill it up. It's so cool!"
2669,Nice

2674,I have purchased several holsters from these folks.  The make the finest leather chest holsters around.  Hands down!
2675,Killer Mexican food and great service.
2676,"I have yet to use their repair service but they're parts department is the best, go see Braxton he's got a strait forward attitude and needs the right info and he always hook you up with the best price on the right part! I have yet to buy a part there and have to return for the correct one. As an update 3 years or so later this parts store has still delivered on point service with the right part on hand or in hand shortly. I shop there for any real auto necessities."
2677,Nice park

2681,Parking is the most disorganized I've ever seen for whatever event they have. As a matter of fact everything about the place in disorganized. Every time i go there for an event it just gets ruined for me. Stopped going after the third time i went there.
2682,Family friendly place to eat.
2683,I'm in love with the swirl soft serve ice cream
2684,"first timer, was good, hot dogs not hot but flavor was delish. Seemed long for just a hot dog but worth it. Definitely come back."
2685,Glad to see this space resurrected into a cool breakfast and sandwich place. Creative menu. Cool space. A patio for the summer. And staff is nice as well.
2686,One of the few places in town that lists vegetarian and vegan dishes on their menu. The wife's mezze platter was quite good. And so was my Reuben.
2687,"Not surprisingly the Lowe's app lies about the locations of items, but fortunately the store employees know where things are. I recently had to return an item that was the wrong thing, my fault in selecting it, and it went smoothly. Always nice when that happens."
2688,International House Of Pancakes. IHOP makes sense now. Good food.
2689,Love their tasty soups and homemade donuts.  The lil cafe is at the far back of the store! I think this is one of the best gift shops for Alaskan memorabilia that there is!
2690,Average diner food
2691,"Excellent location in the exact center of Fairbanks. Excellent rooms, swimming pool, and staff! It couldn't be better."
2692,"For $40-ish bucks a month, you can't beat these amenities. You get cardio, free weights, spin classes, etc. etc. etc. These guys are way more affordable than the alternative. My only gripe is the carpeted locker rooms that tend to stink from time to time."
2693,"The pizza here is good, and definitely the best on the east side. They also give a nice military discount. My only gripe is that they boast about not being effected by ""Mr Inflation"" even though their pizza is the same price as everywhere else now."
2694,"Delicious food, variety of choices and very good ambience. The portions are large too so although this place is pricey if you order the right things you may not end up paying too much or wasting. Between 2 people we ordered an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. The entree came with a side salad which we upgraded to ceasar salad for just $3 extra. The server was friendly and nice. Vegetarian friendly choices"
2695,Interesting.
2696,Top shelf coffee!
2697,"The Passage Canal is a busy place!  Cruise ships to kayaks travel in and out of this area.  You'll also find shrimp pots and scuba divers, so keep your eyes open."

2711,Good pizza great price
2712,Keeping those packages on time.
2713,Great place. Especially cool when they are feeding the bears!
2714,"Awful experience. Asked for a receipt is like asking the world. Have reached out multiple times with no reply. Quoted the wrong original price, it was more expensive. They rushed my whole crown experience due to not listening to me when I had to go out of town. Then blamed me for the miscommunication. I had to be charged extra because of their mistake.
On top of that the assistant doing my crown molding was too busy chit chatting with her co worker to do her job and had to do a molding twice because of it. Just over all unprofessional and lack of customer service experience."
2715,Always terrific.
2716,They have some awesome deli food
2717,Food was very good... great service!
2718,My favorite burger place in Alaska!
2719,"They have great produce, and a great selection of groceries along with home, school, office supplies, and more."

2726,I love their free Friday downloads
2727,This was my very first time coming here and the service was excellent. The cashier walked a large group of us first tiger's through the menu and the process with an amazing attitude. The workers down the line were very attentive with our group and made sure we got just what we wanted. Upon taking my first bite I am hooked and will definitely be going back!
2728,"Great price on gas, especially if you shop at Fred Meyer, then you can get a discount with your rewards card"
2729,Great place to visit in Alaska
2730,Best hospitality. Great food. Very nice dine in.

Definitely reccommend the hollywood roll combo it was AWWSOME"

2740,"A grand old dame. I just spent extensive time backstage, and it's still in fantastic shape. And the house itself looks magnificent."
2741,"UPDATE: I took my Van into the Chrysler dealership in Anchorage after getting it back from Midas. They replaced and repaired everything I requested from Midas within 24 hours. They also found no problems with ""codes"" or or anything else other than fuses that needed to be replaced, and one sensor that was broken. Funny how none of the ""huge problems"" that made my Van such a ""disaster"" according to Midas weren't found by the dealership. I highly recommend going elsewhere.

I dropped my 2014 Chrysler Town and Country off to you guys on July 28, 2020 last week. As of this coming Tuesday, you have had it a week, no one has called to update me, and every time I have called I've been told you're still doing diagnostics. I was told no matter where I take it it has ""a lot of problems"" and you're still diagnosing them. No specifics, just that your ""guy"" was still looking at it. I would like someone to AT LEAST tell me what all these ""problems"" are by tomorrow, or I will be arranging to take it somewhere else. I brought it in saying I needed new brakes, new tires, and to please check the sensors to see what's wrong. Now I don't know if it's because I'm female, but I will not be strung along and it is driveable and able to be taken elsewhere. I would like YOU, who are charging me over $300 for diagnostics to be done(as of the 28th- I'm sure you've added to that) to give ME a call tomorrow, Monday, August 3, 2020, with an answer as to what exactly is taking so long to diagnose my vehicle, especially when I made an appointment beforehand. This is unacceptable and I'm sure you have finished work on other vehicles in this last week. The least I expect after a week of being home bound with no car, after making an appointment, is a follow up call telling me what ""a lot of problems"" SPECIFICALLY means. And even then, I will probably be taking it elsewhere to get my tires and brakes at this point. I'm pretty sure it won't take an entire week for another shop to simply tell me WHAT needs to be fixed. To my understanding you have not performed ANY work yet on my vehicle, and therefore have caused me more problems by keeping it for so long. I would like to add that I do have a lawyer as well. Either tell me what is SPECIFICALLY wrong with it,  give my vehicle back so I can find a more competent auto shop, or I'll be having my lawyer contact you. Thanks, I guess."
2742,Nice fields tucked in a nice east side neighborhood
2743,"Yak burger was delicious, service was great."
2744,"Clean, friendly, good pedicure and leg massage."
2745,So delish!! Try the lunch buffet:)!!
2746,Lots of un for kids and adults. The scenery is beautiful and sometimes the train comes by!!

2756,"They always have something on my list even if I didnt know I had a list. The staff are friendly and helpful.i never know what I'll find there today I found a good price on cute little polar bear, little green turtle and little spider shaped earnings for a good price."
2757,Made the process simple and painless.

2770,Great food and service
2771,"BBQ Wings were very tasty and the Greek Salad was good. Pizza was okay, based on all the excellent pizzas you can get in Anchorage these days. Surprising part is they offer gluten free and vegan crusts. Atmosphere is down home. I was at the Tudor location. Our server was friendly and gave good service, even as the only server on the floor. The selection of beers is good for a small place, including several favorite micro brews."
2772,Best coffee in Eagle River!!!
2773,Love the cute clothes and amazing prices. Very pish! Plus Sephora!
2774,Great bakery and place to chat while eating or drinking your purchase.
2775,A must visit place in Alaska where they offer glacier hiking and ice climbing. I took the adventure trek with Nova and I truly overcame my fear of ice climbing with our tour guides. The ice climbing and hike isn't too tiring and they go with everyone's pace but it's an experience you can't miss at Alaska. The views are gorgeous and it isn't as cold in summers. I would recommend the start of July for nice warm and sunny weather to visit this place!
2776,Ok food we need more choices in Wasilla!
2777,"Sadly just like do many other towns we saw on the trip, not Hong really different"
2778,Good food.  The beautiful live flowers just made the whole place just special

2794,"I went with high hopes. The best I can say is that the service was good, and the place was nice and clean. The breakfast food was not good. The bacon, for example, was overcooked and had a strange flavor that backfired on me for the rest of the day. Everything was edible, but for the price, it needed to be so much more than just edible."

2807,"Loved it! Went for my birthday with my mom and boyfriend. The theatrics and performance from the chef were amazing and the food was phenomenal. Dinner and a show taken to a whole new level; don't come here to have a long conversation that spans the whole meal, you'll be too busy watching."

As well as explaining what the best route on medication for sick fish!  A must go place!!"
2827,"Everything we've ever gotten here has been absolutely amazing. We love their pizzas and beer! My husband loves the Golden Dall & Just the Tip beers. Only tiny complaint is the 'Colossal' Elk meat ball, isn't as colossal as you'd think... Lol but everything's delicious and service is always great. Love the outdoor dining with a view!"
2828,Helped me out a lot. Did not just let me buy what I wanted. They helped me get the set of tires that worked best for me and got me in and out in a timely manner
2829,Take the class...buying or selling!
2830,Did a paint nite there and the service during was excellent.
2831,Always a good place to go for the pride and the 4th and many other events

Mistreat their employees
Fake
Need bulgarians and Taiwanese and hipster transient drug addicts cuz mo decent person would allow their self to be treated like that"
2835,"Everytime I go there, which was pretty frequent, they are always short on something or missing something. The last time I went they only had one type of bread at 6pm 5 hours before they close. The lettuce was mostly brown, the soda machine also was flat, they failed to use my subway app even though I scanned it and for some reason their prices are higher then the other locations near by. I will never be going to this subway location again"

2841,Great prices
2842,The best local coffee house in Alaska! Great Raspberry Redbull Italian Sodas!
2843,"Friendly service and sufficient menu items. Everything is great about this place.....

I'm finding that over time the bagels are not as plump, as they initially were.  The blueberry and cinnamon raisin bagels have minimal content (raisins and blueberries) Also items are frequently sold out as well. Burnt everything bagels too.

What's happened to the quality control!  I think they have let the quality of the product namesake (bagels), diminish significantly.

The coffee beverages are still fantastic though.

I will still drop in occasionally to see if quality improves, but until then I find it difficult to frequent on a regular basis"

2849,Reliable for car washes most of the time. Went once and there was still a bunch of soap on the car. Free vacuum's though...I think if I remember correctly.
2850,"If I could give them negative stars I would. I have never seen a place as sketchy and questionable as Gene’s. Not only do they have poor customer service but I bet they don’t even fully inspect the used vehicles that they put on the sales floor. You would think that because they are a dealership that they would fully inspect the vehicle and make sure to check and double check everything to make sure that it runs properly. Their customer service is a joke, between answering phone calls whilst in a conversation with you or just completely ignoring your requests, they are essentially just rude and careless. They just care about securing their commission and if that means that they put you in a faulty vehicle then that’s what they will do. Even after expressing my frustration and concerns they just kept saying that they couldn’t do anything for me and then turn around and say that they just want to make their customers happy to then still say they can’t help you. They have had my vehicle from 8:30 until 4:30 to tell me that a cap was broken, something that should have been noticed and fixed before putting the vehicle on the sales floor. Every person that I have spoken to about my experience with Gene’s and their employees they all have told me that they are the worst people to work with when it comes to purchasing a vehicle. I just wish I would have known this before even thinking about going to them."

We had a Greek salad (not good at all) and two lunch special consisting of Caesar salad (good), Buffalo salad (really good), a White slice (really good), and a Cheese slice (good). The beers made everything better, the restrooms were clean, and service was good. Reminds me of a TGI Friday with more class."

3043,Its ok here it's ok not a whole lot to make me want to go back though....
3044,"Edit: Horrible customer service too, dealing with them through emails is horrible. I hope you never have a problem with your order and have to deal with Corporate, they just dont care about customers, even the local Hardrock management.

Wasn't my favorite. Asked for no Tomatoes in the nachos and the beans that we're on it included tomatoes. Informed the waiter he might want to know that. Grilled chicken on the nachos we're ice cold not sure if that is normal?? Wasn't very appealing at all, burnt chips, cold chicken horrible flavor."

3049,"Been coming to Chepos for many many years. Especially for birthdays and celebrations, as the staff always takes care of us and the food is great."
3050,"Easy to get to. The trail is not strenuous. Depending on which loops you take, you can take a short walk or hike for hours. The trails and turns are all very well marked. A great place to hike, take the dogs, mountain bike. I imagine in the winter it will be awesome for snowshoeing and cross country skiing as well."
3051,Best coffee ever
3052,"My partner also demands the old lady herself gets 5 stars.

Wonderful little Japanese place, so Japanese in fact, the tables are lower than my legs allow vertically.

3066,I spend a lot of money here.
3067,"Very cool place to visit. Not many can say they've been this far north. Long day trip, but can be done in one day from Fairbanks.  Rest stop at Finger Mountain just before sign is good place for snacks or meals before heading back."

3072,4 star because they only accept cash.
3073,"Employees and Manager were all so very kind, considerate, respectful, knowledgeable, understanding,  and knew their jobs very well. Rooms are seemingly dated but can't beat the prices,  and with the staffing and managing as welcoming and helpful as they are, had a very comfortable, family and home-like atmosphere. Couldn't have been a better home away home. We will definitely be back! Thanks so much! Don't have an account of our own so wrote this review under our & friends account, hope that is ok! Keep up the bright shinning y'all! Thank you!"
3074,"First time I've tried the alfredo pasta it was AMAZING. The second time I went,the pasta was too hard and the sauce was a little more on the salty side. But either than that,they have good breadsticks and the house salad was good as well. A little too pricey for the portions. But they have great customer service."
3075,"Food is very expensive, service is adequate, but I left extremely full. The food is tasty and the ambiance is perfect for a sports bar/grill."

3078,Very  very Pleasant helpful and tasty
3079,"We went there the night before New Year's Eve to celebrate, and the experience was fantastic! If you're able to find some coupons, definitely use them. Our party of five got two Campfire Feast meals for $47 each that included an appetizer, two entrées, and a dessert. Tons of great food for the price, that's for sure.

The service here is great. In particular, our server Jonathan made it a great dinner. He was funny, polite, helpful, and overall one of the best servers I've had in a while. Props to him for making a great restaurant even better!

Overall, this is a great place to go for special occasions. Probably a little expensive without coupons to go very often, but it's worth it when you're there."
3080,good place to shop

3087,Beautiful place!
3088,"Great food and great service. I wish they were open later but i get, they have a small hard working crew."
3089,"Compact and clean space, great staff and good products.

3091,Best Mexican in town!
3092,Awesome place
3093,Donovan was amazing. He helped me get a vehicle I could afford. He went above and beyond what I have ever experienced in helpfulness and courtesy. I really appreciate the help he gave me. I love my beautiful blue fiesta!
3094,This restaurant is as old as I am. That means that it has done a good job feeding the people of Anchorage and they've done it for a long time. It has that old Mexican Villa feel the food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. The Margaritas were yummy and the service was great. This was the first time that we've eaten at La Mex but it will not be the last. Very nice place to enjoy Mexican food
3095,"This rental car business is great. They have very reasonable prices and their cars are pretty well taken care of considering its Anchorage, meaning some dings and scratches and nicks in the windshield but still nice and drive straight. I also like that it was blue tooth compatible so I could listen to music from my phone and use Google maps and it would talk through the car stereo. Check out and check in were a breeze."
3096,The local people working there try but corporate headquarters throws a lot of lower 48 rules in the way.
3097,Very nice
3098,"I went to eat at Tubbys, but there menu had been reduced. We ended up with some charred burgers. It was the best experience."

3106,High blood pressure from the sesame chicken & fried rice.
3107,Great place. My favorite of the Fred Meyer stores.
3108,Always good food with a short wait time.
3109,Love this place!
3110,"Good music, good atmosphere. The service is good, they don't rush you to order - the menu is long, so many options. The wait was not too long once the food is ordered. Make sure to ask about what sauce or toppings you're getting if you're not sure, my friends didn't love the yellow sauce and mayo that was drizzled on the rolls they got."
3111,"So much cool stuff, I can't spend less than an hour there. Good prices too. You can go to Lowe's and buy a clamp for $20, or go here and get 4 of them for $20 that clamp just as well!"

3122,"Nice store and there is a pretty good selection... However when ever I go there I feel like they are racial profiling me. I say that because every time I go there thier ""secret shoppers"" (not so secret cuz they easy AF to spot... Tell em step thier game up 🤷😂) always start following me almost as soon as I walk in the door. And I have never stolen from there in my life... Racist f**kers."
3123,Great!  Saw glaciers & wildlife.
3124,Close and convenient
3125,Great food with an amazing view!!
3126,Love the food
3127,"Very high level of refinement in coffee and snacks, but the prices are probably twice what they should be(I mean, $15 for a flat bread that isn't even kept in a warmer...). Fresh-ground is here also"
3128,Security in they're parking lots is a joke.. expect your car to get broken into if locked and homeless sleeping in it if not.

3141,Typical laundromat.
3142,YMCA is great
3143,"Great help when I was looking for hiking shoes. Not just technical knowledge, but experience owning and using them."

3146,Great spirits
3147,Great place to get a haircut.  Love the people who work especially  Christina.
3148,The employees are always happy and so nice !
3149,"It's a hit or miss , not gonna lie some of there food are good , it's just it's not consistent(maybe cause of staffing? Or budget restrictions?) , That's why  most of the times that they serve good food it gets immediately overlooked because the next meal ends up being the reverse or even worse."
3150,Largely state offices with 0 security to keep drunks out.
3151,"Great part of Alaska. Don't miss it if your visiting South-Central Alaska.
The view is as great as the food."

3167,This is a hit or miss place last time I got donut holes half were good 1/2 sucked
3168,We were there in the summer and paid outrageous rates.  It's a nice hotel.  Bathroom was a bit rough with a recent terrible paint job.
3169,Took about 10 minutes for my parmesan cheese sliders to be done. The parmesan cheese sliders has that just out of the oven taste but they weren't too hot. The buns tastes like they h were made withsome sort  rosemary  bread really good .  The parmesan cheese sliders were very flavorful
3170,Nice people make a difference. Very family friendly place.
3171,"Service was rather slow, the onion rings were hot and cooked well but had an off taste like they are cooked with cake or waffle cones. The sonic burger i got tasted ok but wasnt hot when I got it. The young man who brought me my food was extremely nice and helpful and I did make sure to tip him. I will try again here in a few weeks to see if it's any better."
3172,"Renee is great!!!  She always listens to what I want, and also gives great advice about what hairstyles will look good with my head shape.  Overall, I have gone to her several times and have always been very pleased!  Decent pricing as well - my haircut was $45 and included styling."

3175,This Campground is a very nice Campground very picturesque and absolutely clear water..

3177,"Fresh, Hot"
3178,"I absolutely love the food, but the service is always lacking when we go."
3179,"It's Walmart, fairly clean, lotsa stuff."

3183,Love it!
3184,Fair service and quality of beer
3185,"Best chicken sandwich ever! I saw the commercial and had to try it, and I dont like fast food. It was worth the trip! Real homestyle fried chicken in a bun! Yummy! There was a long line when I got there, but they were fast and my order was correct! You guys rocked it!"
3186,Good
3187,"You  cant get more stars when your out of brisket and smoked chx.  Pulled pork was better than most. Sauces are weak and just ehhh.....
Nothing to write home about but not bad. Perhaps worth a second chance but i dont see being wowed either. Your call"
3188,The people are always helpful and Lowes offers military discounts on everything unlike their major competition.

3195,"Great brews on rotation. Excellent service, the best in town.  Good food and snacks in the Loft."
3196,I love this place! All times of year it is worth a visit.
3197,"I like the over the phone payment system, except you have to wait for that lady to go through all the same stuff EVERYTIME... It was an easy process to start service & I didn't have to go see anyone in person, which was nice... I had a bit of a time trying to pre-pay on my bill tho, when the woman on the phone told me she couldn't bring up my account because my service hadn't started yet... So I never did get to pre-pay on my bill because the money ended up getting used for other bills before they could bring up my account... But, they sure don't waste time sending you a shut off notice, my bill this month was over $300, last month $340!!! & over half of that is FEES for THEIR stuff... fuel for their plant $71, other misc fees $50+... I was happy that it was only $25 to start service (down in Kenai it was $200), but now I know why... I know people  who own houses & their gas AND electric bills together don't run this high! & THEN if your service is shut off, it's $41 to get it turned back on DURING business hours ONLY or $87 after hours & $372!!! for a call-out reconnect, whatever that is... It's just stupid that they're the ONLY electric company, so you can't go anywhere else & you HAVE to pay all their stupid fees... Even if I had a full time job at $15/hr I couldn't afford a $300+ electric bill on top of my rent! We only have the heat on in ONE room in our apartment, no computers, LED light bulbs, 2 ECOSmart TVs that auto-shut off after a set amount of time & we only use cold water in our washing machine & don't even use the dishwasher! We even shut off the water to one of the toilets, just incase it's pulling hot water!!! There's no reason our bill should be so high!"
3198,Excellent customer service and fair prices; bonus they are willing to put in a part you purchase and bring in.
3199,"Very helpful and honest when dealing with you. They provide options, explain the difference in IDs (Real ID vs. Federal) and ensure you know everything necessary to make the process smooth. The place does look shady and weird from the outside, and the main entrance is inside the trailer sales lot at the moment due to renovations in the main building."
3200,Lovely quaint farmers market with a wide variety for our small town.
3201,Great food everytime
3202,I have loved The Awakenings great coffee and awesome friendly service
3203,Great food. Great environment. Definitely worth waiting for
3204,"Nice fancy restaurant, clean and food tasted great.
I got sea food Risotto and it was so delicious 😋"
3205,"I really enjoyed this hotel! They recently had a refresh and it totally shows. I loved the west elm decor - that is a star partnership. I particularly like the comfortable couch/trundle bed. The suite sizes are very nice compared to some of the other anchorage hotels. Also their was some really great people at customer service. They stored our bags while we went camping in denali and they were able to provide a lake checkout. It was a great stay for me! The one downside is they have not updating the cooling system so the AC was a little loud and not very effective considering the heat. Lastly, the mini fridge was very odd and only stayed cold for 2 hours at a time which is basically not effective."
3206,Good regional beer selection!
3207,There is something about the sauce that makes pizza hut pizza so good.
3208,Clean and well priced
3209,jack in the box is better priced and tastes like smashburger. should have opened a jack in the box instead.
3210,Never trust the dealer... All broken promises.
3211,Great for organic everything $$
3212,Friendly and efficient staff.
3213,"About the only thing this place has going for it is Guy Fieri visited it once. Where do I even start?

We've been here 3 times and each time it's been awful. Super loud and crowded. The service is ok.

The food is downright bad. We got lunch our first time. My kids food was cold like they put it on a plate and stuck it to the side for 10 minutes to make ours. The burger we got was dry and we didn't get through half of it and we shared the meal.

Month's go by and we try it again. Breakfast this time. Once again my poor 3 year old was given the coldest food possible. It came out in a record 4 minutes. Her waffle was cold wet and soggy, telling me they made it awhile ago and probably had a bunch in a tray. Her eggs were rubbery too and soggy like they sat in a tray. Ours wasn't much better

Time 3 was better service wise but food was the same. I'm definitely not going back which is sad because this place has potential"
3214,Great place to eat at and not have to go all the way into Fairbanks. Good food and very family oriented
3215,Expensive but nice
3216,Best place in town
3217,Food was good and staff was friendly
3218,"I love this mall. It has different levels and jyst about anything you want. Kids could ice skate while you shop. Some after kids get out of school take them all to the YMCA. The kids can swim or play basketball, work out with weights, whatever they choose while mom soaks in a salt bath. After you are done, all take showers. Then eat from one of the many excellent eateries and you can just about guarantee kids are ready for bed. And dad is happy and mom is relaxed. A win win!"
3219,God home cooked food and lots of humorously Snarky comments all over that had us laughing.
3220,"A lot of things to do, great indoor fun for kids"
3221,It has every thing non healthy but it's not me so get on the fat-back diet
3222,The employees are very good and will help you find the right part or parts you need .

3227,Service was great and the food was delicious!! I would definitely come back.
3228,Great place close to town to go riding. Marked trails to make it all the way to the glacier. Bummer  they're trying to charge now at the parking lot. Literally they have no right to!
3229,Yummy crepes!!😁
3230,Twice I've tried this place both times the service was sub par. The food was only ok at the very best. I really don't know what they were thinking putting bbq pork on a Cuban sandwich. And the bacon jam burger isn't as good as everyone led me to believe. I won't go back.
3231,Best custom sound and auto start installation. They can even add lights and graphics to your custom box.
3232,Family favorite. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.
3233,Closest point to watch Denali peaks.
3234,"Fast, simple, easy, price a little high tho"

3239,Good vibes! Love this place!
3240,"Overpriced pho. Ordered a large seafood pho and it came with minimal seafood. A few bites of squid, a couple fish balls, four small shrimps..."
3241,Clerks are pretty helpful and if they don't stock a particular product they generally have a good suggestion of where else you'd be able to find it.
3242,Minor help if any.
3243,Yummy
3244,Good
3245,"One of our favorites and food and drinks are both delicious! Love the blue cheese salad and their Nachos at picture worthy as they are piled high and about 8"" tall. The ravioli is delish as well as the blackened chicken curry!"
3246,"They got rid of the Turkey burger, that makes me sad!"
3247,Food could've been better
3248,"Very good Mexican food,  made by actual Mexicans.  I had a chili relleno that was delicious  and I know they are a huge pain to make  ."

3257,"A great theater. Clean, loud, lots of snacks."

3260,4 star food with 5 star service
3261,Great prices. Can be crowded during busy hours L but worth it for the deals
3262,I bought something online finding a store near me. The had 2 available for pick up. I paid. And then I receive a message that they did not have any in stock and my purchase was canceled... but it was not! It was charged. I tried calling. The employee who answered was rude and just sent me to the manager. The manager was “too busy”. This is ridiculous
3263,"Steak and fish were good, and the service was good. Lighting is a little weird inside but overall a clean place."
3264,Love their food! Enjoying the Two for $6 roast beef n cheddar!!  Their sides are spendy but some days they are worth it!
3265,Good.. always check your orders..lol lil any drive thru.
3266,Nice friendly place. Good food also
3267,"They have feed, seed. Pet supplies. Garden and yard  care, and things you can't find anywhere else. Fun just to go in and browse.  Very friendly helpful staff."
3268,"I had the happy accident of finding Rebecca on Groupon 5 years ago. I've never been anywhere since. The cleanliness, knowledge and professionalism offered at Face Forward are second to none."
3269,Very beautiful
3270,Loved it
3271,Chipotle but better.
3272,"This is one of the best parking spot in down town area. First hours free, next hours are $1 an hour. Its covered, connected to the 5th Ave mall and pretty easy to get on and out of the building."
3273,Nice viewpoint in the city
3274,Wasnt super packed on Tuesday afternoon. Great food.
3275,Table six is one of my regular places. There beer selection is awesome and the burgers are yummy. The service has always been great.
3276,"Its KFC, what do you need to know"
3277,+3★s for the location convenience and famous discount-rack. -2★'s for the often high priced products and lack of variety.
3278,A bit pricey but great products
3279,Tourist trap!  Chocolate fountain only thing worth seeing.
3280,Awesome place!! 1/2 down 4th st from the iditerod start. Owner and staff were Very cool!! Reindeer dogs were fantastic and hot off the grill!!
3281,"I will start with when calling to make reservations the staff was very courteous and professional on the phone and able to get our reservations made.  We rolled in very tired in the early morning they made check in a breeze.  The hotel is very much Alaska!  The rooms were clean, comfortable and stocked.  In these trying ""covid"" times they made things work so we were able to have a light breakfast.  Both desk and cleaning staff were pleasant and professional.   We will stay here again!  Thanks guys for making our trip outstanding."
3282,What a great convenience store with a wonderful staff
3283,"My girlfriend loves it here, so in return, I do too for reasons."
3284,Excited the Bath and Bodyworks is open again! 🙂
3285,Very good to get our food and so much more.
3286,Amazing place to bring your children
3287,This place has a great atmosphere and great food. They always hold events there. It is located right off the highway. I always enjoy my time when I am there. The Servers and BarTenders are very friendly.
3288,Really good pizza at a decent price. Great for parties
3289,Food we good but it took way too long to get it. I don’t know how everyone around us got their food in good time. My food which was the cheek (halibut) was bland roughly half way through it but then it tased really good.
3290,Definitely one of the best around! High pressure and an 8' bay for those that need the clearance!
3291,Quality is good service is real good.....
3292,"""Dopest dope ive ever smoked"""
3293,"Good place to pop in for a scoop of ice cream, and more....."

3295,Love their original donuts. Yummy
3296,Pricey because it's in the middle of town but the room itself was very good quality and clean
3297,Lots of ice no whales
3298,Well stocked grocery store for such a remote place. They had everything we needed for our 4 night stay in the area. They are not open 24 hours a day so plan ahead for your midnight munchies and ice cream.
3299,You get what you get from a craft store. The staff has always been friendly.
3300,Great location.
3301,Never again!
3302,Great food; great staff; reasonable prices and parking usually available within a few steps of the door.
3303,Disappointed did not see puffins or whales and it is extremely expensive.
3304,Too expensive and the reserve seating concept is stupid.  Like the reclining seats tho.
3305,Eggcellent breakfast and service
3306,Great Hotel an the staff was as well...
3307,Get the Mac and Cheese!
3308,👍
3309,Bam!
3310,"Usually this place is really good, sometimes it is a little disappointing.  The Deadliest Catch is great, but their hashes, pancakes, everything is good.  Sometimes it just feels like they are having an off day and your crab/salmon cakes dry.  Definitely a bit too expensive for the quality of food you get, and it seems over hyped... make sure to make a reservation."
3311,Room was incredibly warm but an okay stay for 1 night.
3312,Million dollar view. Average service and food.
3313,Absolutely amazing and authentic! Never fails to make a tummy happy!
3314,"Overall happy with our rv rental! We did experience a flat while renting it, but dont expect them to fix it, we called and was told where to find all the tools and the tire. Our hot water heater only worked on gas, not electric, which it was suppose to work on both, but they didnt charge us for the propane fill up which was fair."
3315,Excellent
3316,This place is popular with locals. Family friendly. Wait for a table can exceed 30min.
3317,The very BEST CARROT CAKE EVER

3321,Bathroom are very clean
3322,"Nice n friendly group of employees, definitely makes the experience better"
3323,"Pretty poor hotel. Their own staff on guest floors at 2,3 and 4 am (in fact right now) talking aloud and playing music? No swimming pool ( broken and has been for months) old dirty building and rooms. TV doesnt work well (always looking for signal) disgusting place really. If the management repond to this review, enter the code: 4671 in your reply"
3324,"This was the best Goodwill I've ever seen! The store is huge, and the stock was plentiful."
3325,Always busy prepare for a long line great prices and almost always have what you are looking for

3333,Pretty nice Poole
3334,"Fast, friendly, normal prices, good parking."
3335,It's much better than before more upbeat food is well priced
3336,"They are snobs, they never call back plus the unwillingness to help. I have purchased  mittens,  and other things. The product is ok but way better price and way better customer service other places like Big rays. Better product for the price. Apocalypse  is unhelpful at all aspects, i have asked for help over the phone and left full message as well as number on 3 different  occasions over the the last 12 years and nothing but crickets. Buy Canadian goods as they are way better suited for the arctic and for mushing  the kenai area has way better products.

3337,Great Irish Pub with a slight Boston based theme.
3338,"I liked this place. Good food and beer, super casual atmosphere."

3340,My husband had a stroke and shouldn't have been made to go back on the ice and 50 mph winds to get down to the conference room
3341,Very good pizza without the long wait times.
3342,Worth the stop .
3343,Best place in Alaska for hockey gear and figure skating equipment.
3344,My favorite place to eat in Juneau. Best burger hands down too.
3345,"Had an pedicure at 10:30. They over booked and kept saying ""2 minutes"". 11 came along and they let 2 other people go in front of me. Ridiculous."
3346,"Unique bar old Chinese restaurant decor, foods not consistent"
3347,Place always has great prices and friendly help...
3348,"Open 24 hours, really good food and good coffee."
3349,Chill
3350,"Great place for private parties, and weddings."
3351,"Love this place. Always great to pick up a fresh hot pizza which is the perfect temperature to eat by the time I get it home!!  Now if I could just get my kids to order the right toppings instead of just plain pepperoni, life would be fantastic!!"
3352,Spacious venue I recently watched fluffy here it was a great experience!
3353,Kids love coming here but it's very expensive
3354,"They are between owners now so the hours are all whacky. I remember liking them previously before the change, I hope that they figure it out and get back to their regular schedule and food. I really liked their selection before because they always had a gluten free option and healthier fare."
3355,Amazing in all they do!
3356,#alittlespendy#
3357,Terrible excuse for Mexican food
3358,"Sunday's are a little crazy, starts to die down in the afternoon though."
3359,"The food was great.  Had halibut tacos & fried ice cream.  Waitress/ bartender was very personable & friendly.  Super casual, relaxed, outdoor table.  Heard it was crazy busy during summer but we were there in the middle of the week after the main tourist season.  Plan on going back to try some of the other menu items."
3360,Everything we need to get for a fishing trip. No one to help
3361,"Clean, efficient and accessible"
3362,Little plate for the $
3363,Only went here to pick up food for someone else but it looks like they have really good food
3364,As far as far as McDonald's go this ones pretty good. Just got a renovation with new ordering screens on top of the already existing drive thru and dine in ordering. This McDonald's is pretty community oriented too.
3365,"Spend on some things, normal retail. Clean place and friendly staff."
3366,It's clean
3367,Top ramen tastes better. I really regret taking my wife's family here based on the rating. I've never been more dissatisfied with food. Please stop searing one two sides of the steamed gyoza.
3368,"Just finished lunch, thought the place to be quite pleasant, professional, and great food and at a reasonable price!"
3369,"Relaxed, cozy spot in downtown Anchorage to enjoy an espresso drink and soup, a sandwich, or maybe a pastry. They do a great job with their K-Bay roasted coffee and it often includes latte art, which is a nice touch. Sports gear is available for check out near the counter for those who are heading upstairs to The Rooftop. They have a changing installation of local art, photography, and things of that nature. Unfortunately, it's often chilly here in winter due to the position of their doors.  Seating isn't comfy or cooshy, just hard chairs and benches. This isn't a problem, but is definitely worth knowing if you were thinking about coming to settle in for a bit with a laptop or whatever."
3370,"Pretty great food as always, pretty busy on the pub side which isn't new. Service has always been great for me and just about everyone I know. They've always got new specials, and the avalanche is probably the best pizza in existence."
3371,"Great food, and fast service.   Love the Larb.    He's not scared get it good and spicy if you want."
3372,Love it
3373,My fave biz
3374,"Rip off! Cheaper to order off Amazon! Went to have my temper glass face cover replaced on my Google Pixel 1 phone  for the second time and they wanted to charge $7 dollars I guess to install it?. It was suppose to have lifetime warranty. False advertising, cheaper to purchase on line (Amazon $2.50 free shipping) and have your cell company place it on for free."
3375,The new bike trails are so much fun!
3376,"A must do experience for all this is at its best in all aspects of entertainment,food&beverage staff is well trained and helpful"
3377,"(Translated by Google) Woohhh

3381,"Pioneer Park is a great place to play with the kids, encounter local artisans, and get a taste of Fairbanks early years as you walk through Goldrush Town. Tons of fun and budget friendly."
3382,Nice staff and great food
3383,"The museum is largely limited to a ""trophy room"" with photos, trophies, and memorabilia.There is a shop offering clothing and related items. Outside, there may be a demonstration of sled dogs pulling a wheeled cart and you can take a short circular ride for a fee."
3384,A great Christian store. You can find any Christian thing you want or need!

3395,"Good, cars didn't have cruise control even though it was ordered"
3396,"Quick service,great pie!"
3397,Pretty expensive for a small sandwich. Pretty slow too. But still a yummy sandwich and the gentleman who made my sandwich was very polite and nice.
3398,Flavorless and expensive
3399,"About the only thing this place has going for it is Guy Fieri visited it once. Where do I even start?

We've been here 3 times and each time it's been awful. Super loud and crowded. The service is ok.

The food is downright bad. We got lunch our first time. My kids food was cold like they put it on a plate and stuck it to the side for 10 minutes to make ours. The burger we got was dry and we didn't get through half of it and we shared the meal.

Month's go by and we try it again. Breakfast this time. Once again my poor 3 year old was given the coldest food possible. It came out in a record 4 minutes. Her waffle was cold wet and soggy, telling me they made it awhile ago and probably had a bunch in a tray. Her eggs were rubbery too and soggy like they sat in a tray. Ours wasn't much better

Time 3 was better service wise but food was the same. I'm definitely not going back which is sad because this place has potential"
3400,Superb sweet deals my have
3401,Its a gas station...... they sell gas. It's similarly priced to other gas stations.
3402,Good customer service
3403,"Saltwater pool, great exercise room.
Robes and slippers too."
3404,"They have put a locked cemented steel gates on every trail and dirt road access from the highway into the forest,preventing locals access to Beatle kill firewood the we locals cut for firewood an to kill an remove thee Beatle killed infested forest. They coller the moose an other forest critters with a 99% death rate. The is another Democrat (Mercowsky) Ak.senator's lockout of the American people.It does the same to the feords, there is no one out there except Alaska's adventurers, middle an poor."
3405,My first time here was to see the Star Wars: Rogue One with a group and it was extremely fun.  I would definitely suggest getting here early for very popular movies like this one as parking can be tricky and there are a lot of places near that will results in getting you towed if your not paying attention.  The food and drinks were of course excellent.  This was my first time seeing Rogue One and I was concerned that this type of dinner and movie type of experience would detract from that however the screen/3D quality was good and it's hard to complain when being able to drink your favorite ale while seeing a move on the big screen. :)  Is it on the more expensive side?  I'd say it is however to get Moose's Tooth food/drinks while watching a movie makes for an extra special experience.
3406,Just fine
3407,The staff was awesome
3408,Good services and access.  A little too close to the highway.
3409,Many different stores here something for everyone
3410,Cool old dive tavern....cool bartenders and good prices.
3411,"While in Fairbanks, Alaska we visited this center. It was very informative and interesting. They had a lot of information on the different tribes of Alaska. Really enjoyed it and it was free."
3412,Great local roaster and great coffee and staff.
3413,Don't get the fish!
3414,Awesome service
3415,"One of my favorite Japanese places in Anchorage. Always awesome food and service. Clean, friendly, and moderately priced."
3416,"It's a small store, but it's packed with traditional Mexican foods, and items that you can't find anywhere else in Anchorage. Very friendly owner and employees. The owner welcomed me as a new customer, and offered to order anything that they don't stock already.

Having grown up in a Small Town on the border in Arizona, I  cook a lot of Mexican food from scratch. It's nice to have a store that stocks the ingredients. I highly recommend Mexico Lindo."
3417,Fun date. Pizza was small put ok for the price
3418,"Been stuck in the drive thru for over 20 minutes, haven't moved at all, completely blocked in, called in, ..No answer, waited an additional 15 minutes, still no car movement, called again and asked what's the hold up, lady said they are waiting on the bacon, say what???"
3419,"Beautiful scenery! Their short winter tour is reasonably priced and you get plenty of time to visit with the dogs (including the puppies 😍) afterwards.  Unfortunately, the only available toilet is a *small* porta-potty. With little kids dressed in many layers due to the -30F weather, let's just say it is a real challenge!"
3420,Always amazing coffee.
3421,Best restaurant in north pole!
3422,The only place to stay on base.
3423,Great place just outside of Anchorage to stop and walk your dog or just plain relax after getting out of the city.
3424,Only cheap store
3425,the lowest in lowest quality products but has the best prices on some of the name brand stuff thou.
3426,"Beautiful views!  We booked the romance package for a mini staycation and it was wonderful.

The rooms could use some updating, the bed was a bit too firm, and parking can get packed during skiing season though.

It’s definitely a must do in the Anchorage area!"
3427,This is my favorite place to be out in nature.
3428,Great food and service. Highly recommended.
3429,$5 Friday is awesome
3430,food is pretty good & the value is decent.   try the muscles in white wine sauce is awesome!  i could make a meal just out of those myself but don't be afraid to anything that sounds good there because it will be good.
3431,Great service with a smile and a joke.
3432,"I stopped here to eat my dinner a few times, it has a very nice view. Good for fresh air, a great place for photography."
3433,Authentic taste
3434,I like the view of the city
3435,"Bosco's has been my goto for comics, collectable card games and geeky stuff for 25 years. From anime to wizards of the coast they have a plethora of cool stuff. Some people may complain about thier prices, but I'd rather pay a little more to buy local than wait for Amazon or eBay. I stopped in three days before Christmas and within 15 minutes found gifts for two of my hard to shop for family members."
3436,"Like many Cabela's, great place for gear, advice and a fun place to just walk around. Bargain cave always has great deals, fishing department is always stocked with anything you need to get out in the water. The native aquarium is always a joy to look at, especially at feeding times"
3437,Good cleaning
3438,It's walmart.....
3439,"Just had a great experience with American Tire & Auto. The tire pressure light was on for my moms car and she didnt listen to me that it was just the cold, -10 degree farenheit, weather. So they not only filled the tires with some air but they also did a check of the tires to verify that there was no puncture, causing a slow leak. We were on and out very quick, very cheap and very satisfied."
3440,They misspelled Kurger Bing
3441,Such a beautiful part of Alaska. Scenery is endless
3442,"Huge selection of teas, spices and condiments. Great gifting options. Convenient location."
3443,Love it!
3444,Love Costco
3445,"To date, the absolute best Park we have ever been to.  The Riley Creek campground,  the Visitor center,  the bus tours, the amazing views and wildlife.   Trip of a lifetime."
3446,"I have been here twice, and been assisted by two different people. Both times was treated well, and left with exactly what I needed taken care of.

Generally I have a much better experience here than at the one near Walmart."
3447,Nice place
3448,Talk about GREAT food! Fast & friendly service! Will definitely come back for more. Highly recommend!!! Thank you!
3449,Epic trails
3450,"Thank you!!!!!!!!!
Eagle River Automotive fixed the Sway Bars and Battery on my Jeep Wrangler. The work was fast and I appreciate the honest assessment on my vehicle. I had thought my alternator was bad but after your help it turns out I was wrong.

Thanks again,
Eagle River Automotive your awesome!!!!!!!!!!"
3451,"I'm sorry that I can't give more than 4 stars right now. My fiancee just got a diagnosis of spondylolithesis(I think I spelled that wrong but, oh well), and hasn't been ""worked on"" yet. But they did give a correct diagnosis over Providence's Rheumatoid Arthritis. I hope that I can give a better rating later."
3452,Was not expecting such a great menu in Healy. Great beers and great food. Try the Yak Burger.
3453,Excellent fish tacos and service
3454,Beautiful quiet place.
3455,I'll be back!
3456,I've been going here for years it is a great place to take the kids and eat good food and a reasonable price.
3457,Loved being here when it was quiet and tourist free (except me).  Nice to have a couple drinks with locals.  Let the Jameson flow!
3458,Good food but prices have gotten too high
3459,Nice
3460,"Amazing service and amazing people, love going here for our kitties"
3461,"Not my first time here, this last however was disappointing. Maybe it's C19 but the Tom Ka soup was hot but the pork was dry and anemic looking, and no noodles. $15 for two cups of soup and no noodles? And the sidewalk noodles w/pork (also anemic) was almost tasteless, just a clump of barely warm noodles stuck together in a styrofoam tray. $16. $31 out the door. Sorry, there are much better values out there."
3462,Fabulous selection. Great service. Lots of delicious treats to munch on too!
3463,Overly complicated
3464,"Fantastic seats and the best selection of concessions in town! I don't get out often enough to justify the upgraded membership, but it seems like a solid deal as well."
3465,"BKs $4.99 special is great, 2 mix or match burgers or chicken with choice of fries or onion rings and a drink makes a full meal for s great low price"
3466,"This place is legit. Smells fishy inside but the food is awesome. Best bulgogi in town. Fried rice is great. They usually only have one waitress so yea..but, great food."
3467,Even though winter
3468,"Pancakes were fluffy, bacon was crispy. What more could you want?"
3469,Had the lasagna.  Tasted good but was not hot enough.  Parts of it were room temp.
3470,"A small place, with about 15 nice ice sculptures. A short demonstration of ice sculpturing."
3471,The doctors at the emergency room are terrible 😣😖😖😖😖 I felt as bad going out as I did coming in but take my insurance
3472,Gr8t place
3473,"I always like North Face... Good yuppie outdoors clothing. Nothing bad to say about the clothing, however employees need to learn their product. Mind you this is ""The"" North Face store in Anchorage... Couldn't tell me what produce would fit my needs after i gave a full run down of requirements ...i ended up finding what I was looking for at REI, it was their jacket. Seemed as though chatting about employee parking was more of a concern than helping clients make a purchase... Mind you this stuff isn't cheap, least a person could get is some attention and someone that knows what they are talking about."
3474,"A good place for a quick getaway for the weekend, however expensive. If your an Alaskan resident make sure to tell them so you get the resident discount. The hot springs pool is great to sit in for a short time during the winter months, just be careful not get your hair wet while outside or your just asking for a cold the following weekend. Ice bar serves only 1 drink which is apple martini in a ice glass for $20, however there is a nice size bar and restaurant in the main building. There’s several adventure packages to choose from on their website. There is absolutely no cell phone service there unless you pay for WiFi for a certain amount of hours. Takes about an hour from Fairbanks to Chena Hot Springs. Nice to visit in summer days but too hot to swim."
3475,"I understand that places get busy, but a 20 minute wait for a couple glasses of water is ridiculous. The waiter who brought the menus could have (and should have) brought water.  Looking over the menu, the prices seemed to be excessive. The options were pretty limited, especially the sides. We didn't wait around to try the food."
3476,"I've been to the Juno Froyo Valley location a handful of times: From myself with two kiddos in tow to a group of three adults and four kids; from grandparents to tiny tots, Juno Froyo is sure to delight! Bright Colors, Incredibly Clean, Family-Friendly Music; Very Kind, Helpful Staff Ready to Greet You with a Genuine Smile. Then, there's the Delicious Froyo with Great Topping Choices; this place is a wonderful stop for grandparent's to spoil their grandkids, to use as a reward for kid's accomplishments, or to go as a special treat as a family outing. Seating can accommodate both small and large groups. Never so busy that a seat can't easily be found. Prices on the expensive side but well worth the splurge. Everyone leaves happy and satiated and that's all a mom could ask for❣️"
3477,Love their flights
3478,Amazing and friendly staff. My son had a blast!
3479,Never stayed there but ron said it was nice
3480,Went and visited this place today and I have to say that food was pretty bleh. My food was OK for what it was and my dad's tacos de lengua was bland and overcooked. The only positive remark I have to give this place among their kindness is their horchata was absolutely delicious. Not sure if I will be returning though
3481,"My half empty, mostly melted mcflurry was very disappointing."
3482,"Neat little bakery with about a thousand bakers/workers going in different directions to make one of the best chocolate chip cookies ever.  Nice selection of bake goods.  No donuts, but real good muffins, scones, croissant etc.  Becareful, because you could drive right by the place since it blends into the neighborhood."
3483,An old company that can't seem to get them the times. We have done it this way for years will be the down fall. I feel for the employees of this company. Bad management after bad management has brought this company to its knees.
3484,Good
3485,Any  light bulb or battery they will have it
3486,"Holy cow. The waffles are great but don't let the name fool you into thinking that's all they got. There's chicken, eggs, and just about anything you want. There are menu options galore, and the chef is incredibly allergy friendly. If you want something, they can make it happen. It's a quite and friendly local small business with a heck of a menu."
3487,I came into this coffee shop with a couple of kids and was treated poorly. The children were very well behaved but I was put out by how they treated me and truly the coffee was very expensive and all not all that special for the price.
3488,"Family owned, quality business, top of the line horse tack, western boots and clothing."
3489,"Always a wonderful experience there especially at Fletcher's.  First night ever staying g overnight was wonderful to, beautiful scenery of Anchorage Alaska."
3490,The food was great; the service receives 4 stars. Our table was dirty and the service was slow. I ordered the forest Mushroom Pizza and it was absolutely delicious. They have a wood fired oven and you can definitely tell by the quality of their pizza! My husband ordered the bistro ribs and also though they tasted great! They came with coleslaw and potatoes.
3491,"(Translated by Google) Great service

(Original)
Buen servicio"
3492,Anytime I need something that is hard to get this is my first stop & I normally get what I wan
3493,"I have been a State Farm Policy holder for some years now after leaving Allstate and I am very impressed with Justin Goodman's great service. He reminders me of the good ole days when people in business really looked out for the welfare of their clients. Again, thank you Justin!
My wife and I are very pleased with the service you have provided for us.

Dale"
3494,"Good food, very generous portions."
3495,There sellin ice cream pizzas now...
3496,It’s always good.BRING CASH
3497,"We eat here quite often. I usually always get the Eggs Benedict. We haven’t had any complaints, except one, which they generously compensated for. Great service always, great food always. We’ll always go back!!"
3498,I brought my kitten their turns out she is a he lol but excellent work wait time is causal
3499,The DiRoma sauce and stuffed shrimp is delicious.
3500,Great service they even texted the next day to make sure my truck was running good!
3501,Good craft store. Smaller of the two in town. I buy a lot of yarn and fabric from Joann.
3502,It was great food and great service
3503,"(Translated by Google) It's a bit of a factory, we do not have much time to play with the puppies, and when the show is over, we are urged to go back in the shuttles to return to the hotel. The shuttle driver speaks, but ours was incomprehensible, and the show is presented at a very fast pace, hardly we had time to see the books or the photographs proposed to the purchase .... it was necessary to release the places

(Original)
C'est un peu l'usine, on ne nous laisse pas beaucoup de temps pour jouer avec les chiots, et quand le show est fini, on nous presse de remonter dans les navettes pour retourner à l'hôtel. Le chauffeur de navette parle, mais le nôtre était incompréhensible, et le show est présenté à un rythme très soutenu, à peine on a eu le temps de voir les livres ou les photos proposés à l'achat....il fallait libérer les lieux"
3504,"Ordered the meatloaf dinner it was supposed to be bacon wrapped, sounded great on the menu, when it arrived it looked like it had been reheated, and it had bacon sprinkled on the top.
Friend chicken was dry. And pretty pricey."
3505,I love this place. Good food and very nice employees
3506,Nice shop and showroom but the staff are not so friendly.
3507,"This is my favorite Target in Anchorage. It's right outside of one of JBER's gates and in a shopping plaza that has everything (Sam's Club, IHOP, the movie theater, Kohls... You name it you got it!). Anyway, service is Target-standard. They have Alaska souvenirs and all the good stuff. It works for what you need- a Target fix!"
3508,Fun...went but had no desire to go and I'm glad I did.  It changed my view of it.  I had a good time.
3509,It was successful
3510,Very good food and the early afternoon staff was excellent and helpful
3511,Great Bulgogi and Ghalbe delicious
3512,"Great coffee,  good food"
3513,"Just ate here after searching for a good Pho place. Fast, very friendly, and the food was excellent.  Nice and clean, so glad we found this spot!"
3514,It was a great experience with patience on the store and my part
3515,Gci is awesome the people that work for gci tend to be rude
3516,Fantastic staff and delicious food
3517,The cubano wad super delicious and I really enjoyed the chicken ceasar salad!!
3518,Coffee from here is always the best!
3519,"First time was great, second time got my steak cooked wrong twice"
3520,My go to guys they've done great work on both of my vehicles
3521,Lots of store options
3522,Got what my Husband needed
3523,"The coffee, and my shots are never burnt! My favorite one is the mocha!"
3524,Fun place to play pool and grab a drink with friends
3525,Pizza is very good
3526,Great spot to hike. Very easy with a view of Anchorage.
3527,"Havent had diahrreah in a while? Well, look no further. Taco bell will clean out anything you may be holding on to. Go for the grande meal."
3528,"Really good pizza, decent prices for the area. Our server seemed a bit exasperated, but service was good nonetheless."
3529,Great little one stop shop and gas
3530,"This place is always busy and messy.  The restrooms are never maintained and the stick of items in the store are always low.  However, it is a necessary stop to get some gas and stretch your legs from the long drive.  Since there is no competition near by they have no reason to improve."
3531,Little slow and there was nobody there.
3532,Thorough cleaning
3533,"This place was awesome I needed an alignment before I had to put my truck away in storage and they got me right in, helped me figure out what the issue was offered several diffrent options to fix it and got me in and out in a couple hours, would definitely recommend this place, I will be bringing both my trucks to them being we just moved to wasilla and were looking for a reliable shop"
3534,Great beer and food. Matanuska Brewery does a great job with their beers! Well worth a visit!
3535,The Staff here is awesome! Always friendly and helpful!
3536,"Good shopping complex - Best Buy, Target, Regal 16, many more.  A little too spaced out and hard to walk from one place to another but sometimes necessary due to parking."
3537,"Great place to have a few drinks , visit with friends and just relax ."
3538,"The coffee is always good, not hit and miss like most places are. The people are nice, cheerful."
3539,Could use more parking but otherwise very nice!
3540,Lots of food! I ate the prime rib dinner! Waitress was smiling and friendly.
3541,We like a dat coffee shop .cool place to people watch while your downtown
3542,Lady kept asking me if that was it after each item......why...I've seem memes of this.....big nope
3543,Frazils
3544,"Well, its McDonald's. Decent food, I love the chicken club sandwich, plus you can buy 13 cookies for 4 bucks so that's really nice for you and your group of friends."
3545,Variety of items
3546,Comfort
3547,Same thing every time
3548,"This is the best Costco, the parking is easier than the southside one and it has more selection"
3549,"The pub has board games for your children to enjoy, coloring, and friendly family environment. If you want to play pool or darts, have some adult beverages and watch the game... This place is also great for that!"
3550,What more could you want?
3551,Everything they make here is pretty amazing I love there pizza and so do my children also my kids love it here for playing games it has a great view of the spit great place !
3552,"I will never order anything from them ever again. I received food that was burnt, something that resembled meat, and after calling and emailing them I have yet to be able to speak to a manager. Sometimes things happen, I get it. Providing great Customer service is how you make things right when they do go wrong and not acknowledging customer's complaints only makes things worst. I refuse to invest anymore energy into this I just won't patronize Sicily's again. Shame on you!!!!"
3553,Helpful in time of need
3554,"Great food, make sure you are hungry if you order the full size, it's probably equivalent to 3- 6"" subway ssndeiches"
3555,Really good food. Really good beer. I'd highly recommend the reindeer beer cheese soup.
3556,Pete is a great guy! Super attentive staff!
3557,Service
3558,"Wonderful place with great ambience, friendly and knowledgeable staff. The building has a lot of cool local history. Coffee was excellent and they have food and alcohol as well. There is also a little boutique inside that has cool local gifts and art. Nice sitting area in the front to people watch and a large room in the back with comply seating."
3559,"OK everybody their food has went to the dumpster. I was just in there for lunch, nobody else in the restaurant and it still took over 50 minutes to get two rolls out, and they were the wrong ones! they are under new management I wouldn’t recommend this place again to anybody. The waitress kept complaining about being new and no one in restaurant knew the foods on the menu. Can’t believe I wasted an hour for food that was so wrong it was sad, and also inedible."
3560,Friendliest customer service experience at McDonald's in a LONG time. Friendly smile and food was fresh and HOT like it should be. ☺
3561,Best place for Christmas shopping!
3562,The employees here have always been happy and helpful!
3563,"If u are looking for a relaxed experience with family or friends this is the place! I always love whatever I eat here, the artwork is so fun, it's always clean, and the servers always take care of our party. It's somewhat expensive but any restaurant in Alaska with good food usually is."
3564,Every dish is delicious and authentic. One of my fairbanks favorites!
3565,"Some people wanted to leave early, so we didn't get to spend the whole time there that we paid for. The northern lights were awesome!"
3566,We have regularly ordered from them for delivery.  We always get our food in a reasonable time frame.  It's always hot and very very delicious. Have always been very happy with the customer service of both the person answering the phone and especially from their delivery driver.  I've recommended them to everyone I know for their egg rolls too.  Great place to get delivery from!
3567,Enjoyed the sights and adventure there . Almost got run over by a moose scurrying by . Big male ... Do not want to be in his way . The history of this place is very interesting . Make certain you read or see the history of Earthquake Park .
3568,Wonderful massage!!  Thank you
3569,"Usually crowded and food that tastes like it was made on an assembly line. If you are looking for a good meal, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a quick meal, there are many other superior options."
3570,"This is not a real steakhouse. When sitting down. To order, we asked about how good their steak was, and the answer we got was "" we have a brand new cook, so it should be ok "" we then ordered cheeseburgers."
3571,"I thought I had torn a muscle in my shoulder, but it wasn't healing. So, I had Dr. Smith take a look at it. It turned out the shoulder joint was out of place. 3 days later my shoulder feels great again, after a month and a half of pain. I should have seen him much sooner."
3572,Well maintained clean groomed trail. Could use a few more places to stop and rest but an easy going trail. Dog friendly.
3573,"It is a good place to get fresh, fast,and good food. I highly recommend it to anyone."
3574,Good stop for lunch if in Healy.
3575,"Wendy's was packed the day I went inside to grab a sandwich. McDonalds is closed for renovations so that's my guess why. It was slow getting my food only because of how packed it was. On the plus side, food was hot!"
3576,Really great burger with garlic fries. Will be ordering from them again in the future.
3577,I always love the museum. Alaskan history is rich and plentiful. Never a bad choice to go and learn about Alaska.
3578,"The manager named ""Ross"" kicked me out and not to return for his mess up twice in a week with us. First time we had to wait for our order because he didn't know what was up. Threw our order out. Served people who came in after us. Just because I told him we only returned because of the other nice manger who he works with"
3579,4 stars for being different and new
3580,Gorgeous
3581,Terrible entertainment
3582,Kinda dirty
3583,"This place is so fun, we spent 8 hrs there!"
3584,Big spaces wide open.
3585,"Crowded, but everyone was wearing masks.  No one was social distancing."
3586,"Way too spendy for the quality of the food, service is spotty.  It is a beautiful spot and the remodel is beautiful, but really wish someone could figure out the whole thing."
3587,"Loved this place, potentially my fave in Fairbanks. Very nice servers and great beers. Enjoyed hanging in the courtyard."
3588,Good service and good food!  The drivethru is quick and accurate.
3589,"To start this Im only giving you 1 star because its the only way to review. I went there today and went to drive-thru and everything went well until we had to wait in pull up for food. Everything came out to us pretty fast except for the bbq sauce I ordered I got out of my car and went in to get it so that not to bad except if I had wanted to walk in I wouldnt have went thru drivethru. We got foid checked bags and all food there so drove home, which is all the way past OMally because I wont go to Dimond McDonalds because food and order us always messed up, always go to Huffman. Well I got 3 grandchildren home with food- started eating and 2 of our cheeseburgers had no meat on them...2 cheesebuger really. So got children and myself back in car and drive all way back to McDonalds to tell them about this problem and the Manager acted like this wasn't even a problem. He said he was sorry and made us 2 new cheeseburgers and then walked away. I cant belive he didnt even give me my money back for those 2 cheeseburgers for our in convienence. I will be calling his boss and will do the survey on my reciept. Im really shocked he didnt give grandchildren a ice cream cone or a pie. I dont think we will be going back there again."
3590,"A Fairbanks great local place! It's proof that if you do one thing and do it well, you will be a success. Always fresh, and they have local veggies in the summer! The people are always friendly and the owners go above and beyond to make customers happy. There isn't anything on the menu I wouldn't recommend, but my personal favorite is a half e² 😊"
3591,"We had so fun here ,  I can't say any negative. Staff, awesome. Service awesome.  Food, spectacular"
3592,Very interesting and friendly staff
3593,Busy and worth the wait!!
3594,It's your typical Kohl's. Nothing more nothing less.
3595,"Gracious, bold ..... Accommodating to truth and righteousness."
3596,Delicious combination of diner fare and small town chic
3597,Drink was not all that great
3598,Love Costco.
3599,Yum!
3600,Amazing flavors!
3601,"Same dishes. Mostly delicious. Nothing under or over cooked, mongolian bowls are a plus. Wish there was more selection."
3602,My most recent complaint is we were seat for lunch and no one had some to talk or get our drink order for 15 minutes. A waitress walked by slammed 1 water at the the end of our table eventhough there were 2 of us and talked away. We thought maybe she's be back with another and waited a few more minutes. Nothing. We got up and left.
3603,"I have never felt compelled to give a restaurant review,  but after eating at Burger Jim tonight I feel I must.   Tonight our family of five decided to give them a try.   We thought we would all order a different burger to give them a really good test.   And to extend our trial further we even ordered an order  Mongolian Beef,  house fries, and regular fries for everyone to sample  OMG!!  We all agreed that everything we purchased was the best we had ever had!  We are sorry that we have waited so long to give this place a try.  It is for sure our new favorite for burgers, fries, and Chinese food.   Someone said in one of the reviews that they dream about the House Fries.....I have no doubt I will be too!  Do yourselves a favor and don't wait as long as we did to eat at Burger Jim!"
3604,Wow foods
3605,Food for hungry
3606,A truly wonderful experience. Great service and the halibut was to die for. I would definitely visit this restaurant again!
3607,"Went to a birthday party upstairs. Good food, good service, and a great place for a party."
3608,Good hang out
3609,"Consistently well made food, been coming here for years and have always loved their food. I genuinely believe this is one of the best restaurants in Anchorage."
3610,No wait.
3611,Okay
3612,Great park!
3613,"Great food and our Server ""Star"" was truly a STAR!"
3614,I mostly went in the evening. The always have friendly staff.

3616,"Went for burger night on Wednesday. Food was great. We'll constructed burgers, wife had mushroom burger and it was very good. I had the spicy veggie burger  (qauliflower and quinoa)  that was the second best veggie burger I ever had. The reason for the 4 instead of five star, I ordered a gluten free bun and they had run out. They open @ 5, I ordered by 6:20 you can't run out of that so quick. P.S. best veggie burger is @ the skirted heifer in Fort Collins Co."
3617,"The ice cream here is always delicious and homemade! Flavors rotate frequently and they serve your ice cream quickly, even in a rush."
3618,"Awesome RV park on the spit, about 3 and 1/2 miles out.   Now, its a bit more pricey than other places on the spit, but the reason is you get what you pay for.  They have a private beach that is for the RV park guests.  The shower and restroom facilities are included with the cost, and they're the cleanest facilities of any RV park I've ever ever been to (all across the states).  There are two gas grills so you can cook outside,, and areas to sit out in the open or under their covered area..  Laundry facilities are available, of course, clean and tidy, but for a load to wash and dry is about $5.  They have a cafe and serve coffee and other items.  And of course there's a  gift shop.  Its right next to the fishing hole as well.  The sites themselves ha e water, sewer, and 20/30/50 amp service.  Each site has a fire pit and picnic table.  Its awesome.  You can fish, have a fire, and watch the bald eagles come and hang out.  And the people running and working here are super friendly.  There's also an observation deck on the second floor, just so you can enjoy the views of Kachemak Bay.  From now on when I come to Homer, I'll be staying here."
3619,"Uniquely themed Alaska original artwork. Quality Hoodies and T's and handful of other craft products and stickers. Also 1 of 2 ""Onewheel"" dealers in town.  Great place."
3620,"Really neat little shop for good yarn, women's & children's boutique clothing and super cute home goods!"
3621,Love the animals! They're expanding a little to include more animals so stay tuned!!
3622,Amazing food and amazing service.
3623,Food is tasty nice portion and selection hally with variety of beer please add boulivard brewery one day to the taps.
3624,Always the BEST!! Food and Staff really make the day.
3625,I always go to Carr's they are really good with WIC and getting it rang out
3626,"Am a Thai food lover and this is by far the best I have had from Anchorage to San Francisco, and spots in between.  Their new location next door to their Yogurt shop is really nice!  So clean and bright.  Still great food, FRESH, reasonably priced, good wait staff, owner friendly.  A family fun operation that has grown from a couple of tables in a Mom & Pop convenience store, to a dedicated restaurant over the last 25 years.  LOVE IT!  Very busy place."
3627,Great spot for sunny days
3628,They're really hit or miss on customer service. Today way a good experience.
3629,the movie on the Aurora is a must see.
3630,Good pizza and good beer on tap.
3631,Food was okay do not like the coleslaw and the staff seems to just hang out and talk with a group of people at different table. Overall okay please
3632,If you like being treated like a criminal shop here. I made a quick stop here while waiting on a layover at the airport. We just ran in for a pair of shoes and snacks for the kids. We were stopped 6 times by varies people telling my mother that she needed to not have her purse in the store! What the heck?!  It wasn't a large purse. And 6 people!? Craziness. What was supposed to be a quick run in and run out was delayed by all the stupidity.
3633,"The husband and wife that own this store are wonderful, extremely knowledgeable, and willing to go the extra mile. Would recommend without hesitation!"
3634,It's costco
3635,"Views are great. Campground is well maintained. Lots of spots under the trees or in the clear. They have porta potties, a dumpster and trash can on sight and a potable water spicket across the street. Great experience staying."

3645,Friendly employees
3646,They are ok.

3650,Nice people gave me a deal on some pen carts.
3651,They always help out in a time of beed
3652,"Fantastic sea food and plenty of local beer on tap.

Get there as soon as it opens, it fills up quick as it is popular with tourists and locals alike."
3653,I love this place!
3654,Good plant burger and tater tots are super yummy and you get a good portion size for all your food! The brookie dessert was the best!!!
3655,Outstanding
3656,We really enjoy the Chicken!  A bit expensive though.
3657,"Nice, perfect to get out big towns. Peace and silence, cleaned places..and big mountains to see..and admired the the hard working people in the cold weather."
3658,The staff here is always friendly and courteous. The produce section always looks amazing. The bakery section also always looks great and the donut cabinet always makes me break my diet. It has a Starbuck's inside and the grocery store as a whole is a good place to pick up what you need. Prices are a little higher than the Fred's which is right down the street though. The building it's in is a little older and it shows once you are outside the Carr's. I gave it a four because there is usually a bit of a wait when trying to check out.
3659,Service is always good and the food is great
3660,The people always think you're conning them. Renting from these people is rough.
3661,"Decent flavors but way too expensive, especially with respect to portion size.  Poor value."

3668,"Great, super, super fast, super good, super staff!!!"
3669,I just cant get enough of this place. Glad there is one on the east side
3670,"This is one of the must place in Anchorage area.  Enjoyed to observe wildlife in such a close distance.   I recognized the real size of those animals.  It was dusty area as roads are not well maintained, so prepare for such condition."
3671,"They have the best salads and sweets in town! The staff is always super friendly, and they were super accommodating and efficient with my delivery orders. This business is fantastic!"
3672,"Excellent experience all the way around. Great Service,  and it was the best sub I've ever had. 5 stars!!"

3678,Not to good
3679,If you want a taste of Tokyo order a dish from reharu Japanese cuisine on dimond boulevard in Anchorage Alaska. I ordered the vegetable fried rice with teriyaki chicken and it was delicious. The staff was friendly and the delivery was quick. I give them a five star.
3680,"Friendly, but need more economical choices, like trim."
3681,Very good food and good price. Highly recommend
3682,A good place to get groceries or take a break at.
3683,Need a lot of help. Never enough registers open while stay stand around prices going up not the place anymore
3684,Dounuts r definitely delicious and the coffee is great.
3685,"Really good pizza, good service, would be nice if I could add tomatoes. I understand when you're busy but we were the only ones in there."
3686,Literally right down the street from me How can you being that this that I love their read bull smoothies  that's the one with the tie dye in it😘 Theres not  always a wait  always courteous although it is hard not to hit their coffee stand due to their small driveways you have to maneuver a bit but totally worth it♡♡
3687,Good food and fast service.
3688,The nicest yogurt place in Anchorage that we've been to.
3689,"Went shopping for my sweeties birthday card and some presents. The nice lady working there helped me look at all sorts of jewelry pieces, even trying some on, until I picked the perfect gifts."

3697,Good chill sandwhich
3698,"Was in search of a last minute, late night purchase and found this place. Great selection and really nice sales ladies. The exterior is a little.... shady. Other then that, was a good experience."
3699,"We love to eat here. Its crowded on Tuesday,  which is dollar rib night. We just took a bar table and enjoyed our Bacon Cheese burger and Cowboy Sundae. The Cowboy sundae is choice of meat layered with baked beans and coleslaw."
3700,"So. Much. Fun.

We had a great time with our 2-year-old"
3701,"Nice campground and close to the lake.  They need to do some road maintenance though.  Otherwise, this is a good place to stay if you are on your way to Denali Park."
3702,He always does an amazing job and quickly!
3703,Great place working hard on my car
3704,Its normal wendy's. I ordered two kids meals and only one got a toy.
3705,"I had a wonderful meal here.  It's a small place, which makes it feel homey.  Excellent service, too."
3706,Sure
3707,Got my second gun from here for only 200 bucks so excited ❤❤
3708,Just beautiful.
3709,Love their chicken wish they had more dipping sauces
3710,Nothing is going to prepare you for what you're about to see...
3711,Plenty of lanes open during busy hours.  Large layout though.  Bring a map.
3712,Extremely knowledgeable and friendly people. Fair prices especially for a locally owned store. I'm always stopping by to see their selection
3713,cheap stuff
3714,Old but quaint hotel.  Close to downtown. Flowers are gorgeous
3715,Monopoly Time! Always great selection and customer service
3716,Spa services here are euphoric! I highly recommend!
3717,Very clean place. You might hear a little noise outside due to the mall but nothing  after it closes. I wish they have had eggs with no cheese and milk ( I asked) my baby is allergic. Otherwise food was Excellent in general. Close to everything!
3718,"Best place to shop for good clothing, they just need a little more inventory."
3719,"I'll never go back. This place has the worst humans I have ever had the misfortune of having to speak to answering the phone. Their rude, they don't listen to what you say, eating and talking to other people while you are speaking and when you try to get them to do anything they snap at you like a bratty school kid. The doctor is amazing, she needs to do something about her abhorious clerical staff. Employ someone that appreciates having a job, not angry that they have things they need to do. 1 star for a having a  doctor that discusses the issues and listenes. No stars for anything else."
3720,"First off, I have to state that Alaska requires the use of a curve for rating certain things, like the service industry.  By my usual Lower 48 standards, this place may be a 2.5-3 (for the main rooms--not the cabins).  If you know Tok and what it has to offer in this regard, then one may lean a little higher.  They work with you if you have to arrive after hours, are dog-friendly, have a nice little restaurant on site and a bunch of nice folks.  The rooms I've stayed in could use some work, but by Alaska standards, they are still doing pretty good.  And the price is surprisingly better than a lot of places (at least in the winter months).  They have a pretty decent salad bar too.  If you ever spend any time in Alaska, you will know why this is a benchmark of a good place that serves food.
If you're making a stop for the night in this area, I'd make it here."
3721,Normal Walmart but we got all food needed our Denali expedition. McDonalds with Denali burger inside of centre.

3727,Server name Jenny was amazing would only have her serve for me from now on.
3728,Their coffee is amazing. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. Their apple cider in the fall is also the best.
3729,It's the only one in the area but still has great customer service. The food is exactly what you expect from GC.
3730,"Seen a few Eagles, a Northern Harrier and a hen Mallard here today."
3731,Shazam! Best movie ever
3732,"Sooo good the chicken by itself is alil on the bland side but once you get that caines dipping sauce on them, boy does that chicken sing! The sweet tea is perfect to! Like true southern sweet tea has enough sugar to almost make you pucker!"
3733,They had everything but one item I needed and the customer service was nice
3734,"Love this place! Great mix of natural gemstones, glass, pearls, crystals &  seed beads and an outstanding collection of pendants and charms!"

3740,Super great staff. Packed our sandwiches up special for our fishing trip the next day. Really good sandwiches too!
3741,This is a great place to eat. The staff is always pleasant. The food is great with very healthy portions. One of my favorite places in Wasilla
3742,It has great soup and services. But lately they are down for their selections.
3743,Very great place
3744,"Loving the new items they get every time I go in, which isn't very often. The prices and help with getting some help cud use a little work. Other than that, great people, very helpful."

3756,Tasty halibut at the roof top bar. Nice.
3757,Saw nothing but gulls and salmon. The article I read said this was the area for finding shore birds. Not so!
3758,Good service
3759,Good dinner food
3760,"Food was good, but it was crowded and very noisy."
3761,Educational for all ages. Outside fish ladder is exciting when the salmon are running. They have some native fish on display and touch tanks. Good place for young kids (toddler / preschool) on a rainy day.
3762,Yummy food!
3763,This place has stunning food. It doesn't get perfect marks because I've been served burnt pizza and really average poutine. It's really difficult to get a reservation and the staff has been rude to me more then once when trying to get a table. They never told me I could sit in the bar area without a reservation and even tried to keep me from doing so. I had to insist that I knew it was possible. I believe I was treated badly because they didn't realize I was a local.
3764,"Great waiter, food was okay, price was a little high."
3765,Very nice sports complex.  The seats were comfortable.  The only thing that we didn't care for was the exceedingly over priced food and drink.
3766,"Highly qualified and professional doctors, specialists and staff. I have been a patient here on and off for years  but recently I've been working with Dr. Lorenz since 2015.  I have a relatively complicated situation, and have had experienced a lot of discrimination and negative bedside manner when doctors could not diagnose the problem.  I've only had positive experiences with this organization.  Dr. Lorenz has taken great care to determine the best course of action, if any is necessary, and is great at ensuring that the patient understands the information that is necessary for their health. The only drawback, if you feel the need for one, is that the location is in a medical office area on the north edge of downtown where most people don't travel to very often.  Access to the area is great, and there is plenty of parking on street, adjacent to the building if the parking lot is ever full.   And sometimes you have to wait a month out for an appointment.  If you need a specialist, I'd surely recommend these folks first."
3767,"Plenty of parking, plus a little shop so you can buy snacks and drinks and bear spray before heading off on your Denali adventure."
3768,"They have a fair selection of sporting goods specific to SE Alaska's unique requirements but the customer service is typically poor. The tools are all terrible quality, Chinese junk. The building is rarely maintained with buckets catching roof leaks all over the place. I wish I could take the sporting goods over to Sportsman's Warehouse and have a clean, frindly, well stocked store."
3769,"Beautiful gallery space and TONS of amazing artwork. You can find original artworks, prints, stickers, jewelry, clothing/ custom painted hats, and more! A great selection of local talent and artists on display with good vibes and friendly staff."
3770,Never got to a human. Still not resolved.

3774,"Delightful restaurant, quiet atmosphere just a few blocks from the larger bustling restaurants.  Food is priced right for the region."
3775,"Rating the parts department only. Everytime I stop in to pick up parts there is never a place to park.  The lot is filled up with long term cars, for the service department I would assume, and no where for parts customers to park.  At all!  Once inside, I can count on one over tasked parts guy helping a retail customers find a trim clip or other small part while I wait for as long as 20 minutes to pick up a paid for wholesale part worth hundreds.  You guys need to rethink your parts counter.  Worst in town for wholesale."
3776,Pizza ingredient was substituted when they ran out without first advising us and asking if we would still want the pizza.
3777,Medical  Clinics and private condos
3778,"I have NO doubt this place will be a 5 star establishment soon. The food is over the top delicious, but they are still working out some kinds. I have zero complaints about the attitude of the wait staff, but I do have to drop a star for how they generally don't greet you until you're seated and they kinda notice you are there. There aren't a lot of tables. C'mon. No one even greets you with a ""be right with you"" or anything to let you know you're valued. Once you've gotten a menu and ordered, it is all made from scratch essentially, so I understand it takes a bit... but if we could get that arrival part worked out, things would move just a little faster."
3779,Not my favorite location. The people aren't as friendly as other locations & there's always a excessively long wait in the drive-in.
3780,Great!  Loved it!
3781,Nice staff.
3782,"LOWE'S IS ALWAYS GOOD TIME 😁
THEY ARE UNDERSTAFFED BUT THEY'RE GETTING READY FOR SPRING AND GARDENING 😁🌞"
3783,"We stop here all the time when going up and down the Seward Hwy. I like the big slice, which is 1/4 of a pie.  It can get swamped with folks on the go, but they do a good job keeping up with it.  I also like I can pull in the back with the trailer on the truck. Pizza is good, prices are pretty fair and they have a lot of outdoor seating when it gets busy."
3784,"We moved in as the house we were living in sold and we were in dire straights with a baby in tote. Our first 2 weeks there we were boiling water to bathe the baby as we had hot water. It took them 2 weeks to repair because they flipped a switch and it turned out we needed a whole new water heater. We had a water leak that took 2 months for them to address, we had water leaking thru our kitchen light and cupboards and they came and just put a piece of sheetrock over the hole and plastered it. We spring a leak over the showerhead and were afraid as the sheetrock leaked it would fall on my Grandson while he bathed. Our got water was hooked up to the toilet and raised our electric, our garbage disposal quit working, we had to wash clothes by hand waiting for repairs and then the dryer quit working and the dishwasher was leaky.. we had mold under the sink and the kitchen drawers had no sliders and the fireplace was broken with sharp edges. If we had proper notice of the house selling we would have NEVER made the mistake of paying for substandard living quarters."
3785,Good Mexican food is hard to come by in Anchorage. This place has food flavor and is quick enough for a lunch stop. Coworkers and I frequent this place.
3786,Good service
3787,Incredible place
3788,Rented for a week. I rented too small but personnel were efficient and courteous.
3789,"This place was not bad and not great we were in Juneau port for one day and we had a half day excision and since this tram was right by the port we figured we would give it a  a shot.
PROS: close to port, hiking trails we not bad, great views of local landscape and port. Also it is locally run and we would rather pay the locals then give more to the cruise line.

CONS: too expensive for what is offered on t hw top, the eagle was in a small enclousure and we felt bad for him,  it took over 1.5hrs to get down because of a long line and they crammed in so many people on the tram you could barely breath.  Some hiking trails were closed and we were not told until we got to the top.  Food was not great and expensive."
3790,I love the food here!
3791,"For on the go stay , this place is open!"
3792,Nice walk.
3793,Excellent food and excellent service
3794,Lots of variety. ALWAYS FRESH
3795,"(Translated by Google) There is no exposure to the view. Had a great luck with the weather. The parking lot was virtually empty and the viewing platform also, because the signs to the viewpoints, or to the exits or parking spaces towards Denali National Park do not exist. Sometimes there is a hint now, which is often too late.
Well it's definitely worth stopping there.

(Original)
Da ist nicht auszusetzen bei der Aussicht. Hatten selbst ein riesen Glück mit dem Wetter. Der Parkplatz war quasi leer und die Aussichtsplattform auch, denn die Ausschilderungen zu den Aussichtspunkten, beziehungsweise zu den Ausfahrten oder Parkplätzen Richtung Denali Nationalpark existieren garnicht. Bzw aufeinmal gibt es einen Hinweis jetzt abbiegen, was oft zu spät ist.
Na ja es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall da anzuhalten."
3796,"If you're looking for good Italian food with family size portions and on the cheap. Look no further! Guido's is one of those hidden gems that you hear of or shall I say ""you don't hear about"". While the decor and atmosphere leaves you with a sense of a ghost town, the food will more than make up for it. Many times have I ordered from them only to get filled up on their Greek salad and I still had a hot sandwich left untouched. I have been a long time customer of Guido's and plan to be for many more years."
3797,"Absolutely amazing place.

Great customer service"
3798,Grocery store with a spectacular view of the Mendenhall Glacier
3799,"The Sand Bar is pretty much a run down heap of a building.  With that said it is one if those places people love to visit because it is ""real"".  People just want to come, eat, drink and have a good time with their friends and buddies.  There are pool tables and Karoke.  The grill serves some of the best fried halibut you will eat.  They also have prime rib, burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Fries are home made.  Prices for most sandwiches are 9-12 dollars.  Halibut is 18 or 21 depending on how big you go.  21 is 1/2 pound or eight 1 oz pieces.  The other is 5 oz.  I come here everytime I visit Juneau.  When they are busy, especially during extended lunch time (11-2:30) or so don't expect to come in for a quick bite.  It is all made fresh and it takes a bit to prepare it.  You WILL like it though."

3824,"Always a fun shopping experience in Juneau. The shop is clean, bright, friendly. Nice selection of jewelry, candles, gourmet treats, soap, toys, socks, gifts, cards, etc. They seem to rotate stock a lot too, as every time I go in, there are new items. Best part is they are open year round! Stop by on a gloomy winter day and it will be sure to brighten your spirits."
3825,Great staff and products!
3826,It's like a store in the Soviet Union the shelfs are half empty and they never have the same thing twice.
3827,"All teens work there,all smiles"
3828,Anchorage classic!

3830,Great place to go for chicken
3831,"Fun, informative and interesting!"
3832,Pricey but always great to go in and chat with the people here. As a fan of old computers I always check here first for anything I need.
3833,Wedding was successful
3834,"For someone who doesn't go for that type of food, they found a dish that I really enjoyed."
3835,"Good place to stay in Fairbanks, pretty close to the city center. However, pretty crowded and a little bit run down."
3836,Cathy is the best! We love her and always enjoy seeing her.
3837,"Great hardware store, helpful employees, reasonable prices."
3838,The Best food.
3839,Love it pricey but worth it sometimes
3840,"I have shopped at this commissary for 15 years. The selection is limited and I blame that on DECA not the staff. Produce is hit or miss, but get what you need for a few days and its alright.I do believe it was open on Mondays considering we are 10 miles from Safeway which is high priced.
Cashiers and baggers are great. Deli section always serves with a smile, but selection of me at a is lacking. Sandwiches are great especially the grilled wraps. Don't shop on military paydays if you are like me and hate crowds."
3841,"I fund what I was looking for, and good price."
3842,Good food. Good coffee
3843,Love the owner and staff. We come see them every year!
3844,Best place to go for your pet needs.
3845,Nice little store with a welcoming vibe. Nice staff. Good buds.
3846,Good drinks. Played pool and listened to the jukebox
3847,"We met two friends there for Taco Tuesday after work. When we arrived we told the host that we were meeting our friends and they insisted they were not there yet and directed us to the bar, I asked if we could look around and the host insisted our friends hadn’t arrived, eventually letting us look for them. Not sure why they didn’t want us to look around, but our friends had already been seated and served. They had let the host know that they were waiting for two more... we were the two more. Pretty sure the host was judging us based on the color of our skin. We are white, our friends are not. We haven’t been back because of this combined with the flavorless food and mediocre drinks. We laugh about it now, but it was crazy to us at the time."
3848,Came to my Truck Within 1 hour of calling. Replaced the windshield within 2 hours.
3849,Ok good place to shop
3850,"Best seafood I've ever had. Anchorage offers surprisingly high quality seafood at a very reasonable price (partly because there's no tax) And I'm comparing to cities with strong seafood culture like Boston, Seattle, and Honolulu.
Despite the very good dining experience we've had at this place, I couldn't give it five stars because their steaks are always overcooked and cooked unevenly. You have to ask for one or two levels lower to get the doneness you want (e.g. their 'medium' is actually medium-well or even close to well-done). I really hope they address this issue because it's a waste of the high quality beef they use. Nobody wants dry aged Prime grade steak well-done!"
3851,"The GM is awesome! I had an issue with a purchase and the employee at the service desk. I sent a message on the Target website. The GM contacted me the next day and took care of everything. Great deals, great products, the best prices around! They price match too, to tons of competitors, unlike Walmart. It's always clean. I highly recommend this store! I'd work here if I lived closer."
3852,"The lake has a nice view, with ice, can see far away the glacier."
3853,The secret room is what's fun!
3854,"Comfy recliners, quarter-pound hot dog and a soda. Great screen and sound system. Gotta love the matinee prices!"
3855,I like the manager at the store I go to. She is very knowledgeable and always has a smile on.
3856,The chicken fried steak is amazing and lunches are very good as well
3857,Food was well  done and out fast. Enjoyed night staff. Only issue burgers were smaller then buns and no one at door to show me to a place to sit. Hours are hard when i work late and you were to be open till 12
3858,"Picked this place because it is conveniently located near my home. I usually do the wash yourself, but didn't feel like it today, so chose a touchless wash. There was a bit of a wait (about 20 minutes) and didn't get all the bird poop off of the car, but the car is clean and only cost $10. The $10 wash is pretty basic, but not too bad. I'll probably shop around for another car wash next time or go back to my old standby."
3859,Beauty
3860,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! DONT EVEN DSEVER A STAR!!!
3861,Awesome!! Pizza has nice crust (not too thick but not cardboard thin either). I had the Greek style which was really good. Beer selection is nice and atmosphere is casual but still really nice. Service was great.
3862,"Checkin, to staff and doctor all a really good experience!!"
3863,"Kaladi Brothers is consistently fantastic. The coffee is fresh and typically complex. They serve the best Americano in town that I know of.  The Brayton location has a phenomenal crew of baristas behind the bar.  They are pleasant to interact with, and they work like a well-oiled machine to get some great coffee out fast."
3864,Great salmon and good prices
3865,"The food is always fresh and good. While the food isn't inexpensive, it's about the cost you'd expect to pay to get food in a mall that's downtown.

I'll totally be coming back here to eat."
3866,Really great food and serivse.
3867,I go here all the time with the boys after a good workout. I grab the globe burrito because it has 4 different meats so it's protein packed.
3868,Awesome products I can't find anywhere else and I love the people who work there!
3869,Love this Place!!! Awesome Service and Awesome Food!!!!!
3870,Expensive
3871,Get better
3872,"While I am pleased with customer service at Alaska Airlines both local and when I have had to call the 800 number I am thoroughly discouraged with the ""flow"" and layout of our Kodiak terminal. The terminal is smaller and arriving passengers must ""cut"" thru passengers waiting to get ticketed or checked in pre flight to retrieve baggage. Stressful for all. I dont see how this was at all an improvement!
Come on Alaska Airlines."
3873,Loved the Egyptian Tomb room! Awesome effects and interesting puzzles. Looking forward to Noir when that opens.
3874,Excellent customer service!
3875,"Our room was cozy, views are excellent, staff super friendly and helpful."
3876,Rental car had inadequate tires for Anchorage Alaska.  got stuck in Walmart parking lot. Had to call AAA to pull me out of parking spot.
3877,"It's a Walmart. Just like every other Walmart. On the plus side, they let RVers Park here."
3878,Great
3879,Its okay not much of anything to shop through but all the employees are nice and helpful
3880,Nice seats helpful staff solved a problem for me.
3881,Fast and Good Food .Sorry your closed!
3882,Moving to a new location. Everything was 60% to 20% off..
3883,"My wife and I stayed at the Historic Anchorage Hotel and booked their ""Romance"" package. The package was to include a Jr Suite, a bottle champagne, a round trip carriage ride to Orsos restaurant with $60 coupon.

Checking into the Hotel we were given actual keys. We thought it was all part of the historic charm but still thought it odd. When we finally was able to get to our room and my wife had a very difficult time turning the key to open the door. Once we were able to unlock the door I had to shoulder open the door because it was stuck in the frame.
The room was spacious and had a decent view but it was very cold and i was unable to find a thermostat or a heater. Also found that the deadbolt on the door was not working properly and we could not safely secure the door overnight. We went downstairs to report the door and heat issue. To the front desk's credit (I think her name was Jennifer) she immediately changed the room for us and joined us to verify the new room had a functioning deadbolt.

We were disappointed to find the new room was not as nice and had no view out the windows except for the rooftops of the building below. Looking around the room I immediately found a couch cushion was placed incorrectly onto the couch. Fixing the cushion I found a large amount of crumbs and dirt under it. I also found the cushions to be extremely dirty and in need of a good steam cleaning. I did not want to think about the rest of the furniture that needed cleaning. Also found the bathroom door knob was loose and ready to fall out of the door.

Overall, I see a hotel with great historic charm and potential but there is a serious need of maintenance and a good cleaning.

Next time I will stay at the Hilton next door.

FYI... never got the bottle of Champagne, apparently the hotel no longer has a liquor license. I suggest that they quit advertising it."
3884,Cheap and totally worth it...old tv's but they still work
3885,Very good ice cream. Friendly staff. The sitting area was a little small.
3886,Best food in town.
3887,This place is awesome! My wife and I love the keto food here. It's nice when you dont have to pick through every ingredient to know if you can eat or not. The Keto menu here is full of great tasty and savory options! Stop in and meet the friendly staff here and they will walk you through your options!
3888,Plays & musical
3889,"Great food, fast service"
3890,Great gallery to view local arts and crafts. A very welcoming atmosphere with great art and people.
3891,Great place to stop between Anchorage and the peninsula. Cheap gas and a huge convenience store
3892,Tell me who can pass up a McDonald's
3893,Good hotel. Old though.
3894,"Tried it for the first time today and had a great time, highly recommend giving it a shot!"
3895,Friendly people
3896,"We stayed a night at the end of the land portion of our tour with Princess. The hotel was a full service year-round business class hotel, which was great after 5 nights in Seasonal Princess Wilderness Lodges. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed. The hotel is centrally located in very walkable downtown Anchorage - within walking distance of many restaurants and shops, the performing Arts Center and the visitor center.  The WIFI worked great! The in house Cafe offered a delicious breakfast at reasonable prices (for Alaska) after a 10 minute wait."
3897,"More than half of the machines are 'out of order' On a Tuesday before noon and people are waiting to wash. No tv, no music, even ine of the front doors is broken. This place feels run down and sad. Didnt use to be like this, I wont come back."
3898,Very nice hotel and friendly staff
3899,Very helpful staff
3900,Very cool! Can still get your x-country ski on here! Looks like an amazing place to adventure in the summer too! Definitely be back to check it out again!
3901,Rude management un happy with my un crispy rubbery  bacon
3902,Great food and lots of it.
3903,"Bass pro is ok, baked alaska is pretty good"
3904,Love having the mountains that are easily accessible!
3905,good bar service and friendly staff
3906,This is a phenomenal place to go for a short hike on beautiful sunny days. there are stairs in some areas a well taken care of trail as well as benches to rest along your way. The scenery is so spectacular from the top that there really are no words to describe how stunning these views are. You won't regret taking a hike to the top of the Butte.
3907,Hotel seems nice. Customers are awful!
3908,This was a super fun hike. There was a bear captured the day before. Great for a morning hike during the summer
3909,Great place! Delicious coffee drinks and friendly staff. Glad we found it!
3910,Took this boat tour twice while in Alaska. This is truly a MUST while in Valdez.  Captain Fred is amazing and knows the history of Prince William Sound. You will not be disappointed.
3911,Did the 6 hour national park tour. A lot of wildlife and gorgeous scenery!
3912,I never knew they had a nursery at the airport. It was excellent and made our travel experience way more enjoyable.
3913,Karaoke night was awesome!!
3914,"It was ok. The burger was way smaller than I expected. Burgers are much bigger in the lower 48. My burger and cheese (not melted) was very cold. However, friendly staff, tasty tots, and nice selections with drinks. I would give 3 stars until I witness staff walk out of restroom without washing hands."
3915,Kenai Auto did a fantastic job on my truck!! Looks like new again!!  : )
3916,There sellin ice cream pizzas now...
3917,Best home improvement store
3918,Okay with time but I swear there's new employees every day takes a while to get peoples attention sometimes. Drive-thru socks since they put the double lines in.
3919,Same same
3920,Lovely architecture
3921,"Soup, salad and homemade bread!!!"
3922,Amazing!
3923,"Large, warehouse-style setup with just about everything you could need for most any pet; generally a little pricey, but they definitely also have the cheaper options on the shelf."
3924,"Just bought a car and had a lovely experience. My schedule was kind of time crunched so Jorge and Travis stayed late for me (which, I'm not advertising for them but I appreciate!) It was a very fast process and I like that Jorge (from Soldotna location) didn't try to browbeat me into choosing something he wanted me to, or manipulate me. It's always a fear of mine when doing anything with cars because I don't have a ton of car experience.

One not so great thing is my battery died after 6 days (my kids left the trunk light on) and I'm supposed to have some great ""care"" they provide. I got it jumped and wanted to bring it by to get the battery checked to make sure I would be able to leave work. They tried to schedule me while I was at work Or The Next Day. I don't know how regular people function without their car starting but I took mine to O'Reilly's and they checked it for me. (Thanks O'Reilly's (and Autozone), btw, for always being dependable.) Kendall Ford sent me a text saying to let them know if it kept acting up, that they would replace it.. which.. is nice. But I need my car for work and kids and, unfortunately, I'm not in the position for it to be down all willy-nilly. So. Kind of disappointing as far as their after care service goes."
3925,"Outstanding customer service! Their drinks are fabulous! Yes all of their drinks! I have a family of 7 and there is something for everyone! My fav is the pinapple redbull kicker, my husband gets the burrito with everything and its a great filler for him after pt. My kids usually grab smoothies or milk shakes. It changes with every visit! They are usually about 4 to five cars deep on both sides so get there with enough time tk wait about 5 mins per car ahead of you. The ladies who work here are super friendly so if your visiting fairbanks or moving here this is a must visit!  We will miss them when we move!"
3926,"Lots of tools, everything you might need and even more. Great service."
3927,Really busy
3928,"We arrived at the Alaska Shirt Company in Skagway just a little late for the start of the annual 4th of July Parade, it was a great place to view the parade.  We were a bit let down hoping to see the parade thinking we lost the opportunity.  To our amazement the parade turned around about a 1/4 mile down Broadway and marched right back right in front of us.  It was really fun time bright sunshine, warm temps lots of fun and enjoyment for everyone.  We wandered up and down Broadway and wound up at the Skagway Brewery,  what a surprise.  This was a great place to visit and take in all the sights it has to offer.  Make sure you come  and visit this place when you come, you'll enjoy, we certainly did."
3929,Not bad but I asked for extra shots and it didn't seem like it but still was a decent breve and a little slow to serve but oh well.
3930,Prices are way too high.
3931,The food is good! The service is fast and attentive. The best part is how fast the food comes out. You can get in and get out in thirty minutes. Excellent place for lunch on a work day!
3932,I love this place!
3933,Nice place rude staff
3934,"Small town, nice atmosphere, but the river sucks."
3935,Convenient location.
3936,Friendly staff and good rooms. Good location for trips to denali.
3937,The food and service here was spectacular. Home town feel with a out of the box way of preparing delicious food.
3938,"It’s like a dollar store but with everything, we get our exotic can’t find anywhere treats here"
3939,Best pizza North Pole has to offer
3940,Seafood soup is amazing.
3941,Beautiful
3942,"Good food. Good coffee. Friendly service!
In the heart of Palmer."
3943,Excellent facility. Great place especially for fat people like me.

3945,"They had some good service, our server was Robert and he was super sweet and nice, their food was good and came by relatively fast, all in all a good place. Only ""complaint"" is the massive amount of cheese, but it's an Italian place so I can't really complain."
3946,"We come here all the time but unfornately the service has gotten worse and worse everytime we have gone. This last time we didn't receive part of our order, we pressed the red button at the stall to tell them we didn't receive it and NO ONE SVER CAME TO GIVE US THE REST OF OUR FOOD. we waited 20 more mins. Had to leave. We love you guys. But won't be coming back now"
3947,"Pretty much like any other GameStop, but they got some neat people behind this one."
3948,Great buffet
3949,Friendly staff
3950,"People are nice here and they keep things from ending up in the landfill, but the place is really smelly and the used gear is not a bargain by any stretch of the imagination... So we cannot really recommend it."
3951,"SERVICE IS GREAT! I do wish they had a local non-alcoholic beer on their menu. Most Starter foods are good,  however, the nachos we had were awful...not enough cheese..radishes were watery flavored with not bite to them. These could be a great starter food. PLEASE PUT CHEESE OVER THE WHOLE TRAY"
3952,Michael's is always great although the cashier made my bags to heavy. She was sweet and patient.
3953,"Can't say enough about the place. Food is GREAT. Chef does amazing things with beef and lamb on vertical grill. Chicken and fish are also worth trying.  Service can be a tad slow especially when they are swamped, but it is improving as they learn to deal with their popularity."
3954,"I took my 17 Tacoma there after getting a flat on the Dalton.  They hooked me up with a great price a set of Cooper AT3-4S's at a great price.  The customer service was quick and the guy that worked on my truck even put the spare back under the bed for me when he took it off.  The waiting area was clean and the bathrooms we're stocked.  Honestly, 10/10 would go there again."
3955,It's hit or miss on whether you are going to get a decent haircut or not.
3956,Awesomeness place jade and kelly on top of their game great pit fair prices great service
3957,A beautiful location for a wedding venue
3958,I love the service here. I missed this place.
3959,There car in the middle of the store is beautiful and rare. There prices are way way way too high for average souvenirs. Go to the Homer spitb instead.
3960,Good pizza. Decent price. It would be nice if they had a thick crust pan style pizza.
3961,"Fast, excellent service."
3962,I take my son there. He loves the park. And he loves birds. Kids play nice a lot of adult supervision
3963,"Ordered the alfredo ella Fiore? I believe it's called, scallop n shrimp alfredo and the calamari, was absolutely delicious. It looked like they make everything from scratch even their mixed drink options which I thought was awesome. Pricey but totally worth every bite. Definitely a hidden gem. Would suggest making reservations."
3964,"The food at this location is typically hot and fresh, and compaired to other wendys locations it seems to be fairly quick. I frequent this location and am kinda known by a few of the drive though crew, who greet me with a smile and a hello, how ave you been?! I love that some of the crew go that extra mile to make you feel like a friend and not just a customer."
3965,"Very friendly staff and incredible food and drinks. Would definitely visit again, although the second floor isn't insulated very well and the food got cold very fast if seated by the walls or window. Menu has a decent variety of options. Restaurant was very clean and table service was perfect."
3966,Nice selection of stiff
3967,No self serve
3968,Great food friendly staff.  Not enough inside seating
3969,Nice park.
3970,Dog friendly.
3971,"We loved walking around this historic sight, with the views of Hatcher pass, don't miss out!"
3972,"My favorite choice for hawaiian food. The poki is phenomenal. Mahi mahi is to die for, and the moco loco is a straight up day-ender, but totally worth it."
3973,"great service. Nice people
I've  had the breakfast bagle and a salmon bagle.  Both were great"
3974,What can you say - it's a gas station.  Usually not packed and easy to get in and out. The fuel discount is a major plus.
3975,I love this place. Staff is friendly and food is amazing. I recommend the country Benedict.
3976,Shopping
3977,Awesome coffee and great service.
3978,Great  place very clean and nice. Good choice for food and shopping.
3979,It's what's for supper... Sometimes.
3980,Pool good view for seeing boats some times orcas and fishing
3981,Clean great gas station
3982,The food is always great! We love everyone here. Such great customer service and hospitality!  ♥️♥️❤ Thank you sooo much
3983,Lovely place
3984,Easy to get help when I needed it!
3985,Monster biscuits  are good
3986,"Well, it's a Safeway.  Not the friendliest bunch of people."
3987,The go carts are amazing fun. Great place for kids and adults!
3988,best place on the island
3989,"Great customer service, super positive experience!! Highly recommend you shop here for all your musical needs."
3990,Live dj every Saturday night!
3991,Great food
3992,Just your regular run-of-the-mill gas station. Premium unleaded fuel is not provided at this location. They have gas specials every Friday.
3993,"Wonderful Menu , My favorite place to eat in the valley"
3994,Its ok
3995,Good friendly people. Make sure to grab some snack while you are there.
3996,Fantastic dealer
3997,"Worst customer service ever, you need to train better or do a better with your hiring process."
3998,Average Safeway
3999,"Great snacks, great candy selection always!"
4000,Clean and bright
4001,Nice place fuel is affordable especially with your fred Meyers rewards.
4002,Good
4003,It's ok but some what spendy for the type of restaurant
4004,Vey professional and caring.
4005,Exellent
4006,Clean restrooms.
4007,Love the peanuts
4008,Kinda dirty
4009,"Fresh food, economical prices."
4010,Wait was long checking in😣
4011,Typical for fast food
4012,Great Deals everyday.
4013,Good spicy chicken nuggets
4014,"Good selection, clean, items easy to find and clerks are friendly. Prices however are high unless 60% or more discounted."
4015,Great burger!!!
4016,"Food was really good this time around, made up for the last time I ordered. The burger last time was bland & boring. This time I ate too fast it was soo good! >w</"
4017,"Sticky buns. Nuff said.

Their bread is excellent and provide an easy place to sit and have coffee. They also feature artists on their walls that you can buy from if it strikes you."
4018,Shittiest bar in Anchorage the bouncers don't know their head from their asses I was denied access from apparently being too intoxicated when I just got off work 20 minutes earlier do not recommend and I'm never going there again.
4019,Very good food here
4020,Love the loaded Italian & jalapeño bites!
4021,"Although this place doesn't look like much on the outside, the food is the best Mexican cuisine in Fairbanks because it's actually authentic Mexican, unlike other places that claim to be. It's usually busy, their food is worth waiting for, but it really doesn't take a ridiculously long time to get your food like at other restaurants. If you speak Spanish I'd recommend ordering in Spanish. Although the staff does speak English, it's  second language, so they get pretty happy when someone speaks to them in their native tongue. And give their Horchata a taste, it's delicious."
4022,I didn't get to try the dim sum because I didn't see it on the menu seemed like extremely american food. Spicy beef wasn't spicy it was cooked well w high quality ingredients. The menu seemed boring I've traveled a bit.  If you like Mexican food in Anchorage you can disregard my review we do not share the same pallete or the same idea of what mexican or Chinese food is. Bty the Chinese pizza place on jewel lake has good Chinese food don't know about the pizza but best Hot n Sour soup I've found here. Rice Garden is also good.
4023,"$8 for a shower with a towel. That is outrageous, I'm from Nikiski on the Kenai Peninsula & I can pay only $5 down there. You would think that it would be cheaper when in a major populated area."
4024,Feels like family
4025,This is a chain restaurant. It has good views and is always busy. They have a nice happy hour in the bar until 6. The food was good and consistent. I liked the service. It's a bit pricey.
4026,Love this little shop. Great ice cream and shopping done here.
4027,Camping area.
4028,"I do my laundry there every weekend. Its clean, the dryers get hot, there fast and friendly"
4029,Love walking here
4030,They have no personality there don't even care if you're there or ask you if you need anyting
4031,Awsome
4032,This is the place for healthy!!!
4033,Love their curly fries that's about it
4034,Love this store.. Always organized
4035,Nice views. Some rooms are small.
4036,Still have the best Mexican food in Wasilla. Always dependable.
4037,Food lacked seasoning
4038,Good quick and cheep...
4039,nice airport
4040,"This used to be one of our favorite Chinese restaurants in Anchorage. Since we first found this place till our most recent visit, things have really changed here. The food is alright but lacking the last time we went in. The desserts looking like they are good but never tried them."
4041,Prices could be lower but I like that they generally have stocked shelves!
4042,The food is great! The staff is friendly. The pie is excellent.
4043,"Stocked with major necessities and most ""normal"" consumables. Seem to offer most grocery store items, but short on help when we were there. Still, you can't go wrong"
4044,Great coffee!
4045,Great place for a wedding
4046,We had milkshakes 3 days Mc donalds Carl's Jr & burger king was the best
4047,Nice place. Good food and service
4048,"Well managed, super staff, great skiing!"
4049,Always a nice treat when in Homer.
4050,"Unique foods, good seafood. Prices can be higher."

4062,Oldie but a goodie!
4063,"Good service, no shenanigans."
4064,"Not too bad.  The food is standard dining facility which, in my opinion, is pretty good.  They don't have wifi and they don't take credit/debit cards.  But, you can't beat the price."
4065,"Inquired About A 1999 4Runner I Seen On A Craigslist Ad Called Payless To Speak To A Salesman They Even Assured Me The Vehicle Was On The Lot And Would Have It Warming Up For Me When I Came Down, So With That Being Said I Drove Half Way Across Town 2 Go Check This Vehicle Out And Test Drive So I Could Make The Decision On Buying It Only 2 Findout From The Manager That Someone Had Already Put A Deposit On It Which To Me Seemed Very Unprofessional Not Only On The Salesman But Payless Car Sales Itself. You Never Tell A Customer A Vehicle Is Available And Have Them Come Down To The Car Lot And Let Them Walk Around The Lot And Realize Its Not There, I Even Had 2 Confront A Salesperson To Actually Get Help Very Unprofessional Dealership!!!!! I Honestly Would Not Buy A Vehicle From Them Because They Do NOT Value The Customers!!!!!!"
4066,"Good prices, great food."
4067,"I usually go to Jiffy lube for an oil change, chassis lube and (including) the 12/24/5 point inspection. Reason I decided to give these guys a try is because Jiffy lube, Mobile 1 etc. doesn't  ever do what they say their going to do. Example: 1) After a chassis lube I look under my truck and notice nothing has been touched. 2) Pull my truck out and the oil plug is leaking oil. 3) Blow all my fuses etc. Although the main reason I wanted to take it to a shop was because I had a break light that was out. I was feeling too lazy to fix myself. I noticed Simard, has some great reviews (not a single bad review, out of over 600??? on their site.). So I decided to give them a call. I ask the guy on the phone to go over their prices and what it included specifically the 15,000 mile 75 point inspection. The price was $150. He stated an oil change was not included ($99), So I asked, 'what am I getting' other than a kid filling out a inspection check list? He stated that  they flush this, they flush that and they rotate the tires...I'm like, oh cool...I am getting something other than paying for them to just fill out a simple checklist.

I take the car in at 8AM, as per requested. They have shuttle service (round trip), that was nice. I get a call at 4:15 notifying me that my ride is at my house ready to take me back to the shop (nice). Arrive at the shop at 4:50, was told my car has not been inspected yet. Waited, waited...cars good to go now. ;-) So they go over the paperwork, tell me all the minor (thankfully) issues my vehicle has. Find out the tires do not get rotated (only upon request), nothing has been flushed, misunderstanding, I'm OK with that and will take it as a misunderstanding on my part. So you are still getting a kid just filling out a checklist for $150.  They did give me a free oil change for the misunderstanding, and even offered a discount in place of the free oil change if I wished...no bother I was already bummed (because I did have high expectations) and felt it is much the same as all the other auto shops around town.  All in all I get a less than 35 (could have been 10 min what do I know, they close at 5:30) minute, 75 point checklist for $150. I will give them the benifit of the doubt.  I am not pleased or overly upset, just a bit exasperated.
As I am driving out of the parking lot I notice my Brake light in the reflection of the shop window, I think oh, ok the brake light is working I look to see if the other brake light is working, can't see it in the reflection. I thought about driving backward to readjust as to see the other brake light's reflection (to see if it had been fixed), I remembered the checklist that we had gone over, there was no mention of a brake light that was out, I assumed that meant they had fixed it as per my request...being that I paid for it to be fixed.  So what we have here is a 75 point checklist turn into a ""less than 75 depending on time...only have 15/30 minutes I'm sure they want to get home, lets hurry and make this a 75/30 ''main'' points checklist!

Although I am not overly displeased (Been there done that), I kinda expect auto shops to be in it for the $$$ and not the Job. Its hart to find good help these days, not much chance finding a kid/worker that is conscientious about his work nor is it possible to find an auto shop willing to take on the responsibility of its (unconscientious) employees. .

Update: I didn't respond or contact them. I just bit my tongue, and decided to eat this one. it was them that reached out, and kept reaching out to me until I responded. They admitted fault right from the start, I kept ignoring them and trying to push them off.  All is good, they made it right. I received a full refund, who does that? I truly believe they really try to be Honest and want to make it right.  I believed there is No way, no how you will ever find an Auto shop accept responsibility...just found one!
Born and raised in Fairbanks, You will not find a better Auto shop than Simard's. They are as good as the rest and Better than the best.
Thanks for Being Human."
4068,Taste very good
4069,Excellent food and service!
4070,Went above and beyond my expectations and assisted me in fixing what I thought was going to be a complex transaction in a simple situation.
4071,Love Arby's and would highly recommend the brisket! It is the best sandwich I have ever had in a fast food place!
4072,"I love the tea shop! I come all the way from Fairbanks, I wish we have something like this! It became my must go place in Anchorage everytime I visit!"
4073,"Good solid food, quick service and nice people!"
4074,"Really good tasty but a bit expensive, but since the park is free it makes up for it, lots of parking, RV s too."
4075,"Take one of the bus tours of the park. They vary in length. We had the 9.5 hour narrated trip. The beauty, vastness and reason for supporting our National Parks becomes crystal clear. We saw Dahl Sheep, Grizzlies, Caribou, Golden Eagles, Squirrels and Hares against a background of rugged unspoiled beauty.
There are excellent hiking trails off the visitor center. We took the lake trail and watched a Moose eating in the lake. There are remote camping paths for the experienced hiker. See the website. A natural Wonder."
4076,Love it l
4077,"Good food. If you are allergic,  ask for the allergy menu."
4078,"I really love going to Bradley House when I want to have a drink and visit with friends. It's not loud or wall to wall people (most of the time) wait staff is about as good as it gets, and then some. I've never had an unpleasant experience there❤"
4079,Love the decor and coffee
4080,"Great food and amazing staff. They have a great fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine, a wide variety of Soju, and fantastic deserts."

4086,Fast and friendly Everytime i go in
4087,"Nice place to walk, bike, and cross country ski."
4088,"We went there the first week it was opened.   We thought it was okay.  The sauce was really good but everything else was bland.   We recently went back and the chicken and fries were much better.  If you like chicken strips, it is a good place to eat."
4089,All good except no air for tires
4090,"Great customer service,  the check in attendant helped me bring my bags to.check in all the way across the airport. He went out of his way to help me.. great car upgrade to volvo. Highly recommend"
4091,A bit spendy.  Pressure on the wands could be higher. The scrub brush was broken in the bay I went into. The positive was that it was a huge bay and I could still use the scrub brush even though it wasn't pumping out foamy solution.  It was disconnected from the hose.
4092,Good end of summer sales great price
4093,Bagels! Coffee! More!!!
4094,Very cool people they stayed open just so i could look up to see if the seeds i need where what they work fr what i  needed them for

4096,That late night stop that always hits the spot
4097,The reclining chairs with lower back heat are a wonderful addition to the theatre experience!
4098,Curtious staff
4099,Service was extremely poor. Prices were extremely extravagant. It seems like the cook spent more time on garnish and flare than actually cooking the steak. All in all you're better off getting a burger at Carl's jr.
4100,Food was hot and cooked fresh!  Very good!  Great healthier alternative!
4101,Always peaceful and very comfortable on my trips.
4102,It was awesome and there is a creek right next to the camp so u can go swim whenever u want

4107,Miss my Alaska natural wilderness beauty.. Homer is surrounded by the most beautiful mountains I have seen in person.🙏🏼💯💓
4108,"Lana and the other staff very helpful. We bought 2 rocker recliners, special order leather couch and love seat all lazy boy.  Couch and love seat were either lemons or  just poorly built, the frames are glue and not secured did not make it even 1 year before frames broke. The store would not fix, fortunately we bought a 5 year warranty from guardian. We have had to use it twice so far, furniture enterprises fixed the first time and less than a week the frame broke again.
Would not buy lazy boy again very expensive. Did not last as long as cheaper furniture."
4109,"Cash or debit only.

Options for glasses or bottles of champagne.

Hot and cold oysters.

Super secret speakeasy on site. Not always open.

Highly recommend wearing a suit and tie and brining a classy lady in a dress as science shows the champagne tastes better that way."
4110,The best spray it yourself car wash in town. You can also fit an RV in their bays. I recommend using their card that you preload. The owner is super nice as well.
4111,Good variety. Great place to buy soft comfy stuff
4112,Food was good.  Service is as expected from a princess/holland america company.
4113,FANTASTIC Italian food HANDS DOWN. And say YES! to garlic.
4114,These guys went above and beyond to solve my tire related problems. Did good work too.
4115,Delicious!

4117,Excellent customer service!!!
4118,"Great place to climb, friendly staff and nice routes!"
4119,Friendly People always service with a smile

4121,Great view...
4122,"Midas was fantastic! Will do all my vehicle services and any and all tire services. The folks there were so helpful, I realized I had not had good service at all at Diversified. They did special work of mounting a new tire on a new wheel I had NOT purchased there. Diversified Will NOT mount anything new if you did not buy it from them. How greedy is that folks? They said to me they couldn't get the tire for me, so I got it from TIRE RACK on the net. They still wouldn't help me even tho I couldn't purchase it from them. They lost a customer that had went there for many years and that's ok with me due to it being so much better cost effectively and better sevice"
4123,Go see Frank! He will take care of you. We've had great experiences here. Maintenance does seem to take a while most times it's a half day job for just an oil change. Otherwise they're great
4124,A quick hike with stunning views.
4125,Needs showers and restrooms with running water
4126,A pleasant and informative tour of a section of the Alyeska Pipeline and  Gold Dedge 8.  Pleasant staff and reasonable retail.
4127,Best ice-cream in Alaska!!
4128,"Awesome quality food, the best in town HANDS DOWN."

4132,Felt like chalupas
4133,"Going to Vito's was my first choice just hearing and seeing the comments. Diego helped me with my very first car, not knowing anything about cars the staff was there to walk me thru every detail from insurance to loans they were there every step on the way. They are the best in town! I would recommend them everyday. Thanks Diego!! Y'all rock"
4134,Lunch special was $15.00 and mostly cold
4135,The evening manager is very friendly and personable.  It's typical fast food but the workers work together.
4136,I went to the Trick or Treat event at the Cook. Kids and parents were decorating cupcakes and having a good time. I was able to take a few pictures of people happy and having a great time.
4137,Serenity...

4143,Awsome
4144,The best food around and the rolls are amazing I always fill up on those.
4145,Great management
4146,I had the seafood risotto and it was delicious. You need a reservation but they do offer seats at the bar for people without reservations. The mojito was not good at all kinda tasted watered down but the other drinks I had were good. I recommend the strawberry martini if you like sweet drinks.
4147,"$5 lunch is a great value.  I ordered it  in the drive through with a blizzard.   They served it first and I had to wait for my lunch.   By the time I got my lunch the blizzard was half melted.

I had to edit the review to add another trip through the drive through yesterday.   The same thing happened to me again.   This time my sundae was melted before they got my burger to me.  This place needs some serious work on their process.   Take a look at all the negative comments and make some changes."
4148,Great pastries everytime
4149,Ducks everywhere. They were beautiful
4150,Awsome
4151,Visiting a friend

4157,"Enjoyed the food and the waitress was kind, polite & jovial"
4158,The floor crew are very helpful. I love this place
4159,definitely one of the best mexican restaurants in town. it's not on the menaul but order the colorado chimichanga.  they really need to put this on the menu full time if you ask me!
4160,Small local joint. Good donuts.
4161,"Very nice staff, clean lot and loads of truly nice autos;  unfortunately didn't have what I needed."
4162,Nice
4163,They are always out of my size. Do they only get one of each size at this store?  The kids department seems good though. I like The shoe department but it's messy a lot.. I get shoppers do that but where is the staff to clean it up.. Or to help out???? Can never get help at this store.. I find it frustrating
4164,Great coffee friendly staff but disappointed they take advantage of people who can not drink dairy and charge extra for soy.  With the recent price hike and soy a large soy latte is $6.50!  Too much!
4165,This lovely mall is OPEN!!!  Kinda quiet and still a bit empty in this early COVID recovery period. Some stores are having great sales now.
4166,GF loved the gluten free options. I enjoyed the craft beer Alaskan Pineapple Ghost Pepper Gose! A great refreshing beer that has no lingering heat but the subtle hint of all mentioned ingredients. Highly recommend coming here. A must for any local or tourist.
4167,"Just another Safeway. As with most places around here, employees are friendly."
4168,Very filling
4169,It was ok.
4170,Easy to get to
4171,"This restaurant is recommended from the local people to us.  They're beautiful view at the restaurant, food good and waitress so nice. I cut one star out because the price a little bit high. If you want to come here on weekend. I recommend you call for the reservation first. We have to wait for 45mins before we can get in."
4172,Good shopping and eating
4173,"Only drive-through(at July 2019).
bad-quality burger"
4174,A little pricey but the tacos are really dank.
4175,Pretty nice. Not too active. Staff are great.
4176,Good food
4177,Very busy.  Great service and food.  Had to wait a little but worth it
4178,Staff is always friendly and helpful. I love their big clearance days when I can get both my kids new wardrobes without breaking the bank.
4179,"Upscale hotel in downtown Anchorage, AK. A number of storefront shops are included as a shopping mall within the greater lobby area."
4180,Glad its here I don't have to drive all the way to town for just a couple of items

4200,Awesome fajitas and plenty for 2
4201,"Beautiful interior, it also has a pond you can look at in the back. There's a deck in the back with a few tables. Amazing food, I loved the fried zucchini, and very nice customer service. Has a pool table and dart game. Two musicians also showed up and my group and I enjoyed and had fun with them."

4207,"Warm friendly environment where guests are encouraged to stay and enjoy their coffee, or grab a quick pick-me-up on the way to work"
4208,"Just like every other Pier 1. Staff are very polite and helpful. The store for its size has a lot of items. You are able to get online items shipped to store. Items are sometimes damaged but you can purchase for a better price, pretty typical for Alaska."
4209,Great sports store!
4210,"Prompt food, great prompt drinks, welcoming environment.  Food has definitely  improved."
4211,Great hotel with comfy beds
4212,"I loved camping here.  I rented a tent location.  The area is grassed and spacious.  The view is nice but the short hike up the bluff will provide you a nicer view.  The restaurant cooked edible food and the bathrooms were clean.  Tip, ask about hiking the Lions head.  Its two hour hike and provides an incredible view of the Matanuska Glacier."
4213,I love the fries and milkshakes and old school atmosphere
4214,I love their addition of salads
4215,It's IHOP.
4216,$3.00 burger yum for a full belly cant pass by
4217,Great view of the Turnagain areas year round.

4219,Ok food
4220,Keep driving
4221,I just dont like there food not to tasty.
4222,"The Palmer Alehouse is a great place for good food, local beers, and a friendly atmosphere. My wife and I have been going there since they first opened, and it's one of our go to places for special occasions, or spending time with family when they visit.
The menu has a lot of variety, and the kitchen staff are happy to accommodate custom orders. Add to the high quality of the food, there is also the a great mix of music in the background, and an amazing collection of beers on tap.
For those who enjoy sports, TVs around the bar play a variety of games and channels."
4223,Totally fake and scripted. If you want to see a demo of chopping a block of wood and using a chain saw for $75 then this is the place to go. If not enjoy all of the other attractions in town
4224,My children thinks its place to treat out
4225,The best
4226,"Nice place.  LOVE the Rustic feel. Clean. Great location. Spacious two queen room. The only reason it is not 5 stars is due to TV choice, TV quality, no USB ports.   Improvement is happening since joining the clarion choice family.  For the price we paid, a screaming deal.  We especially enjoyed breakfast each morning and seeing the kind lady who hosts it for guests.  Excellent customer service."
4227,Soooooo yummy! Very friendly and great customer service!!
4228,Cool! This is my praise! Very tasty and excellent quality! Thank you!!

4231,Well worth a visit
4232,"Food was good for a chain restaurant, place was clean, service was a little lacking though, went in with four people at 2 in the afternoon, had to wait five minutes to be seated when the whole place had about fifteen people in it"
4233,Had what you need or knows where to get it
4234,"Bridgette is all about your dog. She takes the time to listen to your concerns and answers your questions. Eager to help you have the happiest fur baby out there she is willing to teach you the basics about brushing, bathing and nail care."
4235,"I was looking for a birthday present for a 3 year old and she likes Paw Patrol so I went to the Old Seward one it wasn't there, then A St Walmart it wasn't there soo Debarr I was, it wasn't there. I headed to Eagle River Walmart and there it was! The very last one!"
4236,"Food is ok, very busy during lunch hour and on the weekends. Waiting time is like 10 mins or less."
4237,"They are an incredibly amazing and caring staff who give the most genuine care I have ever had in my life. My mother had ALL of her teeth removed there and they did it right THE FIRST TIME!!!! AND, she will have her dentures within a few weeks instead of a few months. I will NEVER go anywhere else until I die or they close down. They doctors there are professional, they give it to you straight and no bull****. Wouldn't recommend anyone else to anywhere else!"
4238,Great visit in Juneau. Worth the stop

Absolutely love it"
4247,Nice photography
4248,"Wonderful, fresh fish and great beer, wine and cocktail selection. Astounding views! Great fish and chips with fresh house made slaw and cold, Alaskan draught."
4249,Wasn't bad but certainly not worth the 45 minute wait for a table. Try Midnight Sun instead.
4250,The best pizza around! The place was busy but the service didn't reflect it. Fast and great service and great food. You can't go wrong with this place.
4251,"The kids loved it! Though repairs need to be made inside the climbing structure, those things swinging are a hazard."
4252,"If I could give a zero I would. Word of advice, make sure YOU check all the fluid levels before you leave.  They will do whatever they can to cover up their mess and leave you with the bill. They caused irreversible damage and basically told us to get bent."
4253,Great ice cream but staff was a little impatient with my family
4254,Quick service and friendly people.
4255,Always wonderful food.
4256,"Most employees are friendly!

4259,"Nice Place To Be, even though I Always get sick on tire swings in general.  My only complaint is that there is too many sticks and twigs around the place, could use a clean up."
4260,Always busy in the morning and after work but it's inexpensive and very convenient. They do a good job keeping it clean as well.
4261,Excellent food. Good service. Delivery is fast. Clean restrooms.
4262,Very convenient and the plants looked very healthy.
4263,Great place for breakfast
4264,"Exit Glacier is very much worth the trip. Watch out for signs along the road showing where the toe of the Glacier was in 1899, etc."
4265,"Only went in looking for CBD oils and salves. At the time they didn't have any but the staff was very knowledgeable and from my brief stint inside, it looked like they had a wide variety of product. As per most head shops, very heavy smell in the atmosphere of their product."
4266,Had the absolute worst customer service in my life in this place!! This is getting a rate of a one because of just the customer service but the food is amazing!!! HIGHLY SUGGEST Ordering to go!
4267,Cannot beat the Baconator combo
4268,"My favorite bar in all of Fairbanks! Grill your own burgers, 2$ beer special every day of the week, pool, darts, musical instruments. What more could you want?"
4269,Clean and tidy rooms. Friendly staff. I'd like a softer mattress but that's me. The soaps and shampoo are really nice. Great to ha e a frige in the room.
4270,"After reading the reviews we almost didn't go to the Hot Springs, but I'm glad we did. The facility is dated, but the changing rooms and showers were clean when we visited. Yes, there is algae on the rocks in the outdoor pool, but the water is clear and for heavens sake, it's an outdoor hot springs! If you don't  want to experience nature, go to a heavily chlorinated indoor pool at a Ritz Carlton."
4271,"Big coffee shop fan? There is a Kaladi's cafe inside the New Sagaya City Market at this location, with a sitting area large enough for small group meetings while having plenty of tables for those who want to study or work on their laptops by themselves. There is also outdoor seating if you want to enjoy the sun. Hungry? Kakadi's has pastries and baked goods available. There are freshly made deli and salad bar food items at the store with groceries throughout Sagaya. A+"
4272,Wait staff was quick to acknowledge and seat us.  We enjoyed a pizza and all agreed it was very tasty.  A few of the locally brews were available on tap.
4273,Quality clothing at a higher price (get what you pay for) I vouch for these clothes. Anyway the location is quite humorous though. Directly adjacent is a goodwill. I love the family friendly and 2a+ atmosphere. Keep it up Duluth.
4274,"Red flannel hash is amazing, and the house almond ""mylk"" latte is the business."
4275,They have animal boarding. That's pretty awesome.

4282,Great prices and service
4283,Big parking spots and only with picnic tables and fire pit best part is only $10.00 per night
4284,"First lets address some of the negative things others have said: There were no bed bug issues. The restaurant had some very knowledgeable and talented cooks who were willing to work with our special dietary needs. The food is expensive- because it is high quality ingredients. Grass fed beef, free range chicken etc. The shower does not get HOT- but turned all the way to hot it got warm enough for me. My mother did say that in the evening it seemed like the hot water ran out.

I used to travel to Anchorage with my family when I was little and have fond memories of the very same window ledges, carpeting, and loud wallpaper. Which would be fine except that little care seems to have gone into making this retro look appealing. For example- the wallpapered wall had splotches of white paint on it and various things in the bathroom were not fully screwed in. The rooms are basically clean. However deep cleaning is not happening. I saw numerous questionable spots in the bathroom that I scrubbed myself before using. We found the beds to be comfortable and found amusement in the fact that the sliding window over the sink does not open to more storage but rather to the fuse box.

If you are looking for good wifi go somewhere else. While there are times when internet connection is available, more often than not it is extremely slow and even nonexistent. For them to advertise high speed internet was very misleading.

We spent a week here. It was nice to have the fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Whenever we called to ask for more pillows or towels they were brought up so fast! The front desk was always helpful and depending upon who was there, even went above and beyond what we would have hoped for/expected.

However there is an older blonde lady who frequents the front desk. She is so loud that her voice is at yell level on a full time basis and she does not stop talking. When the internet was not functional in our room I used the computer in the lobby. I could hear everything that woman said as she was training a new employee. She badmouthed people and apparently thought she was being quiet because even talked about people around her. She used foul language and did not keep an eye out for guests. I saw on numerous occasions, people waiting to be helped while she chattered away with the trainee. It did not take long for me to decide I preferred peace and ears without pain more than I wanted wifi access.

They have obviously remodeled areas in the hotel. The laundry and workout room are fully re-done and look very nice. The lobby and a tiny section around the elevators has been improved.
However, the carpet in the hallways is not only discolored and dismal, dirty looking- its smelly and not secured. If you struggle with walking at all and would have worries about potential tripping hazards then this would be an issue.

If you are looking for cheap, sometimes friendly service, a comfortable bed and high quality food, have a great sense of humor and don't really need wifi then this is the place for you!"
4285,Its a McD's enough said.
4286,Excellent demo
4287,Good parking
4288,Fun
4289,Fast
4290,This store....I can't say enough good about this place. The prices are always very good and they have nice items especially for a thrift store. They have a great variety of shoes and great prices.
4291,The clothes is not my style. But my wife loves them clothes she can’t seem to stay out the store.

4294,"The service was great, but slow... And I got really sick afterwards... However, I do have severe allergies"
4295,Great quality of work and service. I will go to them again for any watch service that I may need. This was my 3rd time going to this business with great results! Keep up the good work!

4300,Tasty and quick service
4301,"Found a furry friend there.
Check it out even if your not looking for a pet. The animals need humans to visit them😊"
4302,"Smallest Costco in the world but she packs a punch. A membership is an absolute necessity for any Juneauite so if you moved here recently join up. Man canNOT live by Fred Meyers and Amazon alone. The service is impeccable. While the selection is sometimes... select... (we only recently got chickpeas) the prices can't be beat in this town. I've bought everything from feta cheese to a new computer to ladies merino trail socks here, and no complaints whatsoever. Mostly the service just KILLS me though.  I'm writing this in August of 2020 when Corona fatigue has kicked in everywhere,  and Costco is the ONLY place in town where the carts are still sanitized and lined up nicely.  I've never, and I go here twice a week, run into a grumpy employee.   That's huge. This is a well run store."
4303,Very friendly staff. Had a great atmosphere for treating yourself.
4304,Omg good food.  Little place but great food
4305,Good food and great drinks!!
4306,"Beautiful here, you have the option the walk, run, bike. Very popular during the summer and you can see some beautiful sunsets from here. You'll get a nice view of downtown Anchorage, and its also a popular photography spoy"
4307,Great breakfast
4308,"Best beer, pizza, nachos, and salads in town!!!"
4309,Ever been to a temperate rain forest?

4333,Dr Harr's team is always so kind and accommodating.  Our whole family loves coming to the dentist.  I usually take a nap during my cleanings.
4334,Love love love
4335,"They quoted me one price over the phone then when I get there they wanted like 50 more dollars than the
original quote. Also it looks like the glass I purchased is this then the one I brought in. Like 3/16 instead of a quarter inch."
4336,Loved this
4337,We love this place!!!!!
4338,Typical department store
4339,"Nice park, great hosts and super clean bathrooms! The only thing I would say is an awful lot of people drive thru the campground (fast)! Beautiful place 😎"
4340,Great concert venue!
4341,Enjoyable for the kids
4342,Not much of a mall.
4343,"Silver Fox has by far the best steak, always coked to perfection. The only draw back is this is a bar that allows smoking inside."
4344,Everything we order was perfect staff was friendly. I enjoy the sports car shop next door and being surrouned by 2 brewerys. The garage door walls will be great for summer to give a out door feel.
4345,OMG!  Simply the best BBQ place EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
4346,"Delicious food, helpful and friendly service. Everything we tried was delicious! The yogurt cheesecake was absolutely incredible & I would highly recommend it. I also really enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake and chocolate silk cake too!"

4352,Amazing collection
4353,"This is my fav place in the valley for mexican. I always go here for lunch with the girls. They service is really good, their fast, friendly, and make the whole experience. The food tastes great, free chips & salsa (tastes great everytime, we ask for togo salsa n chips for family members that missed out. I always get the same thing, which says something to me, what I always order is a hard taco, chimichanga, beans n rice, and enchilada. Everything is made with fresh veggies & garnish. These presentaion is great. The lighting is lower in the evening. The tables are roomy and comfortable. The  margaritas are yummy. I dont often order one but ive tried a few different one and ALL were delicious. I love it when the owner is their because u can catch him singing which is really neat."
4354,Dress for being cold - even in the summer! Lol
4355,"(Translated by Google) Great landscape. A good stop.

Gran paisaje. Una buena parada."
4356,Very clean and fast.
4357,Great service. Love the hamburger salad and how kids eat free on Sunday!
4358,"Great customer service and a decent variety of in and out items.

Fresh coffee, espresso and ice cream as well.

Prices are reasonable."
4359,"I read the reviews of this place before deciding to try it. Frankly, I don't know what the bad reviews were talking about. This place has a 5 star menu, and we liked every single dish we were served. I got the grilled Alaskan salmon, with a cup of chowder. Both were excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly, and you could tell the chowder was started with a slowly prepared fish stock. I have no trouble recommending this place. Prices were typical of Alaska restaurants (they are all high)."
4360,It is good got to roast beef sandwiches for $5 each Classic Roast Beef
4361,"It maybe a foodbank, but you really have to look at the expiration date... They have real old food, outdated expiration dates on most of the food...Gotta look good at the bread to, sometimes there is mold on the bread..."
4362,Did laundry
4363,"Good heavens, the mosquitos! There were huge swarms of them, so many that we turned back before we got too far into the park. What we did see was beautiful, so maybe with some industrial bug repellant it would be nice to try again."
4364,Great Denali hangout
4365,Let me make this more in detail since it wasn't detailed enough. The week of April 13th we went here to get a new vape. There was a HAND written sign on the door stating to go to their other location because this one was closed at the moment not due to renovations. We get to the other location and they were completely out of Vapes! I spoke with the female who stated she was the owner and also stated that she was very sorry to be out of stock of ALL Vapes at this time and she blamed UPS. I feel like that is something a vape shop should not run out of.
4366,"Heart of a bad neighborhood, always homeless people. Unhygienic cashier and courtesy clerk. Rude employees, bad produce and just a bad area."
4367,Good alternative to the main store
4368,The service at Humpy's is beyond compare!  I am always treated like family.  The food arrives quickly and is consistantly good!  Drink and beer selections are awesome too!!
4369,"Good views, drinks and staff!"
4370,Even on a busy Saturday service was quick and food spot on.
4371,Loved this Starbucks! Use it as a meeting place for people I need to have a small meetings with. Not too loud or crowded.
4372,"Good service, interesting menu, excellent clam chowder."
4373,"Very good AYCE eat sushi, slightly cheaper than Asiana.

Cons: They charge for refills and their miso soup was a little too bitter for my taste.

Not a bad spot."
4374,Highly recommended!
4375,I used to love medical park. I've seen some really amazing doctors there and usually am treated very well. Up untill about 2 years ago. The wait times for my scheduled appointments are absolutely absurd. I've waited over an hour upwards of 3 times now and I'm just done. They are Prioritizing profits over patients and thats just unacceptable. My time as a patient should be respected and it is not at medical park.
4376,"Nice place, friendly staff, and the food is really good!"
4377,Clean and just what I needed. Burgers are always perfect too. Thanks for the Hot Soak
4378,Quick simple great car wash
4379,"Son needed a suit - great service, excellent selection."
4380,Store needs to be newer and bigger
4381,Quite place for a nice dinner.
4382,"Awesome staff. Awesome service. When the competition gets going, prices will come down."
4383,I got an Italian BMT and it was delicious.
4384,"Should be known for its pan fried chicken,  but it was just decent. The batter was ok, and  the chicken itself should have been tastier.  The cornbread muffin didn't seem fresh but made yesterday and kind of dry. The blueberry milkshake was tasty though."

4388,Good food good price.
4389,"Food luke warm, no refill on sodas, service almost nonexistent."
4390,My families favorite pizza place. The service is always excellent!
4391,"Movies, food, Best Buy and Target!

So many options for food, movies, and shopping! I love this shopping mall because it is very well organized! Stores are to the sides, and all the food is in the middle.

If you're looking for a great place to shop for a while then catch a movie, then this is your place to go!"
4392,Best golf in Alaska!
4393,"Spacious, brightly lit and clean."
4394,This place is a maze in a good way. My daughter loved getting lost on the paths to different animals. We spent 2 hours here and didnt see everything. Great place to take toddlers to kill an afternoon.
4395,The food was very good.
4396,"Onion rings were horrible, if that is there recipe I'm amazed they are in business, I had to spit them out. They didn't give me any sauce for my dry popcorn chicken, and I asked for some. Drink was,the best part even though it was in a Styrofoam cup."
4397,Enjoyable ride down the river from Fairbanks.  Saw many different lifestyles of people living on the river
4398,Typical Taco Bell - 3 stars at lunch time but I give it a 5 when your drunk at 2 am. On a serious note the only way to bust through the star barrier of 3 stars for a chain is exceptional coustoumer service.....
4399,Excellent products and helpful and professional
4400,Great place to camp by the water.
4401,Very friendly employees nice place to eat at
4402,Dr. Terry is the best
4403,"They canceled my appointment less than 5 hrs  from when I was supposed to show up. This appointment was booked 3 weeks in advance. The receptionist was not helpful at all. Just offered to reschedule. If I as the client were to cancel the day of I would be charged for the time booked. I asked if I would be compensated for this and was told she would have to talk to her manager and call me back. Guess who never heard from this lovely establishment.  These people suck.

updated 6/3/19
I was sent an email to contact ME via their online portal. How is that going to help me?"
4404,Not good... ours plane was late.... and they canceled our reservation
4405,"It's a Juneau mall, doesn't have much to offer"
4406,A lot of expired food!
4407,"I took my car in to have it serviced and was told my radiator needed replaced, so I had them fix it, then picked it up the following day. A week later, I was sitting in a parking lot when I heard a “thunk,” my car started smoking, and green fluid started gushing onto the ground. I had to have it towed back to the shop.

So you’re probably wondering “why the positive review?”

After explaining the situation to Butch (the owner), he said he would look at it first thing in the morning. Then he said “did you have to pay for that tow? Because if this is our fault, we will reimburse you for it.” Sure enough, it was, and the next morning he called me and explained what had gone wrong the first time they tried to fix the radiator. He explained that they had corrected the mistake, and that my car was ready to go. 3 things I liked:
1)	He took ownership of the mistake made by his shop
2)	He fixed the mistake (very quickly, and free of charge)
3)	He reimbursed me for having my car towed.

Butch is honest, honorable, and treats people well. I didn't have to argue, yell, beg, or even plead my case to have the error fixed. And even though I would've preferred to avoid all that drama, I now know that they do, in fact, stand behind their work, no matter what. After that experience, I'd recommend Superior to anybody."
4408,Great love that place dont always find what I'm looking for but they do have alot of crafting ideas for all ages
4409,"These guys were super helpful, really friendly, and not at all the experience I expect from going to the DMV. I will go here first, even if I have to drive all the way across town to get there!"
4410,"These guys never let me down, have been going to them for 6 + years now and wouldn't dare think to go anywhere else for my tire needs!"
4411,"It's been a while since I've been here, but these guys are still as awesome as ever.  Great service, good selection, and reasonable prices make Boondocks worth the drive from S. Anchorage."
4412,Alqays open. They should sell bread!
4413,Enjoy the beach on hot sunny days
4414,Should be declared a health hazard to the public and shut down.
4415,"It's the largest Dave&Buster's in the nation. They have lots of arcade games, a restaurant, pool, & clean bathrooms."
4416,Excellent food and service.
4417,I LOVE The Red Couch. The owner is the sweetest lady who can make a mean omelet. Fun decor inside.
4418,"Liked: Chunky pork, ribs, beans/coleslaw
Disliked: Atmosphere, consistancy"
4419,I went in because of my poor phone reception.  I was told get a different carrier.
4420,Mediocre mexican food. I recommend senor taco which is weird since I believe they are both owned by same people.
4421,Grandchildren had fun
4422,Love it
4423,"Been here a couple times now! Food is excellent and service is top notch. Got the appetizer wings, and they were ok. A little too much dry rub.  I had the tuna poke bowl, and it was phenomenal! Everyone else had wonderful entrees too.

The atmosphere is perfect.  Has the rustic feel of Alaska, but still modern and clean. The upstairs area has a great view of cook inlet and the mountains."
4424,They have the best Mexican food and service!
4425,A very holy place for a siner
4426,Great food and outstanding service.
4427,"Good food, but sometimes the wait can be an hour or more"
4428,"Ever eat a spoon full of salt - you will here!

Don't believe me or know what I mean?  Go to this place and order the spaghetti and meatballs for $15.99 then sit back and get your $15.99 education.  They'll serve you literally .25 cents worth of spaghetti with a pile of sauce made up of 3 tablespoons of salt, a 6 oz can of tomato paste, and 6 ounces of ketchup.  I'll bet my life the cook is a lifetime Camel unfiltered cigarette chain smoker who hasn't been able to taste anything for the past 30 years.  However, I gave it one star because it's not as bad as the absolute most disgusting food I've ever paid for in my life.  That title goes to the Denny's located at 1 Center Dr, North East MD 21901, at a Flying J truck stop.  ALL of the food literally tasted like you were eating pure salt.  From the fried chicken, to meatloaf, to mashed potatoes, to the banana pudding and they don't serve sweet tea!  This place is so disgusting, I've told people to stop by and see how awful it is.  Here in Fairbanks, I just tell everyone to stay away from Denny's and you're better off eating food from the dumpster behind China King."
4429,Expect to be disappointed will not work on older bikes that they sold or order parts for same.
4430,"Great Deals to Be Had On Fabric ..
Needed New Curtains Made so I purchased this on the spool"
4431,Great coffee and a gluten free option for the win!!
4432,Love the daily budtender specials!!!
4433,"The rooms are updated, but they need to be updated more.  The bed was super comfy."
4434,"Best climbing gym in Alaska! (one of the only ones, too!)"
4435,Favorite do your own hardware store.
4436,"Ya i like it, no issues so far"
4437,Not much to do.  Worst cruise ship stop of our cruise.
4438,Very interesting 'store'
4439,Bought what I needed for a good price and had lunch as well. London lines on weekends btw
4440,Good supply of fishing stuff
4441,"Needs an update, but a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon with the family"
4442,LOVE their cut of beef. Will back there anytime !
4443,Seats are very nice.
4444,You can learn about the history and the landscape of Alaska.
4445,Delicious!
4446,Amazing pizzas
4447,If its a new movie get there early
4448,Really hit or miss on service.
4449,Looks like they are going out of business 😕
4450,They last too much to serve food
4451,I walked in to buy 3 Chef salads to go. There were 9 employees standing around laughing and visiting. The place was pretty much empty. Maybe 8 people including me. The place was trashed. Not one cleaning anything! It took 30 minutes get my cold salads. No cooking involved.  Will go next door next door to Papa Murphy's next time.
4452,Love the great big outdoors... indoors.
4453,Yesterday my grandaughter had a appt with this clinic. I am so disappointed with the shaming that her Doctor and Nurse played on her. She is 13 years old and has a condition that is no fault of her own she has lived with and will continue to live with for the rest of her life. I will be reporting this team( doctor- nurse) who dystroyed her for reasons I dont understand. It seems like they were playing a junior high mean girl game. Again I dont understand why they felt the need to do this but it took away every bit of spirit she had. As her grandmother and her loving advocate I will continue to look for caring- understanding Doctors and medical team to help her. Also I want to say the the ladies at the front desk and nurse that took us back are wonderful. Im sure they get all the bad and complaining people who are having bad days or Doctors who think they can treat children unfairly who dump on them . We were treated wonderful  and respectfully by them. Thank you
4454,Really good food
4455,Basic Ice Arena for hockey and other events in ice skating run by the borough or County and the City of Fairbanks

4463,Great Thai food. Friendly service and very reasonable prices.
4464,Nice to have so close to the air base and it the only parts store in North Pole.  They also have a lot of hardware on hand.
4465,Great gift for the wife.
4466,Very patient to someone who knows nothing about auto parts
4467,Great day at the place 😀
4468,The gentleman working tonight opened the door for me when he saw I had a carseat. Not something a lot of guys would do for another man. Service was friendly and quick.
4469,Did the Northwest Fjord 9 hour tour AWESOME!!!!!!
4470,Literally Safeway rebranded
4471,"The shoes are expensive as heck, but omg are they gorgeous. However, I got a pair of weather proof boots/heels, which did a fantastic job of keeping the snow and water out and my feet warm. But the heel came loose from the boot within 3 months. You would think that $300 for weather proof shoes, would get you a pair of shoes that would last at least a few years. Oh well. They were nice while they lasted."
4472,"Great food, drinks and service!"
4473,Kids loved
4474,"By far one of our favorite places to go for Date Night. Always clean facilities and that includes the theatre floors as well as the restrooms. Just wish we could get our hot food faster. If you haven't been, go. If you're a regular, make sure you pick up a FREE Regal Crown Club Card. Great sneak peaks and movie regalia to earn."
4475,Awesome with friends... However I feel the monthly costs are ridiculously over priced
4476,Brewster is the restaurant located in the Fairbanks airport. The service is not that great. The food is not worth the price.
4477,Common sense doesn't apply at this carrs location I guess.
4478,There pizza's isn't grease and it's very tasty 2 large pizzas for $37 wow
4479,"A Homer favorite! We come every time we're in town during the summer. Great wood-fired, thin crust pizza with high quality toppings, perfectly simple salads made from fresh local greens. We love eating in the solarium with the amazing views."
4480,Flavor was disappointing in both our lunch dishes.  Good sourdough.
4481,"Country themed on one side, club themed on the other."
4482,Always get work boots here.
4483,"Always long lines, and the grocery store shelves are in complete disarray.  But they are open 24 hours, and it truly is one-stop shopping, as they carry everything."
4484,Awesome place. Love the trailpoint looking over the Cook Inlet at downtown Anchorage.
4485,"Food was very good, service was fantastic and the atmosphere was layed back. Only reason I gave a 4 is we felt a little sick after eating here. And it wasn't a heavy meal, not sure if it was the food."
4486,"Pool, breakfast,  bistro downstairs. Lots of things within walking distance"
4487,Good food
4488,This is the best Carrs in town.  The fuel island is well maintained.  A Post Office is across the street.  There is a Panda Expressway and Safelite service center on the property.
4489,One of the best burgers in town. Try the RLE Hello
4490,"The view from their deck is astonishing, great selection of food, I wish there were more Dairy and gluten-free options"
4491,Fun place to visit and very nice people. Delicious ciders
4492,Family friendly park Nd pets are allowed with a leach
4493,What a view.
4494,Best hidden jewel
4495,I went to a service to check it out not one person reached out to say hello to me. Super packed in there barely any seating I got so full that even have enough child care of everybody.. worship was amazing and the sermon.
4496,I work with the pharmacy there and they alway have good customer service.
4497,Stayed there
4498,The food was amazing. The wait was a little long due to an order mix up. We will be back for the shrimp!!!
4499,"Good food, small wait time"
4500,Best coffee
4501,Downtown mall
4502,"Great place for home/business needs and more, but hard to find a customer service rep when you need one. Customer reps need more store knowledge. They do have a few gems who are very helpful."
4503,Good service
4504,Great customer service and wonderful store!
4505,It  was  great
4506,"Decent price, good selection."
4507,The sauce is the best part
4508,Terrific desserts! Would have given 5 stars but the heat was off in the bar area and we were freezing!!! Went through the restaurant on the way out and they were all sweating. Go figure?!? The outside temp was only around 0 so not during the bad cold.
4509,"Awesome local place, the  Country Benedict was awesome."
4510,Nice
4511,The cod fish was really good but the servise was terrible because the person defiantly had an aditude and the oysters are supposed to be big but it was as small as a bottle cap
4512,"So many delicious selections, and the samples they hand out are so cool, as they allow the customer to choose from at least a handful of options. The sandwich was amazing, the clam chowder was ok but kind of cold. Will be going here for lunch again soon."
4513,"FAMILY PLACE, GOOD VENUE"
4514,"Home town business with competive pricing and great customer service,  same day delivery was an option for us and it was no charge"
4515,Marvin and Jack are awesome! Always have just you need and great suggestions.
4516,"We waited longer than 30 minutes for 4 drinks we didn't receive. Too many teenager/young workers taking breaks and chatting while clearly the store is busy. For this being the only Sonic near, I would figure the service would be at minimal, well enough to pop in for 4 drinks. Disappointing first visit to Sonic."
4517,"Super fun. Lots of collectibles, mini figures, comics, and fun snacks and anime series from Japan."
4518,It's a friendly community.
4519,I have sent 4 people to Fred now he does amazing work! Great prices and works fast!
4520,Good customer services
4521,fair prices for great tasting sandwiches (I tried almost all). It is downtown so parking can be an issue.
4522,The only place where the McFlurry machine isn't constantly broken.
4523,"Excellent accommodations - staff was very helpful, and the Queen suite room was outstanding, will be checking in again."
4524,Great parking lot for beach access. Tractor launch for boats available.
4525,"They're aren't to many places in the world where you can driving down the road and pull off one of the multiple scenic turn offs to see Beluga whales right from your vehicle!  I definitely wasn't expecting to have such an opportunity!  Outside of seeing Belugas, I hear this is also a very common spot to see Mountain Goats and Dall Sheep, although we weren't lucky enough to see then as well.  The landscape is also very beautiful with mountains all around and coming right up to the road.  The only thing I warn is that it is a very well-traveled road and people can sometimes pull off or back onto the road, so just be sure to travel with caution, maybe with a buddy or two so they can tell you when they see something cool and where the safe places to check them out are.  I hope we get to go back someday!"
4526,"Great views of a very long glacier. Visitors Center is 10 miles from town, lots of rv parking available. Very unique displays - worth the stop."
4527,Great piece of history. Good tour
4528,The best customer service I have had fixed car after ford dealer tried to hide the mistake would use them for all my services thanks for a job well done
4529,"Always loved Boscos.  Miss the space at the old digs, but it's nice to have a full service game store right here in Anchorage.  Sometimes you can find incredible deals here, like a couple of years back when WFRPG 3rd edition came out, I picked up a dozen sourcebooks of the 2nd edition for $10 each!"
4530,"Excellent tour. Cold & windy but learned so much. New ""museum"" entrance, rest rooms, gift shop very nice. Such an interesting animal!"

4540,love bowling. went on a Sunday night and if you buy a pitcher of beer they give 5 free games. but you can only use the games same day. our lane had a few problems but honestly that's fine. was crowded when we got there but got a lane and stayed til close. will defintely go back.
4541,Amazing views
4542,"Excellent viewing from the top if you can get a clear day. The issue is getting off the Flattop.
Invigorating climb. The last 10% of the trail is extremely poorly marked, causing a random scramble down the mountain until almost the  2nd plateau."
4543,My favorite place for shopping
4544,Found what we needed.
4545,Outstanding food and service!!!
4546,"$6.39 for a crispy chicken sandwich? Just the sandwich??  I will not be back!!  Period!!  It didn't even come with fries and a drink.  Talk about price gouging!  Shame on you McDonald's.  Oh, and I didn't even get napkins in the bag at the driveup window."
4547,Friendly
4548,B&N is always a great place to spend some time browsing the latest books. I just purchased a 2019 road atlas there.
4549,One plate fills the belly love the place

4553,If you're hungry it's time to get some food
4554,Out of lemon for my passion fruit tea 😞
4555,"We had a party of eight, the restaurant wasn't crowded, and it took well over 30 minutes just to get our food. My wife's fish and chips came out burnt and I had a reindeer chili dog that had no type of taste to it. Our server barely checked in on us and it took her forever to get us our checks. Hopefully the service gets better in the time to come!!"
4556,Good spot if you like malls. Not too crowded. I like the variety given the size of the food court.
4557,Grabbed a tasty bite here the other day. They call it the 50/50 burger. Instant favorite.
4558,Great chicken sandwich
4559,Melissa did a great job finding discounts and best prices for my insurance needs. State Farm is highly recommended by me.
4560,Good food
4561,Awesome place
4562,"I have been dying for some Indian food, and finally a co-worker recommended Namaste - however, I was pretty disappointed with the quality of their food. The service was amazing and our waiter was very attentive, but it’s all about the food for me!!"
4563,Love the fried Brussels sprouts. Could eat then all day.
4564,Excellent food and and service

4574,"Great service, nice atmosphere and the t-bone steak was out of this world."
4575,Their food is always good. A little on the pricey side but worth it
4576,The California burrito is amazing
4577,The girl at the front brought all of the food to the table for me when she saw us juggling multiple things at once. The service has been exceptionally good lately!
4578,The staff is amazing. Super helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to boards. First place I go to work on my longboard.
4579,Good for a quick trip to Michaels or Petco!
4580,They are really trying to figure out new ways on how to solve the problem of keeping us clean
4581,Employees clearly wanna off themselves and will scan your card while having a full blown convo with someone behind them and completely ignore you. Good ol mcdonalds service 👌 doesn't get any better than that
4582,4 Stars
4583,Beautiful 😍
4584,Staff are rude and disapointing. Good food but the little girls need to be team players rather than power trip and play high school games. Poor service if you aren't their people...
4585,Great winter activity. Friendly staff. Fun for all.
4586,Friendly people
4587,"Love this place, but the staff is super dude-oriented. I keep being asked if I'm working on a school project even though I manage a stock facility. Also, it took a month to get my order in. That being said, their tanks are impeccable, their prices are very reasonable, and their staff is so knowledgeable. All of their fish are very VERY well cared for. But stop treating me like a kid when I'm there to order a bunch of supplies for my facility."
4588,Easy one mile hike with a view if you go up the trail on the left use caution with dogs in the wooded section ground is splitting open and if a dog or child falls in some gaps 20+ feet deep. Fun fun with great view.
4589,They make my food how I like it
4590,You got they got everything you need for crafts and little things for kids I'm 74 years old and retired electrician and  I find good things in there
4591,"Hands down the best pizza in Anchorage. For someone who travels a lot and a True New Yorker, This is what pizza is suppose to taste like. This place is 2nd behind NYC with the pizza. The portions is just right it is not thick. Quality and you get a large take out for $9.99. Worth the money and the taste. This is the only place I order my pizza from. To those who haven’t eaten here before you won’t regret it best pizza. I haven’t ate anything else but I can vouch for the pizza 🍕😋😋😋😋"
4592,The flightseeing should be a bucket list item for sure. Landing on a glacier is a fantastic and fun adventure.

4605,"I have received very good customer service in this store over several visits. But be reasonable and understand that the best time to go is during the week (M-F) after work and NOT during the holiday season or in the first few weeks after a new iPhone comes out.  If you go on Thursday night at 8 pm (as I did tonight) you will probably get served right away. If you go on the Saturday afternoon after a new iPhone comes out, bring something to do because you will likely be waiting for a while.  It’s just common sense."
4606,Great Hawaiian pizza and nice drink selection.  Really decent and I will make a point to eat there again.
4607,Poor experience with the manager. Decided to use another service provider due to the manager being unreasonable.
4608,"Really nice place!  Staff were happy, efficient, and quality product!"
4609,Very helpful wants to make sure that the parts are right
4610,This place was pretty great. The servings where pretty big. The food tastes great. My club sandwich was huge. The sweet potatoes fries were yummy.
4611,A learning experience. Puts on plays and things
4612,"Perfect location, but parking is congested."
4613,Wow! The food was fantastic and the atmosphere very good. I had duck (my first time) and I had not had better food before.
4614,Great food! Fast and well run.
4615,Great store for all things record related. The owners really know there stuff and are super helpful tracking down that perfect record.
4616,A ill ways our favorite
4617,Always rolling back prices on great products😊
4618,Carrs has a really hood selection of choice beef the best.at least that is my opinion besides mr. Prime Beef
4619,"Great little local pizza joint! Always friendly staff when you either dine in or carry out. Great take out, always on time for pickup and the pizza is hot. Try a Steak through the heart; the balsamic tomato topping is awesome. The Tour de Wisconsin is probably the best cheese pizza I have had."
4620,Great prices
4621,Clean
4622,Great food and service! Delta raised bison. Similar to a sonic experience with car hops.
4623,We saw a moose up close and they have great walking and bike trails. Great water views. Best to bring a bike to see it all.
4624,"The Chips and Salsa which were once a nice treat before a fantastic meal have become the highlight of the dining experience at El Sombrero.  The flavor of the food has suffered and it seems like a lower quality product and not so much poor seasoning.  Actually the French Fries were very good!  Out waitress was only OK. Clearly no real interest in the Service Industry but did manage to handle herself in a 3 star manner to match the food.  ....and the Strawberry Margherita that used to be so yummy is gone,  replaced with a version that doesn't come close to what we were all used to. It was average at best."
4625,It is an ok dive bar.
4626,"Definitely the best quality & value for Mexican food that I've had since moving here. You can get a nice tamale and taco combo (with rice and beans) for like $7. The burrito is a little more expensive, but you won't be paying over $10 like you would at Taco King. You can also buy ingredients and tortillas here as it is a factory that makes their own products.

The only downside is that the deli is only open for lunch, otherwise I'd go back more often."
4627,"The cons are minimal, limited parking and indoor seating but the pros far outweigh. The beer is really good, great styles represented. I think for Belgian style brews this is a great place. I tasted the Saison and Dubbel, both delicious. The saison is a little more clear than I'm use to. It's more common to show some haze but the aromas and flavor are great. The prices here are perfect and the best part for the true beer enthusiast is the glassware. These guys obviously take pride in their beer and respect the styles because I didn't see a single shaker pint in the place. The shiny fermentors are on display inside. No food in-house but there was a food truck outside. To be honest the food truck was in the way of the brewery itself, I would consider moving them a little so anyone looking for the brewery can see it otherwise it may be easy to miss. Great place you don't want to miss!"
4628,Had everything I needed!
4629,Very convenient and the plants looked very healthy.
4630,Fantastic place!! Employee's very friendly.
4631,Absolute trash. Avoid at all costs. Was just blacklisted if that tells you anything.

4670,"Poor service, we had trouble getting a napkin and then no one ever came back to refill drinks until she brought the check. Chicken % mac-n-cheese left a lot to be desired. Cheese sauce was bland but chicken's sauce was so strong it over powered. Unfortunately the sweet of the sauce and the cheese flavors dudnt mix. They ran out of bread sticks but did remove that from the bill."

4677,"4.5/5

What a great find! It's on the corner of Badger and Old Richardson in a little house/shack type thing. The guy (I wish I knew his name!) that runs it is super nice and the food is really good. Basically every entree is $10 even and some smaller things are less. We usually park and walk up but I've seen people drive up to the window as well.

My only complaint is that the eggs are usually burned in the Pad Thai and the spices are insanely spicy!! Maybe I should get a clue from the name but be very slow about adding the spices to your dish! He'll put some spices in the take out container for you to use... They're super spicy.

Been here 3 times and will be back many more!"

4688,"If you're looking for low prices then Walmart is your next stop.  I found vacuum cleaner bags at Walmart while Fred Meyers has none.  The store is easy to navigate, but the checkout section is confusing because the registers aren't in a line.  I think the staggered registers make it difficult to see and move to an open register.  The employees are polite and helpful, but remember to keep your receipt handy because you'll be asked for it before you leave the store.

4694,"Daughter loves it, me not so much end up spending top much money here.. lol"
4695,"People may have bad reviews but understand this place is worlds better than other hotels in downtown Juneau. They dont have A/c but its Alaska and it's not often needed. They do offer fans, have windows that open and have heat. The staff is super friendly and more helpful than they need to be. We thought we left medication in our hotel room and they searched for it. Asked  the person who had checked in already if they had seen it who let staff look under the bed, searched the linens, kept looking until it was located. I am so very impressed. Rooms are typical hotel rooms. Beds are comfortable. Soaps etc provided. Stay here they are great!"
4696,"My Husband and I are newly weds. We decided to take their tour while on our Honeymoon and I'll tell you what??

Went on a tour with Stan Stevens in Valdez, AK.
If you want to WASTE your VERY HARD earned money, go on with this tour company but, if you don't want to just waste your money, invest on something different, by all means. This tour company sucks and the capitain is BEYOND HORRIBLE. Won't even get close to wild life animals ON SHORE for you to get a good photo. (Not possible to get a photo even with a professional camera). Save your money and go to the hatchery. There, you'll see the sea lions up close, they'll be feeding, you'll see seals up close, you'll be able to see sea otters, etc.
The serving crew was really good but the captain of the boat was the problem. Asked the passengers for help finding whales because he obviously didn't know what in the heck he was doing and when it was time to see some sea lions at ""their island"", he wouldn't even get close to them. Today is 7/7/2019 and believe me, MOST passengers were asleep on the boat because there was NOTHING else to do. No entertainment at all.
The ONLY excellent thing about this tour was the fact my Husband and I were together. That was FANTASTIC and I can't complain."
4697,Hot food

4713,"Mediocre at best for the price you pay. The staff was pretty attentive although they were sort of off their game in the beginning. Tried to get a table next to the fire place but initially had a little bit of a hard time in getting the staff to do so. Food definitely has some room for improvement. Nonetheless, the interior looks nice and well-decorated."

4754,I usually go on vacations every year. So I have been here a LOT. It's easy to navigate around and has mostly friendly service. You got plenty of food options and I suggest Humpy's or Cinnabon. Yum!
4755,Located in downtown with varierty of food court.The people are very friendly in there.Great place to hangout with friends.You wont find clothes here but you can just walk out and check the next shops.JC Penney is also in the mall

4767,It was okay

4772,Local and good deals
4773,"I've had to come here twice, once for my dog who had slipped a disk in his neck and once for my cat who showed up limping and bloodied.

Both times my pets were in enough pain I didn't want to wait till morning. Both times the staff checked me in, kept me updated with what to expect for wait times, and once the injuries were figured out, always gave me estimates on costs that were accurate and affordable. The care my pets recieved and the respect and information I recieved were top notch. I've referred friends here for their late night emergencies and they've experienced the same."
4774,"Visit frequently, always courteous and great food"
4775,My children have been privileged to use the Native Medical Center and the clinics.  Both have had health complications since birth.  We are their adoptive parents.  I worked at Providence for 16 years.  The service we have consistently received has been far superior to the care we have received in the private sector.  The communication between inpatient and outpatient physicians has been very helpful and I believe we have had shorter hospital stays because of it.  The front line admissions staff is so well trained and courteous AND if the make a mistake they apologize and make an effort to correct the situation.  I continue to be impressed.  Well done!

4895,"Good doughnuts with a twist like bacon doughnuts, you will see tons of delicious pastries here that you will have trouble deciding and what to buy. The only down side is that they seem to be open at random times and have no stable schedule. But, if they are open, be sure to drop on in, grab a coffee and a doughnut, and enjoy it."

4939,Costco!  Rocks! It's! Costco! How!could! It! Be! Bad!
4940,This is the most reliable source in Anchorage for a variety of single origin coffees.  Every week they roast up a new batch.  Great options for how you want your cup brewed.

Worked here in 2017 but really dislike the new management they're incompetent than the experienced previous ones (e.g. Scott). The new one's too young and she doesn't even hire qualified employee they just hire whoever they like, don't apply if you aren't white."
4974,Good food.  Prices match
4975,"Always have the supplies I need and the products that I prefer for my animals. Amber(nametag), and a Gentleman with a beard (I'm so sorry forgetting his name), hands down have been excellent employees who will go out of their way to help with anything."
4976,Beautiful in the winter and summer!!
4977,Wonderful and fast service
4978,Really liked the atmosphere here.  I enjoyed my hot food the whole meal.  I was also very impressed when I saw a bus-person let a senior hold his arm.  He walked her to her table very patiently like he walking his own Grammy.  A place you wouldn't be embarrassed to take a first date to.

4993,"Very nice, well maintained, offered a lot however it wasn't on top of the social distancing with spaces. If you arrived before the office closes you get assigned however after hours you are ""supposed"" to follow a map that shows available spaces. Not everyone followed the map and just parked in an open space not paying attention to the plan to skip a space between rv's"
4994,"Managers are mean, probably racist.. Food is excellent except for the coleslaw and the workers are way too much once you understand what’s going on."

5009,"UPDATE 2/19/2019.

So there has been a change in management. Took down our 5 star rating. Not many people in the resturant, service initially attentive. They gave some updates to the decor, but took down the cool plants that the kids liked to look at. We represented a table of 5, with 2 kiddos. Sushi was okay, but there seemed to be a decrease in qyality. Menu same but not the same as before. The King Crab(Kani) was dry for the 3 orders. No follow up on the meal served. Check was delivered to the kids end of the table while adults in discussion, so we sat awhile waiting. We will try it again.

PAST review:

5 star.  Long time favorite of my wife's family growing up. Tempura Kitchen though was their number one. Feel that this is perhaps the closest legit Sushi in town. Lot's of psuedo Japanese joints,  but they have maintauned a more traditional approach. Just not a sushi place though, lots of other Japanese cuisine. You don't go for a fancy  decor or hipster mixologist, you go for deliciousness!"

5049,"My Aunt still haven't received her package from me, it's been 3wks now. I tried tracking the number provided on my purchase receipt, it's as if my package fell off the face of the earth!🌎"
5050,Atmosphere was good but the food was subpar. Kind of dissapointing
5051,I loved it
5052,"Patrick does a great job, thank you."
5053,Delicious Food Always!
5054,Huge variety! You'll be walking through gardening stuff and then suddenly step into pet supplies and then gifts and then maybe the rogue sock display. I bought my dog way too many cute and tasty things.
5055,Awesome
5056,"The service was horrible! Waited 20 minutes in the drive thru, only to have my order done wrong, and then I had to go back. The front desk clerk argued with me, so finally I just asked them to refund my money. That was another 20min ordeal - The mgr finally came up & refunded my money, and then advised me it would take A WEEK to be credited back to my card...seriously? Don't waste your time. If you really want KFC, go to the one at Northern Lights & C st. They don't have a drive-thru, but they're much nicer & their store is run much better."
5057,"The staff here is very helpful and considerate. I stopped in to pick up oil and Powersteering fluid, but the power had gone out as a pulled up. The manager came out to my car to inform me and said he could grab my stuff if I had cash. I did and he took care of me. I was very happy with my experience!!!"
5058,Delicious food great service clean place. Absolutely no complaints
5059,"Not only did they rescue my baby Star's momma, they take great care of Star during the day. The staff is helpful, friendly, and you can feel the love for all the dogs there!"
5060,Service wasnt what I thought it should have been .limited meal choices
5061,Awesome place for anything boating related and great helpful staff.
5062,Gotta love their chicken!
5063,Cheapest place in town!
5064,First time here and it's a nice place so far
5065,"It was busy and it took quite awhile to place and receive my order, but it was correct and it was Burger King good."
5066,The service  was OK the food was cold and dry fries  we have problems all the time with our orders
5067,"Really 5 star restaurant.  Very delicious food and so friendly staff.  My advice is you have to reserve a table before you go there,  science its so bz."
5068,One of our favorite places to eat in Fairbanks. We’ve been back multiple times to eat their pizza and we are never disappointed. And the cool thing is you can watch the planes taxi and takeoff when you’re there waiting for your food or eating. The food is consistently a good quality and the service is always very good. This is one of my top spots in Fairbanks.
5069,"Best place in town for an oil change, hands down! Only reason for 3 stars, is they refuse to give a simple quote over the phone, they require you to bring your vehicle in for diagnostics, even when you know exactly what needs done. Sorry, I won't be charged an extra fee to be told what I already know."
5070,"Love this spot, would go 5 star but I never give 5 star unless way over the top!!"
5071,PLUR!! Peace Love Unity and Respect
5072,Any place that's been around as long as them is an excellent place to shop.
5073,"Great pizza. Problem with order, but they attempted to rectify"
5074,Good selection
5075,Duck on a flame is great but be careful and make sure it is completely cooked as it can tend to take like the fuel used to light it up...
5076,Had spicy Bass. Loved it.
5077,"Great tasting produce and prices of most items are comparable to the big box stores, sometimes cheaper. Great variety for those who have dietary restrictions or are more health conscious. And local!!"
5078,LOVE the Breakfast at Denny's ALWAYS
5079,Its ok
5080,The prices here are amazing - I just wish they had a way for non-stylists to open an account 😢
5081,"How can you run out of flats of water and tonic water, they were the only two things I needed!"
5082,Food was good but slightly different taste to the chicken and noodles... but overall I liked this place.
5083,"Big portions, regular good food, nothing special. Outdated and cleanly interior. Friendly local family staff."
5084,Okay for temporary stay
5085,Good happy hour and great view.
5086,What I had was ok nothing special. Soup was below average
5087,"Disappointed in the food. The chips were stale and hard, salsa did not seem fresh made rather like the jar kind. I ordered the chile relleno, it came out soggy. The crust was mushy rather than crisp and crunchy. Service was fair. Not a long wait for food to come out."
5088,Cool atmosphere
5089,Hands down the Best Carnitas around!
5090,Costco is a nice place.
5091,"Cool pet store. Got lots of stuff for cats, dogs, fish, ferrets, turtles, and lizards."
5092,Come here so often the employees know my order by heart ❤ top bop 4 lyfe😘
5093,Absolutely the best service I've had in Anchorage.  Tim went above and beyond.
5094,Last minute or last resort
5095,Great picturesque location for picnics and beach walks.
5096,"Good beer and great food to be had here! My favorite pizza is the Butte BBQ Chicken Ranch. In fact, I'm craving one right now!
I had a not great experience with a server a few years back who wouldn't fill my growlers and refused to explain why, but that was my only experience like that. Stop in and give them a try!"
5097,Coffee is great and baristas are wonderful. Especially Sherlin! She makes the best spritzers.
5098,Yum!
5099,Charging retail for donations
5100,Wrong orders happen
5101,"Great guys, very respectful"
5102,Love the buy one get one free sales. Crystal and Tiffany are excellent personal shoppers there for me. Great customer service.
5103,"Not as good as it was about 10 years ago, but still the tourist trap that people love visiting. If you're looking at taking your children there for a picture with Santa, arrive early because it gets crazy busy"
5104,"Went in 230 and thought i had time to look for some items i needed for bone broth, as i looked people began leaving, lights were being turned off, garbage bags were gathered, some sweeping, but at no time did anyone say, ""may help you"" or ""sir, we're closing"", nada. So i took the hint and left. Been here 30 years and never had such an experience. Obviously I'm the wrong customer to be shown a courtesy."
5105,Lively..clean..good food
5106,"The room was very nice and the bed was very comfortable.  My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the view of Fairbanks as well.
Would definitely stay here again when back in Fairbanks."
5107,"Excellent food, decoration, and overall experience. I work in Denali and this is my favorite place to go out of all the restaurants in town."
5108,Its ok. All is good but I had a piece of plastic in one of my mcnuggets one time.
5109,Great place to shop has a nice Nordstrom store jc penny and foot locker
5110,"Great food, superfriendly staff and fantastic service."
5111,Great selection of ethnic foods
5112,Great little German Restaurant with a large beer selection.
5113,"Menu has improved, food has improved. Calamari needs to improve. Staff and service was great. Very clean. We will come back.
Update Jan 30, 2021 great neighborhood bar. Servers are great, especially Brie. Portions are generous, we always leave full. Mimosas by the pitcher!"
5114,Big place
5115,Great food and nice atmosphere!
5116,Me ron had to get food boxes great friendly service
5117,Friendly staff short lines quick service
5118,This location tends to have the shelves stocked better than others.
5119,I ordered a large mozzarella cheese sticks and they came without the sauce. The employees I saw ( two) were wearing their masks but only covering the mouth. What is the point?
5120,good!
5121,Need a car? These guys have them.
5122,"Nice and helpful staff, good variety and fair prices."
5123,Best service and variety.
5124,Good prices on most things
5125,Don't drink!
5126,"Great food, friendly service and an awesome environment. If you haven't checked out this place yet I recommend giving it a shot."
5127,Nice clean
5128,"They seem to have a really hard time getting orders right, not over cooking everything, and they don't taste very good at all. I love Papa John's down south - not sure what happened to the one in Juneau. Talking to them about the overcooked or outright burned food gets you nowhere. But hey, who doesn't like burnt pizza, charcoal brownies, and chip your tooth cinnamon bites - right?!"
5129,"SBS destroys all other building stores by haveing quality materials at a comparable price to any of the Box stores,  The gentleman behind the contractor counter can help you find anything you're looking for, if it seems to be busy there try the customer service counter they're just as good if nothing else the paint counter is always available as well. When I have the need or Spenards is in the route and I need to kill time  or buy tools, Sbs is always my choice."
5130,Appreciate them bringing big name bands even if it's expensive to get them here to Alaska. I had a blast watching the Goo Goo Dolls!
5131,Great Breakfast Bar
5132,This a very nice restaurant and we discovered it by surprise. We are vegetarians and has many options. Menu is extensive and food was delicious. Lot of seating but it is a popular restaurant. Get reservation during lunch and dinner hours.
5133,Conviniant but extremely expensive and small selection.
5134,"This is a very great place to go by yourself or with a group. There are kids options as well. They accept all major cards (visa/MasterCard) and cash as payment methods. The pricing is right and not too expensive, in terms of how much you pay to how full you feel after the meal. They have daily fresh squeezed lemonade which makes a visit just to grab some lemonade a good excuse to stop in. The fries are very good, and not too salty. The secret sauce is very good as well."
5135,Must see place in Kenai. Don't pass it up.
5136,Great plays quality of the merchandise is fantastic the employees are so helpful shop there all the time
5137,Great prices
5138,"Excellent facility, everything except a pool. 5 plus stars. Club Alaska eat their dust."
5139,Always Great
5140,"I've lived here for just under a month and everything has been great. Within walking distance to all the cool places downtown, the price to rent is great for what you're getting,  and the office staff are friendly and professional. Tina King is especially great, I'm new to the area and she has been very helpful and patient with helping me with the rental process and telling me places to visit around town."
5141,"Service was great, food was great. I cant wait to come back and try some of the other things on the menu. However they need better hot sauce options."
5142,Fantastic fair with fabulous actors! One of the better renaissance fairs I have visited!
5143,"Very good burgers, fast service"
5144,It's kept clean with a dark and cozy aesthetic. Has better produce and bakery then other places but a limited selection in everything else with unique brands. I can never decide if it's endearing or off putting but still a good store with late night hours.
5145,"Excellent price, and employees were kind. Pizza was great."
5146,Very professional and always offer help
5147,Best selection on meats in Anchorage
5148,Good theater. Usually have a good selection of the popular stuff
5149,Delicious stop on my way into town! The girls there make great drinks!
5150,Great facilities but short sighted on entertainment.
5151,Always satisfied when we come here... epic burgers and prime bites
5152,Hands down best sushi in state! Always fresh. Jimmy and his crew are very talented and always impress! Many unique items on the menu and the well known rolls also.
5153,The staff is what sets this place a part. They are super friendly and knowledgeable and help guide you to the right product for your needs.
5154,I loved the strawberry ice cream but I tried the blueberry icecream and i could scrape grease of the top of my mouth. But the others were delicious.
5155,Good place.  Good selection.  Quality service and experience.
5156,Great dive bar! Love it!
5157,Cool local history
5158,Not enough activities for a baby but the older kids had a blast
5159,Wonderful as always.
5160,"It was ok; but I didn't have time to inspect,  my vehicle was still dirty."
5161,The excellent ski slope! Perfect sightsee view and a lot of snow in November! Great day!
5162,Nice for breakfast.
5163,Loved it and friends
5164,Got a great car they vizar worked his butt off for us
5165,"As a travel agent: It is best to fly the airline and get direct information via e-mail and updates. They have special programs for residents and the points can be accumulated on their air points of credit card. You have to use the points within a year because they will expire.
They co-share with other airlines. For me it was good to use my Delta # and gather my points.
They fly into Canada and USA but use their partners if you are from another destination. The staff on board were helpful and enjoyed chatting to the impatient passengers. They sold small ipads for movies and food in the cabins. We were asked who preferred veg. or not. I tried the fruit platter with cheese. Just a hint--It's not smart to serve :::: Burrito on a plane!!!"
5166,Great prices and helpful staff
5167,My 2nd visit to Alaska. Moose's Tooth is a must visit when in Anchorage.
5168,Worst customer service ever. Stepfather just recently passed away. We dont know the password to get into his laptop. We talked to Geek Squad on the phone. They didn't help so they told us to go into the store. Made an appointment and they would not help us because we wouldn't wear a mask. They were unreasonable.
5169,My favorite place for prime rib! The staff are always awesome!
5170,Free cone day!!! Ice Cream was wonderfully tasty! Staff was cheerful and service speedy.
5171,Always a good experience. The store does seem to be geared much more towards dogs than other animals.
5172,I only come to this location if I have a Target gift card. Otherwise it's stores are to expensive and out of the way for me to regularly shop here.
5173,"They have coffee and rather large pastries. However, it is rather expensive and greasy. Nonetheless, if you need something to drink and eat, it is in a convenient location along the highway and at the branch to the resort."
5174,Good views for almost no work
5175,Interesting exhibits of old mine site.  Good walk up from lower parking lot.
5176,One of 3 grocery stores/ markets... Smaller selectio s but convenient to downtown Sitka
5177,Love the beet salad with salmon. I don’t drink but my friends love the gin drinks. A specialty there. Levi the bartender is great. During summer grab a seat on the deck by the fire.
5178,This place has a lot of people just  Standing around in the parking lot for no reason or least that's what it looks like
5179,Great food and service
5180,"Only my 3rd time there, but, the bud tender was very friendly & extremely knowledgeable about their products."
5181,"Quick peek into the bathroom will be enough to give you an idea of the establishment. If the bathroom is complete filth, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. Also, I ordered a regular burger and it came with browned lettuce. It's the little things that will cause you to fail."
5182,Fun fun fun and live bands
5183,Best place in Alaska to get a coffee!! I live 600 miles away and when we get a chance to go to Anchorage- I have to stop by at least twice!! It's amazing!!! Staff is super friendly and all the coffee is wonderful!
5184,Great Service and Food!
5185,Staff is very friendly.  They we're able to get my mini van in within a few days after talking to them.  They give you updates on how things are going and when your vehicle will be done approximately.
5186,"It's a Krispy Kreme. Good doughnuts from a good chain. As of this review, Anchorage has had some time to adjust to the fact that they finally have a chain doughnut shop, so the lines have finally died down, so you can finally get your doughnut without calling in late to work."
5187,"God service but no matter what, a fast food is a fast food."
5188,This store dont like selling propane even at -9.
5189,Amazing wooden art
5190,You have to ask
5191,"I grew up swimming and fishing in this lake, also ice skating. The water is extremely cold during the summer but it doesn't bother me."
5192,staff was friendly and welcoming.
5193,Fast and efficient
5194,Great knowledge great selection of fishing gear for this area.
5195,I enjoy our Mendenhall Mall. They always have great local vendors during the holiday season. :)
5196,"Good chicken if they feel like serving you . service has fallen off , check your managers boss man .  I ordered a number 2 with mashed potatoes I seen the whole order sitting there in the warmer the mash the chicken everything ,it took them 22 minutes to not give it to me. I got a refund and bounced and was late getting back to work . really wanted some Popeye's , I feel bad because I love the chicken but I gotta be honest service wasn't up to the Popeye's standard."
5197,Played mouse on the ground. I think it's missing part of a swing or something.
5198,We enjoyed our coffee and muffins we had for breakfast. Small and quaint.
5199,Lots of fun treasures to find including YARN!
5200,🤙
5201,"Very nice people, rooms are cozy"
5202,Quick service on my return. Only one of the doors was open. Lots and lots of stuff on sale but I felt some of it was priced cheaper online.
5203,Always good food and friendly service
5204,"As a travel agent: This is one of the most popular hotels in Anchorage. It gets very crowded & the staff is polite but seem overworked.
This is where large groups tend to stay for the free wifi, Alaskan flare in the lobby and terrific if not the best WIFI in town.
There are many room types including one with 3 bathrooms. Each room has black out drapes since the sun shines most of the summery days. If you need anything there are plenty of shops inside to get your Alaskan souvenirs, or forget your bathing suit and toothbrush. They have art work to tell the history. The view is outrageous and you can watch seaplanes take off!
I stayed here pre-post my cruise and enjoyed the comfy room with just one bathroom."
5205,"Great experience, I was visiting from Colorado"
5206,Staff are friendly and rooms relatively clean. Large homeless population in the area. No security driving the property in the evening or night. Breakfast on the go is coffee and a granola bar. Don't expect to sit at a table and enjoy your coffee. Management had the tables and chairs removed because people were staying to long.
5207,Its Lowes.  Enough said
5208,We had the sesame chicken and the bbn lemon chicken. It was delicious. Nice atmosphere. A little nice cozy place to go eat.
5209,Friendly staff decent prices
5210,"Overall good stay, had a little issue with the kitchen being closed early in the morning."
5211,"Best salmon on the planet. Extremely noisey and too busy for my comfort, but fun if you're not looking for a romantic spot... has a great atmosphere/view from the balcony if you're into crowds."
5212,"great sushi, great service and very nice ambiance definitely earned all of their awards."
5213,"It's nice, clean, and comfortable, although during busy periods staff can be short handed and lines will grow at the concession stand."
5214,Sons birthday blast
5215,"They did it! They brought popeyes to AK and did it right :"")"
5216,Always a great place to take visitors. The wildlife is amazing.
5217,"Always enjoy the Prime Rib Friday! And the pizza is great. Service may be a little slow on a busy night due to small staff, but still good nonetheless 👌"
5218,Very helpful. Great prices
5219,"This place has a little bit of everything!

Salad bar, food entrees, and live crab are only a few items that bring me back to New Sagaya.  If you're looking for something from the sea then you need to have a look here.  I think the Midtown location is much better than the Downtown location, so check here first.

If you're looking for lunch then get here early or late.  The lines are insanely long and you'll spend 15 minutes waiting.  Bring a friend and hold them hold a table for you outside while waiting in line.

5220,The Wasilla store always goes out of their way to make sure that my sons gluten free pizza is made correctly! Quick and friendly service.
5221,"Good place to take your kids during the winter. Lots of perks if you get membership, including free pizza on the first Tuesday of every month! Little strict on the rules, but a fun place overall."
5222,Great buys in bulk!
5223,Christmas  gifts
5224,"Beautiful Wildernes, great hunting, Manning hot springs,  (see Maning Roadhouse. )"
5225,Great Food.
5226,"Absolutely love Frostbite! Fish taco Friday is the best. Their food is always cooked perfectly and has great flavor. You do have to wait a bit for your food, but they have helped with that by doing call ahead orders and now take out. They are trying to reduce the wait. And their new location is so cute inside. This is probably the best food in Fairbanks!"
5227,"I made a reservation for 15...all of them first timers but me.  The crew really stepped up...they already had a party of 24 scheduled within a 1/2 hour of our large group!  Who knew it would be that busy for a Tuesday.  I will say that the entire staff...front and back...did a phenomenal job!   Everyone loved the food, the atmosphere and the art on the walls!  I usually come in with about a 4 top...but I can tell you...no small party that night was treated any differently....I can't recommend it any more highly...now come taste the food....and see this terrific staff in action!"
5228,Good option to mix things up .   Great food with unique drink offerings
5229,Boom Bada Bing
5230,Long branch has some of the best burgers in town.  The only downside is that it can be hard to get service when it is busier.

5233,Great service!
5234,Always love eating here for brunch and coffee. Great service and great food

5241,Wasbgreat
5242,"This was extremely disappointing paid over $70 worth of food, dry, not moist, rice under cooked and did not come with silverware even though we got it to go, food was almost thrown on the table in front of us as if we should just leave"
5243,"Huge, beautiful park with tons and tons or things to do. There's always wildlife and beautiful scenery. Right on the ocean too."
5244,"Need that extra light in Winter? Starter tan for vacation? Or just to relax in a great atmosphere, this is the place to try. Great hours of operation. Always a friendly greeting."
5245,"I agree that its position is very high quality and its food is excellent. I know someone who works there personally, and I pride myself on new and timely service. Just One place to go!"
5246,Super high class place. Great coffee at a good price. Perfect place for a date. Can't wait to go back.
5247,"Great burger,  but the shoe string fries taste like they were cooked in the fryer,  then baked in the oven.  Double cooked fries are not appetizing at all.  There are way better places that have the same menu."
5248,Fantastic food
5249,Looks closed and dark when their suppose to be open
5250,"Usually pretty busy, mostly clean but the isles are small and it can get crowded."

5255,Great food! :)
5256,"Ridiculously busy,i had to drive to another store, but the staff was polite"
5257,Good place for drinks and a staple spot for nights bar hopping around downtown. The outdoor seating is great in the summer and makes for a few venue to enjoy the midnight sun
5258,The best time is Friday they make sea food
5259,Bad food frozen hamburger for 14.00$ slow/ bad  service on slow day would not suggest other than to watch the game and have some beer that eventually gets to you
5260,"Gas station on the edge of  nowhere, right next to nothing. Literally!"
5261,"Went on a Saturday around 1pm,waa pretty dead.

Food was great."
5262,Nice
5263,"Delightful place, I had delicious tator tots loaded with meat, cheese, etc. and a pork belly sandwich. Everything was delicious. My buddy Opie, a daschund,  was welcomed with water."

5281,I live 5 minutes away from this place but I would walk 1000 miles.
5282,Best mexican food we've had in a long while. Thanks!
5283,Service was excellent. Food was excellent. We had a large party & they accommodated us within 15 min.
5284,"I've had delivery in the past, but never been to the Alehouse in person. In person this time, food was good, but the waitress missed the mark that night. The family I was with and mine was mostly ignored throughoit our visit. Without digging too deep, it wasn't a great experience. No worries, will give it another go. Everyone has their bad days."
5285,My favorite place to go for a perfect burger! Underrated!
5286,Always great for the kids. They do need diabetic flavors.
5287,Just getting into vinyl and stopped by for an hour. The owner was a tremendous help. I will be back soon!

5289,House Fried Rice here is good and they are open late for pickup or delivery
5290,Wow. Flavor! and fun to watch artist make it.  You have to try them.
5291,Called for pricing on health certification for Canadian border crossing and vet certified rabies vaccine office was knowledgeable on what was needed and not badly priced was not terrified to take my animal even though her breed is known to be viscious only asked that she be muzzled for their safety and hers.
5292,They did our car great an did it quickley
5293,Nice place to visit.
5294,Welcome to Costco! I love you!
5295,The place was literally 52 degrees at 3 in the afternoon. Almost all the food was cool to cold. No toppings for soft serve ice cream. And the bathrooms were filthy. I was very disappointed.
5296,it's totally free and fun for families
5297,great place to sit down and catch up with friends and have some great Asian food and great beer.
5298,Its awrite just mad they close so soon
5299,Great food

5301,I did not go in! And it's kinda hard to find the parking lot and the front door.  Also The people that work there seem to be unfriendly!
5302,"What can be said of the famous Homer Overlook that hasn't already been said? Having lived in Homer for many years I can honestly say that it's an overlook, meaning that you can actually ""look over"" things from this spot. Is it beautiful? Of course it is. Is it an overlook? Yes, it's also that."
5303,Super fast at getting our coffee and nice customer service.
5304,Staff friendly and always available.
5305,Starbucks has nothing on kaladis
5306,"Good hot, fast food & friendly service."
5307,"Overall good experience.  Friendly waitress.  I had the king crab, which wasn’t the best I’ve ever had. Seemed a little dry/overcooked. Friend had the fish and chips which he really enjoyed.  They poured a really stiff drink (which is always appreciated)"
5308,love it
5309,These guys have cool stuff. I've picked up everything from games to books to miniatures here. Cool place.
5310,Found out there foods are days old no thank you....
5311,Family friendly fun festival!
5312,Good food and service!
5313,Great for fast food and ice cream
5314,Love it..
5315,Always great service and food!!!
5316,"Interesting history, but dry so younger kids may not enjoy"
5317,Love the new layout and especially the addition of Korean dishes.
5318,Over priced parts. Could find a better deal online. Price of sea foam at Walmart is 6 dollars and NAPA is selling it for 12. Mobile 1 engine oil is almost 40 dollars but at Walmart you can get it for 20.
5319,The installers were amazing.  They adjusted our shower glass to the millimeter and cleaned up after themselves.  They were also professional and polite!  Also the glass product was beautiful.  This is a great company to do business with if you need glass!
5320,Beautiful lake that has a great walking/biking trail.
5321,It is the only place for needs to go.
5322,Easy in easy out.
5323,friendly people affordable prices
5324,"I don’t suggest any food items besides the curly and regular french fries. The ice cream is outstanding along with the prices. I appreciate the old vibe and location, would highly suggest Tastee Freez"
5325,"If you're looking for a tuxedo to rent, inexpensive quality clothing, or a suit tailored then you need to visit Men's Wearhouse.

I've been a customer of the Men's Wearhouse for many years. They have the blue jeans I enjoy wearing. They also have incredible employees. I highly recommend visiting during the week instead of the weekends.

I had a tuxedo fitting with my friends and father last month and the experience was very easy and quick.  I highly suggest this location for your Tuxedo fittings.

5326,Reliable place. Helpful every time I go in. Good place to try and hunt down some used gear for reasonable prices.
5327,Changing winter tires
5328,They always have most of what I need!
5329,Only reason for the second star is because we like the location. We used to stay here all the time when we lived in Alaska and it was awesome. Now this is the most dishonest hotel I've been to in a long time. Supposed to get a essential employee discount but was told I'm not a medical worker so I'm not essential. Even with proof there own governors mandate still nothing. Rude front desk and manager on the phone while making the reservation and when checking in more like we were a nuisance than a paying customer. Pool and everything is closed even though the state is supposed to be open. I know COVID-19 has everyone all jacked up but this is ridiculous. Don't recommend and will not stay here ever again!!
5330,"The coffee is good, it's the coffee card situation.  I have never received my 10th drink free at any of their locations.  It seems I'm in the system then find out I am not in the system just frustrating. I go to perk up at least twice a week for at least 2 years you'd think I had hit the ultimate 10th cup by now."
5331,Not really 4 stars but more than 3. A lot of things to choose from.
5332,Awesome!!!!
5333,Love the burgers!!!
5334,"2020:3 star: PIzza is not the worst in town ,but definitely not convinced me it is worthy of the frothing mob that praises the tooth as the end all be all. Wife got me a philly from here and sadly I have to say it was the worst Philly cheesesteak I have ever had. Seemed to be made with the ""cheese"" that is put on convenience store nachos. Extremely offputting. I would still avoid eating in, COVID or not. Takeout or bust for me.

2013: 4 star: I never have or will dine in, it's a frivolous idea to go there to eat. I always call-in an order, always pizza. Some pizzas are better than others, I won't say theirs is the best either, but it's good. The growlers are nice to reuse, and the staff is generally good about their job and speed at which they can do, I have had some issues but they are few and far between"
5335,The owner treats her employees horribly. Never will I patronize a shop that forces teen girls to work on Xmas day 🤢
5336,Great rates
5337,Nice place for.kids and dogs to play
5338,"The Greek Salad and garlic bread loaf for ~$14 is awesome for the price. You can easily share this salad between 4 people. Their pizza is nothing amazing, but the Chef's Mistake is a decent enough pizza. I always recommend this place to people for the Greek Salad. They have a salad bar at lunch but it's pretty depressing in terms of variety. Their Diet Coke is the best tasting Diet Coke I have ever had for some reason."
5339,This place is terrible. They charge extra for Caesar dressing or any extra salad dressing for that matter. The food is overpriced in Hit and Miss depending on what you get. Some of the food is okay. Service is decent but can be questionable at times
5340,Great food great service
5341,The food is really good. I think most of it is homemade. The little gal that works there is friendly.
5342,"One of the few places to get coffee that isn't Starbucks in the ""Disney Land"" like old West town of skagway. Had their version of the mocha which wasn't very chocolatey but was very smooth. Sat and read a book. No wifi available. Smoothies sounded good but I didn't try one. Staff was friendly."
5343,"I'm pretty sure this place is a homer icon, but frozen burger patties is not ever the way to go. I'll give them one more chance for the ice cream."
5344,It was nice and clean. A couple of doggie bombs but that was it. Clean place to run around with the kiddos and get their energy out.
5345,"Love this store, associates in the wood dept. Went out off their way to find me a good deal, then pulled it all out for me and put it in the cart."
5346,"Starbucks blows.  Flying Squirrel coffee is where it's at. Better coffee, nicer baristas"
5347,"I cannot say enough about the scenery! The openness of the wilderness seems as if you are one of the only people left on Earth! The air is so clear, the sky so open & close (even though it was cloudy and misty!) Wonderful! Enchanting!"
5348,good foood
5349,Good shopping
5350,"Lots of nice holiday decor. Not a bad place for a quick visit. It's also a charity and they help the homeless, so it's a good place to support."
5351,This place looks a little older. It really just needs a little love and care applied.
5352,Wow foods
5353,Trivia is fun! The drinks and food are tasty.
5354,"Not a bad exchange, has furniture, guns, electronics, outdoor living, clothes, jewelry, alcohol, housewares, etc."
5355,A great rest area and very well done to honor our Veterans.  My kids had learned from here and we love to stop for a picnic.
5356,"Big selection, quick service"
5357,Love this park plenty 9f space for parents to sit and enough park equipment for all the kids
5358,ALASKA
5359,"A gem in the making, but it is not there yet. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and they keep the camp area very clean. Anchorage needs to make an investment in infrastructure to upgrade the bathrooms and provide information on their website that describes the site sizes and the electricity capacity. It is by far better than the parking lot campsites that are in Anchorage and still close to all the action."
5360,🥶
5361,"What a surprise to see sonic lit up on the drive through wasilla last week. I visited for lunch Monday. Pretzel order had only one single pretzel twist, although it was quite delicious. The cheese dipping sauce needs improvement. Onion rings were great. Mozzarella sticks were great. Large cherry oreo shake was enough to finish as a snack a few hours later. Double cheeseburger was still somewhat satisfying as microwaved leftovers the next morning. When the hell did alaska get a sonic restaurant though..."
5362,"Get the unlimited wash plan! My car is finally clean all year round. Yes, winter too!"
5363,"Good food great service! Sirin (totally spelled wrong, sry) was very attentive and a great waitress."
5364,"Great service, Quick Service, and delicious."
5365,They do have heating oil there
5366,These people know how to order the right part for older vehicles.
5367,If you're looking for great views of Anchorage as well as some great hiking trails the chugach state park won't do you wrong. I've lived in a few places but no where can you get so far into Wilderness while still being in the city. It's tons of fun even when the temperature is near zero
5368,Best Burgers
5369,They sent open
5370,So amazing. My friend and I all 24 year olds and older extremely enjoyed the Alaska Sea life center. The bird viewing area is a must see. The best part about the SeaLife center was that all of the exhibits you could see above water on the 2nd floor and below the water on the first floor. Another great part is that you can come and go all day. Definitely worth going to see.
5371,Good help staff
5372,Friendliest customer service experience at McDonald's in a LONG time. Friendly smile and food was fresh and HOT like it should be. ☺
5373,"Quality just not there.
If you want to eat a random pizza, yes, it is a place but if you want a real pizza like any pther location of pizza Hut, it is anot great choice.
A good place for a family to eat a pizza together but I do not recommend it for a romantic or formal ....meeting."
5374,Wait time was kinda long for no one being in there. But good food.
5375,Best place for Ice Dogs hockey and beer
5376,Clint is the best!
5377,All the staff were super friendly and efficient. Rooms were clean and they still have the pool open and hot breakfast when asked... Nice job!
5378,"A lil more expensive ,but well worth it!"
5379,Best coffee I've had in Alaska.
5380,Favorite place
5381,Relaxing place to watch and movie and grab some amazing tasting pizza.
5382,"Ok Walmart, many items out of stock. Not unusual in Alaska."
5383,Limited cashiers when i shopped but its always a good place to go to get quick items..
5384,I find lots of great products at this Costco!
5385,"After many issues with the office, appointment day arrives & I recieve, yet another call, about an issue that they got confused on. I go, but, decided to take witness in with me because I knew I'd need one. Sure enough, the ""Dr."" Adam Ellison, comes in, just starts picking up injured arm & pulling it up, without asking me, while telling me what my problem was, without even looking at MRI, I ask him not to do that to my arm (massive pain-work injury)he got very huffy, walks out of room. Few minutes later  I/We hear him outside the room : We're gonna do an injection on this shoulder. Get it ready. The MRI ever download, yet?"" & walks in, & proceeds to be, one of the  rudest, arrogant Dr's I've met.
When asked why he said that before even seeing a picture ""I dont have to! I read this little bit in your report. Injections haven't worked previously, pills didnt either, so we're giving you an injection."" What?! That makes NO sense. No you're not, you havent opened MRI yet."" ""What?! *smacks mouse down to move cursor, waves cursor over 2 (2!) pictures of hundreds, ""I cant even really see anything with these pictures, so, theres no injury & you dont want me examining you (noooo, I didnt want him moving my arm w/o telling me, etc.). As I remind him he was doing this w/o even LOOK AT THE PICTURES, he began shouting over me (in front of witness & the obedient nurse), goes to grab my arm THEN DROPS IT ROUGHLY so it fell, & was just..arrogant, jerk that will still bill my WC insurance though. That's ok, I already complained to them about his services & was ok'd the change of provider due to it. Also? This guy said, several times, there was no injury to my arm & even if there was, it wasnt that bad. Really?! 2 Other Dr.s have seen & pointed out, cracks in bone & tears of muscles, yet, you are SO smart, you dont even need to be thorough, you just dictate. I only went because I thought I had no choice & was stuck within an, incredibly, inept system. The folks that saw issues  are not ORTHO so they couldn't help me, beyond pointing out what should/shouldn't be there,, etc. You cant just pad Bill's then call yourself a Dr. I told him ""No, I will not be waiting for her to prep my shot. You're not even listening to me! I'm getting another opinion."" Guy replies, WHILE WALKING OUT OF ROOM,""Ok, Whatever. Bye, have a good day."" I'm glad I brought that witness. She was absolutely, FLOORED.SPEECHLESS!! On to the BBB & searching for a good Dr.who listens & has patience w/its patients. YOU PEOPLE ARE NOT LITERAL GODS!! Hate to break it to ya, but, you're not."
5386,Always friendly ladies
5387,Im lovin it!
5388,Customer service are excellent.
5389,They have everything I needed employees were knowledgeable
5390,"Great location and very friendly staff. Usual work out room, pool and breakfast spot on property. Rooms are comfortable although not updated. Looks like airlines put their folks up here which I'm not sure if that's a good sign or not. Lol"
5391,"Tremendous cheese pizza and hand made pasta.  One night after a pick up order, my car broke down.  The restaurant kept my food warm and delivered it beyond their delivery area.  My day was terrible, but their service and food changed my night.  Extraordinary."
5392,AWESOME LOCAL SKI AREA!!🎿🖤💛
5393,The biggest store in town. Also a community gathering place of sorts.
5394,Still no job. But they where very helpful anyway.
5395,Good
5396,Awesome
5397,"Went in over the weekend to try the stuffed pasta all you can eat menu and they STUFFED US!!?? 😂😂😂
Very tasty and hot fresh and fast Theresa the Manager was very nice and offered us desert cause we had waited 10-15 min before we got a waitress to come take the order."
5398,Really good food. Really friendly service. Thumbs up :)
5399,Fun for walk or playing around.
5400,"Fantastic food and hospitality, the atmosphere was excellent. Thank you Gallos"
5401,Find Treasures. A fun place for second hand treasures.
5402,"They have a great program, helping feed the community."
5403,"The rooms are smaller then expected, but they have a great city view and comfortable."
5404,Use the McDonald's app for regular discounts just make sure you open it up before you enter the restaurant most times it won't work in store
5405,Nice shopping place.
5406,"Nice park by the river with a boat ramp, some picnic tables, and a playground."
5407,Amazing food! They will even make your crepe custom if you have allergies! And the staff is always friendly and super polite!
5408,"All Alaskan inside and out, VERY GOOD FOOD and nice staff. We are there often!"
5409,Blown away by the quality of this pizza! Would give 6 stars if I could!
5410,Beautiful place to visit.  I recommend it.
5411,"Beat Photography Store in Alaska. My favorite brands of camera equipment like Fujifilm, Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Panasonic, and every major piece of camera equipment that you could use. Very specialized equipment available as well, lens rentals, body rentals, etc. Best Camera Store in Alaska."
5412,Super tasty burgers and specialty drinks! Loved the decor and ambiance! We'll go back again and again! Be sure to try their elk burger! Yummm!
5413,This is a gem of a place. I would give 5 stars if it would create a plant based dish option or two!
5414,"Great funky little neighborhood lunch spot with a chill, creative vibe and good range of options. Sat at the counter and ordered the pulled pork on brioche with mango BBQ sauce. Service was quick despite prominent disclaimers about varying wait times for certain dishes. I left perfectly satisfied and will be back the next time I’m in the Spenard area."
5415,Good coffee in the shop!
5416,I came into this coffee shop with a couple of kids and was treated poorly. The children were very well behaved but I was put out by how they treated me and truly the coffee was very expensive and all not all that special for the price.
5417,"Excellent store! The biggest selection of comics, merchandise, game components, accessories, or anything nerdy north of Wasilla. Employees are very friendly and helpful. They host Magic:The Gathering events and are on the Wizards of the Coast website. Usually pretty busy but there is rarely a line."
5418,Went Cross country skiing here what a blast
5419,Very interesting facts about salmons
5420,Always a good choice. Fast friendly and taste is beyond good :) The beer selection on tap is amazing as well.
5421,Good bbq
5422,The best. They presented my pizza to go to make sure I was in love.... If only for a night. Sigh.
5423,Bianca is one of the best dog groomers that's handled my dog.  He gets excited when we pull up to the business.  He loves the doggie treats he gets afterwards too.
5424,Love this place !
5425,"Excellent, the sides were a treat!"
5426,"It's just a regular Taco Bell, but they have never gotten my order wrong and the workers are always easy to deal with.  The drive up is a little tight for bigger vehicles."
5427,"Absolutely great service and great food! The atmosphere was lively but fun! You can eat have fun and not feel rushed! Great dine in! We loved the Sampler, Halibut Cheek Entree, Raspberry Mojito, Peach Bellani Spritz, Seasonal Cobbler, and Key lime pie! I would definitely come back and try other items and their steak! Looked and smelled really good from other tables! I had my birthday here and was welcomed with birthday wishes and even had a card and table decorated!

Coming back soon!"
5428,"They take care of all of my pets! Fair prices, and fast! Love them!!"
5429,they're cool!
5430,June 2018 Good place to start checking out Fairbanks. Some display and good source of info as a visitor info center.
5431,They are very friendly and welcoming
5432,This is our favorite park in Juneau!
5433,Wonderful place
5434,Best place I have been to so far in the valley
5435,"No words...different tasting Mexican food, unlike any other I've tasted."
5436,$1 mellow yellows from the kids !
5437,"This is a neat place to go for drinks, day or night. Their fried calamari is delicious and I recommend it over many other places that serve it. The only downside to this place is that it's almost always overly crowded, but I suppose there is a reason for that!"
5438,The kids loved the new playground.
5439,Nick does such a great job on Justin's Beard
5440,CRAB & MACADAMIA NUT STUFFED HALIBUT-- Delicious!
5441,Well since we only have two movie theaters here in Juneau it's one of the other
5442,"Wonderful.  I, did found,  everything. I, was looking for.  Thanks"
5443,Pizza could have been better
5444,Amazing food and amazing service. You won't be disappointed.
5445,Over priced restaurant.  Average food. The different selection of gin is a joke. You could make a better gin and tonic at home.
5446,Great. But had problems finding something abd it was difficult to find someone to help
5447,"Great food, spectacular service. Just a great place"
5448,ALWAYS the best! Whenever I get the chance I get a true Alaskan treat....Arctic Roadrunner mmmmmm
5449,Best in town
5450,They will spend time taking care of you
5451,"They have been changing my wife's oil, and using the wrong filter.  When I brought it to their attention, they said they would talk to Ford about what could have been damaged.  No communication from them since that happened, over a month ago. Ridiculous customer service."
5452,Slow
5453,Soso.... tasted commercialized
5454,"Friendly,  they even told me about a offer that I didn't even know I had available"
5455,Nice staff.
5456,Great boutique bookstore.
5457,"Friendly staff, painful prices."
5458,It was crowded when I got there for lunch but with plenty of seating it didn't take long before we found a table. The food came out quickly and was very tasty. All around a good option for a local burger.
5459,This is the worse BBQ i have ever had in my life. It doesn't even deserve a star. It belongs in the trash.
5460,Walmart - A one-stop-shop for everything
5461,Great lettuce wrapped burger
5462,Balthazar is great and honest
5463,"Great place for business presentations, dinner."
5464,Good food but they serve the hot sandwiches like a cheese stake so you can't pick it up without making a mess and then they put it in a little basket so it's hard to cut up. Great cheese fries though
5465,The best service salesman Aaron you must see him for better deal
5466,Wide variety of dresses. Great customer service
5467,Usually not very busy and they have grooming and daycare available! Multiple checkers are on staff during busy hours such as the weekends.
5468,"With constantly revolvinginventory, Curtain Call always has something new! Easily navigable to find your size/style, they have lots of inventory to choose from"
5469,Food and service was great.
5470,Great coffee
5471,This was the best hamburger that I have ever experienced
5472,It had liquor in it that's it.
5473,A Great service they do.
5474,Always my choose in town. Hotdogs potatoes wedges are always on point. Staff is always courteous. Facilities are always clean.
5475,It works if u work it. Keep coming back!
5476,"Great customer service and friendly staff, store is clean and organized."
5477,"(Translated by Google) The flora is coniferous and the fauna is seen far away.

(Original)
La flora es de coníferas y la fauna se ve muy lejos"
5478,Great place to go found what I was looking for
5479,Went in with a friend good air conditioning
5480,"They are a tad bit more expensive than literally everywhere else in the valley and shameless about it. $7-$14 joints where they would be $5-$7 in very similar THC %s.

They have more variety of carts but they're a but more expensive ($15-$20 more) than laughing salmon or even bad grammar.

They aren't open to suggestions by any means and act as if your knowledge on weed is in question because you are not behind the counter.

Other places ask what you want, here they show you what you want."
5481,Great anniversary meal and great service.
5482,"Just ate here after searching for a good Pho place. Fast, very friendly, and the food was excellent.  Nice and clean, so glad we found this spot!"
5483,Good food but fires were very very salty
5484,"Oh my gosh.
Wonderful"
5485,Great service with a smile
5486,Great
5487,Definitely not as good as DQ for icecream. Also corndogs are awful here. Alaska needs an in and out
5488,"Been going here for years, Egg rolls are one of a kind...Always great hot fresh food and the service is professional."
5489,They make my food how I like it
5490,Very nice
5491,My favorite smoke shop. Way Kool people.
5492,Great insurance and prices
5493,"Best of the Best, Does a great job every time I've used them."
5494,Great service and Great Bloody Mary's

5497,"Some good stores here. Bass Pro, BB&B, Michael's. Good food too Xalos, Kriners. Need yo fill the remaining spaces."
5498,Painless truck rentals
5499,"Really tasty food, they have lot of organic ingredients which is a good point. The dishes are a litle bit pricey but how I said it is worth it. The four star instead of five is becsuse the server who served us. She was not kindly at all and waited a lot to order."
5500,Moving company
5501,"I ordered a thin crust and got regular, I called and they said there is nothing they can do. This will be the last time I order from them."
5502,"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Pinto and the staff. If I could rate 100 stars I would!!
Every single encounter has been great. Dr. Pinto is well...just absolutely amaze balls!! Very very very (I can’t emphasize it enough) comforting to our nervous dogs and our hyper active dog! No one but my husband has been able to just sit down with our nervous dog and have him just get comfortable. No one until Dr. Pinto! She sat down and it was like she was the dog whisperer!
Explains things in a way I can understand and gives options suitable for not only my dog but me as well.
Ally and Sheena have always went above and beyond with our pets and truly make me feel they love them with each encounter. Plus they deal with my crazy fur mom tendencies without making me feel like I’m a burden.
Michelle and Misty at the front desk were so very helpful and also so patient with me for the process of getting them ready to travel overseas.
I am already so sad for when we have to leave and find a new Vet."
5503,It was a really good store just not my style
5504,All I gotta say is it taco bell
5505,"So fun; music; unique crafts (look for the ""made in Alaska label"") food! A nice little place to wander around."
5506,Are waitress was awesome even though it was a busy rush for her she took great care of us
5507,I visited the Papa John's on Fort Wainwright and horrible doesnt adequately describe how awful the cardboard pizza we ended up with.  I've had thin crust pizza before and never was it as dry and over baked as the two we received.  I will say the people were nice but it did little to ease the fact that I had to throw away an entire box of pizza.
5508,The waiter was nice the food was real good
5509,"On a Saturday, we had a dental situation with our 11 year old we wanted assessed by a professional. They fit us into their schedule same-day. They were friendly and professional. I was impressed and plan to go back there for future dental care."
5510,Super clean and very nice hotel. Also convenient to get to the airport.
5511,"Drive Parks Highlway and be amazed with the views of Alaska! From Anchorage to Talkeetna -Denali -Cantwell and all the way to Paxson. Stop for a yummy burger at MacLaren River Lodge. Continue your drive to Glenallen, gas at The Hub and it’s your choice if you want to visit Chitina and see the Copper River that provides the World Class salmon. And from Chitina, continue your journey through the McCarthy and visit the abandoned mine in Kinnecott. After Chitina, proceed to Valdez and visit nearby Solomon Gulch weir. From Valdez, you can drive back to Anchorage via Richardson Highway and drop by in Eureka. Eureka is a beautiful place where you can see rainbow on the other side of the highway and the other side may either be dark with heavy rain or bright sunny. This is the place to be for hunters. Game Unit 13  where caribou is taken 2nd week of August by Alaskan Residents. A place to be to go four wheeling! Berry picking ! Photo shoot by the monument!"
5512,"Great big blankets 90""x80"" for under $30. Nice little gift for Christmas."
5513,"Best cuisine in Fairbanks. You will never have a bad meal or experience. 5 star service from the moment you walk in till it's time to depart. You really want to make reservations because the evenings fill quickly. I'm not into wine, but if you are, I would say they have the best selection in interior Alaska."
5514,Delicious 😋
5515,"Best fast food place in the valley.  Next to Papa John,s"
5516,Gotta love their friendly staff
5517,The Alaska cheddar burger is great. Short staffed to provide great service.
5518,Love it
5519,"just a few steps away from the beach, the clean,  fresh ocean, and fantastic views to the northeast!
A favorite local spot for taking pictures of the Aurora Borealis"
5520,Very nice place to eat for breakfast and lunch (especially when you have a hangover *ahem*)
5521,👍
5522,Checked this place out on a recommendation from local people. It was awesome. The food is amazing. They sell moosetooth pizza and other items. I had the steak taco and they were great. Watched RBG. They have two different flicks every night. Good place for dinner and entertainment on a business trip.
5523,"Food was mediocre, some of it was over cooked. Service took a long time, and the price was very high for the quality of food and service."
5524,"Staff was friendly and great at explaining steps to my son (5 years old). Doctor was friendly and made my son at ease. Also atmosphere is VERY kid friendly, great waiting room, new toothbrush and paste, even a coin to stick in a machine to pick a prize. It was a great experience.

I schedule every 6 months so I don't have much trouble - When my son needed dental surgery the staff was great with how to get in contact with the hospital, scheduling and everything I needed to be aware of."
5525,My grandbaby was convinced here! :)
5526,Love this shop!
5527,Their knolegable staff is second to none
5528,Great food
5529,The best place to cool off in the summer.
5530,"Today was the first time we ate here. Brought folks from out of state (don't worry- they got their negative Covid tests results back BEFORE dining here). Everyone said the same thing- we enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and service- we will be back!"
5531,Horseback riding
5532,Clean rooms and pool. Great continental breakfast.
5533,This is always a clean grocery store.  About half of the cashiers are pleasant.
5534,Overpriced
5535,Great fun place to hang with your friends. The special events are great and a movie with dinner even better.
5536,Good to visit occasionally if you can find one.
5537,"AK Air staff are always friendly and helpful.

Security line is never too crowded in early mornings for my work flights and TSA there are easy to deal with.

Not much here for food or stores."
5538,Generous portions on the fish and chips
5539,"Did a lunch stop and wasn't disappointed. Nice staff and great food. Usual parking issues, but worth the trouble"
5540,Omg really good if you want to go seek off with your wife and kids really good food done mexican style   ..ooo and they have chips and salsa  not like taco king it burrito king ..that charge. Chepos really good food and fast if you are on a hurry. Ready for ordering also on a bigger plate of food  ..I love the chimney changas. Really bigger than mexico in Alaska...best so far...
5541,Great place to eat
5542,Okay outdoor gear.

5544,"Great coffee, awesome sandwich and breakfast burritos."
5545,Nice place
5546,"Cozy family owned restaurant, with great breakfast!!!"
5547,"Fun for all ages, theres a plethora of activities that can be done in and around the mall."
5548,Best restaurant in town. I was so pleased that after 13yrs of being away from Alaska the food is just as delicious as it was before. If not better. I love the garlic pizza with a light beer.
5549,The 5th Ave Mall is a place for everybody!!
5550,Cute wine spot across from Nordy's. Good selection of wines and cheese platter was tasty.
5551,"This is more review of the DMV than the shopping center itself. We scheduled my  daughter's driver's test in early September, drove from Homer (an hour +), only to show up and it was closed due to 'Alaska Day'. Really?! Why would a business schedule road tests on a day they are closed! And then fail to notify them or reschedule. Think they'll reimburse us for the lost wages and money spent? Hahaha"
5552,The birthday party was awesome and the games were great
5553,"Whale watching was good but the boat was pretty far from the whales making it harder to see. The ""port"" is full of tourist shop not much else. No cellular connection there :("
5554,Smooth baggage handling coming and going
5555,Consistent quality of service and food. Staff is always so welcoming and the food is always delicious!
5556,The airport luggage guys are very reliable and friendly and the facility is located very close to the arrival and departure gates.
5557,"Love the brews, love the atmosphere. Great restaurant!"
5558,Good food good waiter
5559,The spicy shrimp tacos were great. Pizza by the slice or whole. Burgers. Wraps. Apps. Beers and wine and cocktails. Great place.
5560,Best nuggets in town and great burgers. Could use another store but happy this one isn't on base haha 😅.
5561,"Pure wilderness!  Every 100' of elevation gain yields unsurpassed vistas of the Chugach Mountains.  A hearty climb to the Pass- NOT for the faint of heart.  The trail goes for MANY miles into the Chugach National Forest all the way to Eklutna Lake some 20-30 miles through raw Alaska, Brown and Black Bear filled wilderness."
5562,Decent Italian food.  The food and flavor were good however not outstanding.  The staff is very friendly and the restaurant was clean and inviting.  Felt like family.
5563,Always get treated great here and the food is awesome.
5564,"This is the BEST. DAMN. BREAKFAST in Juneau. Period. Awesome staff, awesome food."
5565,Really slow service
5566,"Very expensive, but very cool pieces"
5567,Thank you good job
5568,"Its a government agency, and yet you still expect timeliness, efficiency and courtesy? Get your paperwork in as early as possible and it will get done... Eventually"
5569,"Downtown restaurant clean well lightened. Food was good and service was friendly.  Prices were a bit expensive,  but over all a good time was had.."
5570,Good food. Great views. Great seafood chowder.
5571,"A must stop in Juneau for any dog lover is to pay homage to Patsy Ann, she was and continues to be the ""Official Greeter of Juneau"". While deaf from birth, Patsy Ann had the ability to 'hear' steamship whistles and never failed to greet a ship. Patsy Ann died in 1942 but her presence is still here in this statue. Visitors are encouraged to ""greet her and touch her and in leaving, carry with you the blessings of friendship through your life's journey."" Thanks Patsy Ann!"
5572,"My wife and I stayed in an RV on the campground; I went on for a day of halibut fishing on one of their three boats. We enjoyed our time with both of these. The campground was very clean. Good access to restrooms, level sites, and a nice laundry facility. Not the best view of the water, but its a short walk down to the beach and you get all the amenities that you wouldn't get at the state campground on the water.

The charter boat was excellent. I had Seth as the Captain and Flynn as the deckhand. Both were super professional and helpful out on the boat. The majority of my fishing has been done in the Bay Area and with the smaller boat you were able to get more personalized attention, which I thought was nice. They were great about coaching me along on some techniques and I was able to reel in two nice sized halibut.

Overall I'd recommend Afishhunt to both stay at and charter fish from. They provide a professional service that is an enjoyable experience. And what I personally enjoyed about staying in Ninilchik over Homer was that it seems like you have a little bit more of an authentic Alaskan experience. Homer seemed a little ""touristy"" whereas Ninilchik was just this nice little village. I'd also recommend hitting up the coffee shop across the street when you get up in the morning."
5573,"Bulk buying at its finest, awe good ole Costco. If you haven't signed up for you executive membership ship yet I'd highly recommend it. The refund checks are amazing almost paid for 2 months of food just by getting the normal stuff all year. They have a massive meat selection and fun things to try from all over. They keep some of the best produce in town and save bundles on fuel. Which again get that good membership and you can use your rewards for gas. It's truly amazing."
5574,Decent park for kite flying on the hill and seems relatively safe due to to decent neighborhood.
5575,Great produce and meat
5576,Love it. The people are so nice there
5577,"Not much here other than some camp spots and a sign, but still a must stop location along the Dalton"
5578,"Fixed me right up. I thought it was one thing, they said it sounded like another. They took care of the problem for a great price"
5579,They were great.  Answered all questions to my satisfaction.  Bought a twin mattress set with base and 2 sheet sets.   Might as well buy a cooling pillow while there.  I'm excited that they deliver also.
5580,"(Translated by Google) I just came in and I was pretty

(Original)
Solo entre y estaba bonita"
5581,Excellent food and service
5582,"The best smothered steak I have ever had. Great atmosphere, excellent food"
5583,There's nothing I love more than learning more and more about mushing.
5584,Amazing experience
5585,"Great job on the car wash where there's a staff tech there to manually pre-wash the post-winter grime.  My only gripe is that I didn't see any machines for chamois or drying rags that took credit/debit.  I may have just overlooked them, but I walked around a couple minutes looking like a doofus and then gave up and ""air dried"" my truck with a slow drive to Kincaid."
5586,"I had to come into Anchorage and cannot drive at night. It was my first foray in about six months and I came with the knowledge that there would be requirements for covid. I decided to stay at the Captain Cook because of its location and because it advertised a pool. When I get there, it's $140 for a small room with no pool. I probably could have gone somewhere else but I didn't want to have to try and find something.

I get to the room and the cleaning staff must have forgotten their gear when they left because there was cleaning supplies, restocking supplies,and a case of bottled water. For $140 a night, I would ""expect"" a little better. Room was ok; it served its purpose of somewhere to sleep so I didn't have to drive home in the dark but definitely NOT worth it."
5587,Food is ok at best... but the drinks are amazing !
5588,Very disappointed with this place.  We waited months for our schedules to sync up only to be disappointed in the food and our waiter.
5589,Good food but also a great place to meet up for drinks. #italianmargarita
5590,"Last couple of times I've been there they've taken their sweet 'ol time at gettin' the job done, but they've usually gotten it done right and for a fair price. Would probably get the job done quicker if they hired at least a couple more people and had at least one more person in the office behind the counter to help process paperwork, etc..."

5593,Great people
5594,Safe and it's Home
5595,"I love the burgers at this little restaurant. The owner tells me he uses ground beef and pats them out by hand, not frozen patties. French fries are like good old fashioned  drugstore fries. Asian food is good, too, but try their burgers!"
5596,It's a nicer version of Wal Mart. I like it.
5597,Always love homedepot
5598,The food and ambiance were both very nice. I will definitely go back again.
5599,The employees at this tesoro location are awesome!
5600,"Great burger, friendly waiter."
5601,Way too expensive for used items.
5602,"Great quality gear for reasonable prices, and amazing knowledgeable and friendly staff!"

5604,Usually good during rush hour
5605,Nice large warehouse garden supply with attention to CBD products and your own grow.
5606,Always great food at pagoda
5607,Great place & u dont spend nearly as much there
5608,"Glad to see the water bottle filling stations. Very easy Covid testing set-up here. They're available 24 hrs so that's good to remember. Its bound to be cheaper at home before you travel but this was smooth and hassle-free. Don't worry! You swab your own nose under guidance, nobody is poking you or touching you anywhere."
5609,"This is a gem of Fairbanks. It is more up my wife's alley, but they had such an eclectic collection of artisan notebooks, candles, greeting cards, et cetera -- it was just fun to browse and shop for gifts, especially. We were happy with our purchases and will certainly go back."
5610,"Awesome experience, very clean, and professional. Thank you for everything"
5611,"Great service, friendly employees. Always clean and the food comes quickly."
5612,Why close to town.  But it's close to town!!
5613,Quality vape stuffs
5614,I found the things I was looking for. There things seem to be a little more pricer than JoAnn's but nothing is free.
5615,"It was delicious; and just a pastrami sandwich at that. I love the tucked in diner feel, cozy against a mountain ski resort. Even with slightly broken English, the discussion they had with a customer wanting to bring 30 kids in was amazing and extremely helpful.
Also, the endless soup bowls are perfect for a chilly but sunny day in the outdoor seating area."
5616,This was the cleanest Golden Corral I have ever been to.
5617,"It's Taco Bell, you probably know what you're in for. The staff are good at keeping up with rushes and handling complicated orders here though!"
5618,Lots of dogs!
5619,Excellent
5620,"Staff are push at times and argumentative. At times it's hard for them to find the right part even with a ""to go by"" - got to fats instead"
5621,Incredible edibles... Fun staff!
5622,"Good food every time, love love love musubi and chicken katsu!!"
5623,"Good prices, good selection of products. Fast shopping."
5624,Drive thru
5625,Good
5626,"I looked high and low for a catering service for a wedding. Checked almost every place in Anchorage. Calls and emails where not returned. Prices where crazy high.. No body really seemed interested until I approached these folks at Golden Corral.
They bent over backwards to supply a diverse menu with dietary restrictions the day before the busiest in there year.
We fed over 150 people some great food and still had food left over to give to Brother Francis. The cost was a third of the lowest bid we had from any other catering service.
The prices were great, the food ready on time and the 3 managers we worked with were a delight.  I highly recommend considering this place for your catering."
5627,"(Translated by Google) One more shopping.

(Original)
Un shopping más."
5628,"At this location, I hate the veggies. I'm not sure if this is the location that only gets ugly shriveled vegetables but that's what I saw when I was there. Other than that it's okay."
5629,Cheap food an it taste like cheap food .
5630,Worth stopping. Very nice all the Animals were out and active.
5631,Ben Kuhn is the best.  All of our menagerie is seen here.
5632,The resort is ok. Come for the hotsprings. I would not recommend staying a night here.
5633,The service was good and the food was very good.

Hermoso el reloj con la musica...me encanto!"
5635,Great place just to let the dog run and kiddos to play. Not a lot of people some days
5636,Consistent goodness
5637,Good breakfast sandwich
5638,Schezwan beef tasted like bland sweet and sour. ...no spice to it. Sesame chicken tasted like sweet and sour with sesame seeds on top. I will not be back
5639,Horrible I waited two hours to pick up my appliances. NO ONE HELPED ME THEY JUST IGNORED ME
5640,Lots of homeless people/crime
5641,Great
5642,"There is so much to do here. Lazer tag, spinning bumper cars, go kart racing, rock wall climbing, a soft play place for kids, arcade games, great prize selection, food. Just so much to do and so much fun for the entire family."
5643,Speedy and Friendly
5644,Warm awesome people service my sister was nice bought me sandwich .thanks to nice staff great meal

5649,Exellent
5650,Great car wash. Reasonable prices and availability.
5651,Best place to get stuff for your pet
5652,It was pretty good. I enjoyed this Mexican restaurant. They have a wealth of options to choose from. Even a healthy menu option which is rare these days in Mexican restaurants. Good cocktails too.
5653,The build your own pasta is always my go-to!
5654,Meh. It's a hipster place and the food is inconsistent.  I go every few months and it's good about 2 of 3 trips.
5655,"Best food North Pole has to offer! People are always friendly, place is always clean, and the food is ALWAYS AMAZING! This establishment truly deserves more than 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

5661,Good selection
5662,"Pizza is very good, and sell by the slice"
5663,Best Sammie's in town
5664,Good food at reasonable prices. The waitress was very attentive and the full house shows how popular this place is. You won't be dissapointed.
5665,"Enjoyed eating there, friendly staff and good food. Ordered the new prime steak hoagie melt. Quite delicious."
5666,Always have a great experience with this dominoes. I have ordered from other pizza places and they are so rude and disrespectful. But this dominoes is now my go to place. Thank you to all the awesome people who work here. You all rock!!!
5667,BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD
5668,"This Burlington may be older and more cramped than the newer one, but it's got the better selection."
5669,Who doesn't love taco bell💞
5670,"Very good latte, similar to major national coffee chains.  We drank at a smaller shop on south Franklin, not the big one further northwest.  Service was so-so - barista on phone complaining to co-worker about bad working conditions..."
5671,Tariq makes the best Middle Eastern food in town hands down
5672,Love Petco always great deals!
5673,Nice
5674,"I bought an Alaska Land 4 Life patch at this place. Total next level, way to support what never should have changed! Oh yeah, killer coffee, great atmosphere, I try to stop in when downtown."
5675,One of the most amazing outdoors stores i have ever been to.  Very knowledgeable staff full of helpful advice.
5676,"Really amazing desserts. Had a sausage breakfast sandwich, wasn't entirely in love, but my friend thought it was amazing. The carrot cake and fresh berry trifle was to die for though. I also bought a banana rum cupcake, which I gave to a friend as a gift. I would go back for it though because it still looked amazing."
5677,Awesome steak and eggs for breakfast. Very clean eating place.  Staff was very nice.  Restrooms very clean.  Everything tasted great.
5678,"Great service, thx guys!"
5679,"Friendly staff who are knowledgeable about whatever you'll need for boardgames, comics, card games, etc. Store holds a wide selection of items."
5680,My wife and I came in for a consultation and they handled the situation very professionally. We met with the lawyer who gave us honest advice that didn't steer us into litigation for their benefit. His advice showed a solid grasp of situations like the one we experienced and he freely provided information. I thought that after leaving I would reach out to them first on any other matters in which we might need a lawyer based on how he handled our situation.
5681,Best price in town
5682,"What a beautiful paved path park! Paved pathways go throughout but off path trails are also throughout the park. It's neat to read the informational sign posts about the earthquake of '64. We we're hoping there would be a grassy open area to picnic but the most we found were benches, which had a fantastic view. Also, make sure you use a bathroom before you go! No toilets or port a potties that we saw."
5683,Good family breakfast place
5684,Good store and help. Not as much selection as Cabelas for most things
5685,The best place we have stopped for food.  Everything we ordered was quality.
5686,I go there every chance I get
5687,Great hair cuts awsome staff.
5688,"Average at best. Staff was attentive and efficient, but I ordered Menudo and it was missing the Hominey. One of the main incredients. Margaritas were ok and nothing to write home about. It was a very nice portion of soup I will say that."
5689,Placed order online. Next day delivery was available. My friend sent a picture saying thank you and the arrangement looked just like the website advertised. So happy with the product and ease of ordering.
5690,Place is awesome!! Brought my 6 and 8 year old girls and they were so excited. The ride takes you through different terrain which to me was the best part. Price was reasonable and well worth it.
5691,Good prices and helpful staff.
5692,"I love the produce here, and all the things that i can't find anywhere else in town."
5693,Beautiful rooms at the rivers edge excellent service. They go the extra mile to make sure you have a great vacation. They make the major chains look bad.
5694,"As with any Vietnamese restaurant, you are seated immediately upon arrival.  The green tea is good.  Our soups were out in just a few short minutes.  A healthy portion of beef tendon was the highlight of the soup.  The broth is decent as well. I will probably be back, but not after exploring the numerous other locations for Pho in Anchorage."
5695,It is the only Tire company I go too. There are honest and good people there.  The owners Dave and Judy are wonderful people's to do business with.  I have been going there for 19 years.
5696,The food has always been delicious.  Service is always on point.  Friendly people and good cocktails.  I'll always go back.
5697,Great family run shop
5698,Friendly staff and very knowledgeable
5699,Prices are a bit high but the staff is great!
5700,"Amazing mom and pop type diner. They are a cash only, tiny and cozy, rustic-esque breakfast gem. I haven't even tried anything else besides breakfast in the 3 years I've visited, but I'm sure it's not bad.

I'm from North Carolina, and they have grits y'all. :) Not runny OR undercooked, it's a southern miracle in an artic wonderland."
5701,Delicious sushi 🍣
5702,Great almost virgin land. Chances to see wildlife close to town.
5703,Easy and they always have good prices and good gas.
5704,"Very pleasant atmosphere, nice staff, great portions and delicious food!  We very much enjoyed our time in Brewster's!"
5705,"Can be very difficult when you're not used to using your brain in this manner.The easiest  room has a 40% success rate ,good luck."
5706,"Our first time to visit this place. This place was amazing to stay in if you're using your 5th wheel ,Trailer or RV's its very spacious and privacy to each camper's. The owner was helpful and their office was nice all though not much gifts,but the main thing for the visit is the mountains, Trees and Gods creations.   Come and visit this place you won't regret it. Wonderful owners! Thank you will be back next time God bless everyone."
5707,"Their malts are excellent, soup &sandwiches adequate."
5708,Great
5709,Always great food and service.
5710,"Staff are kind enough to do things, however seeing dead fish in the filter makes me slightly mad. I saw two dead fish in one of the tanks however they usually take care of it faster than Walmart did. It is a good place though."
5711,"The crust was good, thin and crispy, but the sauce was super thin and not very flavorful. The mozzarella sticks were tiny, the marinara was like mild salsa, just super super thin."
5712,"Dr. Bilan is excellent! His staff are kind, caring, knowledgable and professional. I love the warm greeting by the sweet golden retrievers that chill in the lobby. Without a doubt, Dr. Bilan's treatments have changed my life!"
5713,Do it yourself they are proud of their prices..
5714,We were treated very awesome. The lady knew her product and was quick to help.
5715,GROWLER BAR WITH ALL YOUR ALASKAN FAVES ON TAP.
5716,"Great variety,good pricing. Staff very knowledgeable. I highly recommend them."
5717,"Nice playground. Well kept. But, restrooms were closed at 3pm on a Saturday. ""Closed for the winter"" which is difficult for children who have to go and are potty training. It would be nice to have the restrooms open where there are special events going on downtown (Fall Festival at the Museum)"
5718,"OUTSTANDING service, food was EXCELLENT, and the brews.  So many great brews to cost from."
5719,"The food at this downtown eatery is interesting and looks beautiful. Lots of options on the menu with  plenty of things you could share -- great for communal eaters like our crew. Our tostones were a  little tough and not very flavorful. Drive in burger + fries, chicken adobo, and the Caesar were all good. We'll return to try other things on the menu."
5720,"They have an awesome variety of toys, treats and leashes and harnesses. Way better options than other pet stores."
5721,Great finds for the craters and coupon savings
5722,"Amazing staff, Amazing owner, and THE best ice cream in town."
5723,The kids pool is Sooooo warm.

5727,Corporate's decision to be against NRA has permanently changed how I view this company.
5728,We were so rudely rushed out by the attendant because he kept repeating its a busy day. So we didnt get to dry our car.
5729,"Great  service, very polite and professional. I would recommend them to all that want a great carpet cleaning at a fair price."
5730,Good food. Good service. Their thai tea was the best i have had in a long time.I would strongly recommend
5731,This is a really cool museum with tons of history and science information.  Make sure to see a Ketchikan Story or other movie.  Admission is free for those with annual park passes.
5732,Eat fresh! Even in Juneau!
5733,Good quality sandwiches at good prices.
5734,Amazing as usual!
5735,Food is delicious and service is excellent!
5736,Great food with even better service. Feom start to finish we were catered to and made to feel welcome. The food was amazing and they weren't stingy with the side dishes. We used to go to Home Town Resturaunt but the service was poor. We're glad we found this place and we look forward to coming back!
5737,"Not sure if it was the female stylist was new or the fact they aren't very good at fine hair, but my 11 yo son walked out with a Hack Job, which I didn't notice because they styled it with pomade. I give a great tip, as I mostly always do. I was furious the next day when his hair was washed and I could see crazy different lengths of hair... a mess!"
5738,"Excellent food, excellent people, I was a little weary at first, but it's great!"
5739,Was so yummy I loved the food

No wait time.. so if you are in a hurry this is the place to go and grab delicious breakfast and coffee!"

5745,"Ok, it's McDonald's"
5746,"Yummo, yummy yum yum yummity yummy yummity yummy yum yummy yum yum yum yummiest Asian food in town, good prices too."
5747,They usually have a fair supply of weather appropriate clothing. However prices are fairly high considering the items are donated. Seniors over 55 get a 30% discount on Tuesday.
5748,Can always depend on the service and quality to be great.
5749,Very polite workers always fast service. The benefits i get with banking here are worth it. I  love how clean the place is. The hours of business is better and longer hours compared to ANY other bank. I have gotten my credit up through them. And the online banking is user friendly.
5750,"Really good! Not the best soft serve I've had, but it's good enough! They have many options to choose from. Their prices are steep. Staff are friendly."
5751,The best Donuts in Fairbanks! 🍩
5752,"As always, Benihana comes though with quality service, friendly staff and delicious food. Everyone had such an amazing time. Several in our group had never been to this type of establishment and the smiles on their faces would have made any price worth it. Great job tonight and thanks again for the great memories!!!"
5753,"Awesome time yet again!!! Few of the games took money and didnt start, had to ask for employees help but other than that it was a blast. 3.5 hours of wearing out the littles on our cold AK day 🤪"
5754,Their  food is always dry
5755,"This location was alright, service was somewhat prompt but some employee's were very condisending in the interactions with some of their customers"
5756,Great view of the cook inlet.
5757,"Great service, friendly communicative staff, awesome service report complete with photos of all work performed!"
5758,Love the 50% off food items.
5759,"Best Car shopping experience Ever!!!
We entered the lot, knew which car we wanted by their website. Solat got the keys for us. Took a test drive. Did the paperwork and was done 2 and half hours later. Best experience ever."
5760,Stunning and fascinating.
5761,Salmon fishing was ok.
5762,"This store is great! The staff is friendly and helpful. I shop here frequently. There is a Starbucks, Liquor store, Alaska USA Credit Union inside the store. GCI and Great Clips are at the same location. This store also sells gas, diesel and propane at the service station."
5763,Their menu is good and I like their burgers but they only have for dipping sauces for their chicken. And not one place in all of Anchorage has your ice cream in a cone. You have to get it in a paper cup
5764,"One of our go-to trails. Easy and enjoyable to do. I like the forest by the lakeside feel. Also, nice little drive to get away from Anchorage. Last time we went, it started to drizzle to outright rain heavily. It was still fun and refreshing,  and kept the bug count down."
5765,Has what I need
5766,Was surprised to find this store in Wasilla :)
5767,"Friendly staff,good sandwiches"
5768,Delicious ice cream. Especially the mint chocolate chip.
5769,It was more like a gathering with the VA members and their families .There were some games and misic but most of all the food was awesome. I thank those who were providing everything and I enjoyed it .
5770,Relaxing trip from Anchorage to Seward ! Great senary!
5771,"It seems like it's a nice spot to eat. Unfortunately there were a few things that made it kind of something you won't go back again for. The menu is huge and overwhelming. The staff was great but we really felt bad having to ask for more time to look through the menu, and both my partner and I finally just panicked and picked the one thing that stuck out to us that was familiar. We got the pad thai. It was alright. I was kind of disappointed that it seemed wet or soggy. The bean sprouts were wilted in with the dish. It came with a quarter slice of lime which isn't really enough. The chicken had a weird off taste to it...it might have been on the edge of off. It would have been great if the sprouts, lime wedge, and maybe some cilantro had been served on the side so you could mix them in and get that really nice fresh cool crunch with the noodles. It seemed a bit greasy too. We got the cucumber salad and it was like eating butter bread pickles and not at all what we expected. Extremely, overwhelmingly sweet. Not something we're used to at a Thai style restaurant. Unfortunately nothing really noteworthy. Just kind of bland and a bit off."
5772,Great food
5773,Great breakfast.  Excellent food and superb service.  A must go to place.
5774,15% of your order for a delivery is outrageous. If you don't want to deliver don't offer it.
5775,Very professional help. Emptied out my 10x10 storage unit and brought everything up a flight of stairs. Very much appreciated!
5776,Good customer service
5777,Good service and friendly staff! I Like Subway!
5778,"Rather expensive, but the cost makes a bit of sense when you consider all the berries and fruits they must go through. Taste is delicious."
5779,"Has a little bit of everything for your shopping, day/out needs."
5780,I usually leave with something I need or want and other times they're out of stock of almost everything. So it's about a 50-50 % chance of getting what you want but the prices are worth it. But if you can't find anything there's a fred Meyers right behind Walmart.
5781,"Monday July 23 was my birthday and Mom and I stopped in for lunch.  We had the best halibut burger in the world. Lightly fried,  not greasy and the fish was bigger than the bun. Had good fries too!  Couldn't eat them all but we did eat all the fish. Waitress gave us the best  brownies my b-day.  It was so moist and fudggie wished we had more. Next time in Anchorage we'll be heading back to the corner of 4th and A st. For a halibut burger at the White Spot Cafe!    Two happy Texans"
5782,Variety of groceries and clothes and reasonably priced!
5783,Great friendly wait staff serving a good beer
5784,Customer service here is top notch. Amazing attention to detail throughout the entire process. The Dr. spent the time explaining every detail of the procedure my dog was going to have... in minute detail! I've never had a Dr spend that much time with me. Should be held as the standard bearer!
5785,The worst. Everybody just graduated beauty school yesterday
5786,"NEVER DISAPPOINTED by their always changing flavors!!! Its a must try. Sometimes there is a line out of the door and it's a tiny shop, but worth the wait."
5787,"Great view, very quiet, and good place for a little off-roading. Plus wind turbines are cool."
5788,Almost everything you will need
5789,"This is the place for every vitamin, supplement, health food, essential oil, and organic beauty product you can imagine. Its pricey but all nutrition shops are. They've even got yoga supplies. Our island is lucky to have a dedicated nutrition store like this."
5790,"What could be more charming than visiting St. Nick and his wife at North Pole, Alaska. When Santa is not busy having photos with the children, he loves to chat a while. The store has all kinds of Xmas ornaments, gifts, and Christmas-oriented merchandise. They will also send personalized letters from Santa to your friends. Be sure to sample the fudge in flavors like Peppermint bark and Candy cane."
5791,My family and I have had good experiences with animal control. They provide great services!
5792,Nice guys and cheap 1/8ths
5793,"Foods ok,  service is lacking, pricey"
5794,good bbq
5795,A little expensive for the quality of food
5796,Really awesome pizza!  I ordered 4 larges and that was filling enough for 10 people.  It was soft but not mush and they use real cheese on it.  So far the best one ive had since being out here!
5797,Clean rooms very comfortable
5798,Quick service easy to work with for swapping tires.  Very knowledgeable also.
5799,Fast fresh and good
5800,Great place to find what your looking for.
5801,Great place.
5802,Really nice place with great sights
5803,"Service was not very good, food was mediocre. This city has to many good options go try something local, you won’t regret it!"
5804,Love the kebobs
5805,They close the kitchen down an hour before closing. FYI
5806,"Great Burgers, the shakes are really good as well. Delivery Drivers are always super cool. The only place i get me burgers."
5807,One of our favorite spots in Seward for a cup of coffee or tea. Lots of character and art.

5809,The food was very good and a lot of parking
5810,Safeway has a new and improved section of frozen gluten free cakes and desserts.
5811,Best cinnamon rolls ever
5812,Always a good experience
5813,Outstanding selection.
5814,great coffee every time
5815,If you are looking for 1950s downtown Anchorage Alaska. You've found it. This is a 21 and older establishment and all kids must be accompanied by an adult. The food is steak and potatoes but because we are in Alaska the have the great seafood staples. This is a place not to be missed if you are a local or just in town for business. There is a bar with a TV for sports or whatever. The Olympics is on currently.
5816,Cute stuff and reasonable prices
5817,"First time here and we loved it. The atmosphere, staff, and food were all great."
5818,"Great food, drinks and food!"
5819,All the basics.
5820,I was able to switch out most of my acrylic paints.But the shelves were bare from Christmas. I was hoping to be able to get some new colors but that didn't work out.
5821,"Food came a little cold, delivery was fast, fries tasted like they were fried in some type of seafood oil like they didn’t change the oil or something but they were perfectly crispy and the Mac salad wasn’t mixed well. Overall it could have been better."
5822,"Brand new facility. Beds are comfy af. Lobby is spacious and welcoming. Included bfast was basic but well presented and tasty. Has a pool, only one in town. A step or two above anything else in Valdez."
5823,Classic
5824,Quick in and out with what we wanted.
5825,"Coffee and great service, what more?!"
5826,The most consistent Mexican food in Fairbanks. The lingua full of flavor and I make nachos villasana when I go in. I take one of there containers to go put three scoops of green salsa two scoops of pico de gallo and one scoop of each of the other salsa. Stir it up and you have a funominal  salsa for chips or to put on all your food. Thank you Taco King.
5827,Hood food and great atmosphere!
5828,I think its definitely for a crowd in their 30's and younger. No place to sit. I went and sat in the elevator waiting seats and chatted with my friends. It was a nice change of routine and should be checked out. The arcade games were blinking making noises and being awesome.
5829,"Nice little cozy, friendly mom n pops style breakfast joint. Live music topped it off this Sunday. Definitely recommend."
5830,"A wonderful place to hike, bike and cross-ski in any season. I go there often."
5831,"Newly remodeled, a great feast for lunch or dinner. All your favorites to include vegetarian!"
5832,It is the dank yeah
5833,I love walking on the beach
5834,"Decent

5836,"I cannot describe how frustrated I am with this business. I took a ring to get sized from a size 7 to a size 6. Simple enough right....NOT!

I took my ring in on November 2nd, I was told it would be ready in 7 days. ""GREAT!"" I thought.

One week later on November 9th I was in the mall picking something else up so I decided to stop in to see if it was ready.  The Gentleman at the counter took my ticket and spent 7 minutes looking for my order.  That by itself is kind of nerve-racking.  He finally found it and came back and said. The ring material is actually platinum not silver so instead of being $45 it would be $95. So therefore the ring was not ready yet. OK money was not the problem. He then began to tell us that the stones were actually CZ not diamonds like we had paid  for when we bought the ring. *Note: we did not purchase the ring from them.* Since we had paid for diamond and not CZ we told him we would just return the ring to where we got it and just order something different.  He said not a problem we would be refunded the $45 we paid to have it sized. He said the ring was at their Eagle River shop and it would be back sometime during the week and they would call when they got it in.

The next week no phone call....

November 26 with still no phone call, we decided to call. No one answered the phone until 2pm. The gentleman who answered the phone couldn't find our ticket once again.  He said he would call me back within 15 minutes.

2 hours later....I get a call. He has my ring but says I don't know if it's done yet.....WTF??? Are you kidding me???? I explain to him nothing was suppose to be done to it. I said I would be there after work to pick it up.

We get to the store and the gentleman at the counter brings me my ring....

IT HAD BEEN SIZED!!!!

There are gashes all over this ring and burn marks. I told the man at the counter they weren't suppose to size it. And he smugly replies it says on your ticket that it needs to be sized. I went over again what was suppose to happen again with him. He replies, ""Oh, well they were probably already working on it when you came in to ask for it back."" we tell him we didn't want it sized because we were told there were CZ stones not diamonds. He said "" oh, they are absolutely real diamonds"" WHICH IS IT????

When I got home with the ring that night I realized a diamond or CZ whichever, was missing. I have been trying to call them ever since but no one answers and their voice mail is full.

This is a piss poor excuse for a business. Now I am stuck with a ring that has a stone missing, with gashes and burn marks, that might be real or it might be fake.  These folks are not jewelers!"
5837,"No complaints whatsoever. They came recommended from another company, didn't jerk me around. They were transparent, clear, and honest.  Got my quote, got my rig in, they did exactly what they said, and charged for exactly what they did.  No mystery in any step.
First time I needed a shop for something I didn't have and honestly would do it again."
5838,"Right now, it's flat after show collapsed the roof. It's unusable and it's future is uncertain."
5839,Make sure you call the manager from your own phone for gun purchases....
5840,Great staff. Good coffee selection.
5841,"We went as a group and sampled each other's items so I got to try a fair selection. Had 3 different sushi rolls (all were fantastic examples of their types), had sesame chicken (a little sweet for my taste, but it was the best sesame chicken I've had), and panang chicken curry (the best of our sampling... Very much recommend).
One star knocked off due to I felt the prices were slightly high. In all fairness though, I am rather cheap."
5842,Great family trip.
5843,Great shoes just not in my size:(
5844,Tinker's has friendly staff and good food. They're good about making an order just how you want it.
5845,Knowledgeable staff
5846,Just another big chain store. It probably has what you need but help is limited. The last time I was in the dimensional lumber saw was out of order.
5847,"A classic style hotel. Old but well maintained, small bar/restaurant at the lobby free airport / hotel shuttle. Hotel have a breakfast, also the staff is friendly but some times it seem like they are so stressed that customer service disappear. Maybe management can improve this. Since there is always room for improvement. Remember this is a 3 star hotel."
5848,"Beer was mostly good, sadly Covid makes the atmosphere hard. Nice garden area."
5849,Small. Clean and well maintained.  Many tent spots.
5850,"Super helpful, was very polite on the phone and when I showed up in person to give the keys to have my vehicle towed they gave me the same price as quoted, very friendly and fast service will be a forever customer for sure"
5851,"Wow great burgers, fries and shakes. Family owned and super friendly staff. They really care and it shows in their service."
5852,"Bit of a wait for the showers, but clean facilities, polite staff, warm towel rental. Much needed respite after several days of fishing and tent camping."
5853,Convenient hours and located every where
5854,"It was an exciting feeling to cross the arctic circle after a long drive on the Dalton Highway. Our guide, through the Northern Alaska Tour Company, was very good; Wes. He helped us take photos, provided bug spray, binoculars and made the long trip pleasant. He helped us to see the Tundra permafrost, and even served us ""Tundra Mud"" (see photo)."
5855,Good fish and chips. Fresh fish and fresh cut fries.
5856,I have been eating here for years I would recamended this place to everyone.
5857,Just excellent! I love that suite 100's staff can seem to keep their stuff together despite PFD Friday rush. We came in for a reservation (which I'd always recommend) and was promptly seated within a couple minutes despite a full house. Our server Nick T was spot on. Quick to suggest a good choice and very genuine. We got the mushrooms and tuna poke for aps with the pawn/scallop dish and spinach cheese ravioli - everything was delish as always. The prices are reasonable and I always have spectacular service. I highly recommend Suite 100 for a romantic dinner or a group dinner to start the night!
5858,"Service can be a bit slow at  busy times,  but the subs are GREAT!"
5859,"Decent food, dessert and salad bar. Good price per person, worth the money for sure. Can become crowded fast though."
5860,"Cooked right there in front of you. Just have some time, place isn't quick. Definitely a event of a dinner."
5861,Amazing breakfast
5862,"Trendy, busy, great atmosphere. Great place. Want a change, or want a little color. No comparison."
5863,So thrilled Pat and Bill are back in business!!
5864,Beautiful view but dont let the wind push  you over
5865,"Service was very slow, and I was not a fan of the sandwich style."
5866,Free stand up comedy on Sunday and Wednesday nights.
5867,Gorgeous Alaska Winter scenery. Fantastic!
5868,Cozy
5869,"Would've been 5 stars.. had a great experience there, except when some women at the other end of the bowling place started complaining about the kids when the kids weren't a problem to them at all.. 🙄 some people just dont understand that kids are just kids"
5870,"Delightful food, nice decor. Viper roll and gyoza are outstanding. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating is its location within the Econo lodge and some of the characters that hang out in the back parking lot."
5871,"Absolutely amazing work! I brought my 3 year old 140lbs Great Pyrenees mix to Natural Pet and I have never seen his coat look and feel so luxurious, smooth, and soft. He was so happy and spoiled by end of visit. And they're affordable!We'll be back every 6 months or sooner."
5872,Loved visiting my friend works there!
5873,Fast great food and wonderful service
5874,The  service is terrific!
5875,Very nice people that work here.
5876,Clean nice hotel with easy access to ANMC! Good free breakfast
5877,Love this place. They are always so nice and the food is my favorite Chinese take out in Salt Lake. I love the Lo Mein!
5878,Yum!
5879,"Delicious food, excellent wine selection and service."
5880,Great bar. Packed on weekends.
5881,Crouded
5882,"My beer never came, we had to ask for it several times. The place was not full. Awful service"
5883,Really good food!
5884,Stuff you need is here
5885,Employees don't seem as friendly as other stores.
5886,"Lived here before it was built, cleaned it up"
5887,"Some people wanted to leave early, so we didn't get to spend the whole time there that we paid for. The northern lights were awesome!"
5888,rustic restaurant in an Alaskan fishing town. I had a pulled pork sandwich topped with coleslaw. Good locally brewed beers. just the way I like it! beautiful mountain views. friendly service.
5889,"Good product and decent prices, their Burrito is an awesome, quick lunch"
5890,Great food and service
5891,The management on Saturday June 27 didn't want to open up another locker room with 10-11 players. Under normal circumstances I would not care but in light of the current Covid-19 situation I find it quite irresponsible for the safety of the players. So I won't be patronizing them anymore on the weekends for adult hockey unless their policy and behavior changes. Not a good look at all! There are 4 locker rooms on the blue side and they want all of us stuffed in 1 room.
5892,"Lots of room to spread out, Great playground and best of all, a fenced in area where your dogs can run and play."
5893,Practically authentic food.
5894,"Val is a nice and intelligent lady, you won't be disappointed :)"
5895,"This is my go to Sushi place. Try the scallops, the squid, or the mussel shooters for a treat."
5896,It's awesome for what it is. I'm just glad that we have a day old bread store up here. Also can't beat the coffee that only cost $4 a pound.
5897,Service was great! Fast and friendly. Food was pretty good. Not the best red robin I have had but it was good.
5898,Had a coupon.  Was told it will be accepted. Then when I checked in was told. Present it the next morning on check out.  Refuse to accept it. So not a good place to stay
5899,The bartender was hard of hearing.. Had to basically yell for her to take our order
5900,Each time I go there I missing food
5901,They were out of chicken. Chicken!!!
5902,Good food. Nice atmosphere. Fireplaces. I love the schnitzel.
5903,Best mexican food we've had in a long while. Thanks!

5918,It was fun. Highly recommend
5919,Huge selection
5920,"Keep in mind, this is a busy holiday weekend post Covid lockdown so may not be the usual experience. Seafood shower was not edible. I was starving so I really tried to like it but couldn’t. It was very lemony and not creamy at all. It had a lot of salmon chunks but no other types of seafood that I could taste and no potato or other veggies for a texture contrast. It wasn’t creamy either. The cod sandwich was good but fries were cold. Husband ordered the bacon cheese burger and it had bacon bits on it. Not strips of bacon like a normal bacon cheeseburger. It also took a while to get the food which you pickup from a counter. Also, my soup didn’t come out first like is standard at most restaurants. Ambiance is nice, right by the harbor. That’s why I am giving 3 stars instead of 2."
5921,"It’s a nice place to go for a drink, and food, a lot of interesting stuff to check out and look at. Floor is covered in sawdust"
5922,I was very impressed with how fresh my salad was in January (a month not really known for it's fresh produce)
5923,"What a great place to visit in Girdwood.  Nice place great, pool table and jukebox."
5924,short hike about a mile-ish to a beautiful ice cave. be cautious.
5925,Shopping convenience
5926,Did an awesome job fixing my jeep
5927,"Awesome, recommended stop! Large portions served!"
5928,Fine  dining. Lovely atmosphere. Good food.
5929,"Not exactly a heavy crafter, however selection & sales typically you're better off @ Joanne's near IHOP."
5930,So good. They still have incharitos. Who yeah
5931,"Sucks on holidays and weekends.Bad cashiers and even worse lines,but still a good place to shop"
5932,Good food
5933,Easy and find things
5934,Food is great you pay what you get so good
5935,Always friendly

5938,Great place.
5939,Great location next to the 5th ave mall
5940,"Nice, small port. Limited activities for smaller children."
5941,Always friendly and delicious food. Try the brisket or pork burrito alongside a margarita.
5942,Showers are almost always cold.
5943,Yummy filling food
5944,"It's a recovery church. He does not stick behind those who stick behind them. Has two sides and if you are of no use to him. You get one side. If he can get something from you, he will promise you the after life. Unless you pocket book runs dry."
5945,Perfect one stop shop just before the resort
5946,Great Alaskan beer selection on draft. Friendly staff and clientele. Great little dive bar
5947,Big
5948,Excellent food and service
5949,"A little slow on service. Food and beverage choices were good. Recommend, however, plan extra time."
5950,"Nice and informative staff, excellent store for all things nerd and geek. Have been a patron of this establishment for over 20 years. Bought all of my D&D stuff there as well as a plethora of other gaming stuff."
5951,"Go see Sean for anything with your hair.
Kat for eyelashes.
There is a wait list for them, But its worth it!!"
5952,Had a battery replaced and got a bad one so they ordered another one and fixed my phone
5953,"Wow, not to be missed, monthly events and daily spectacular!"
5954,I lost
5955,A little more expensive than Freddie's but has better atmosphere
5956,"My favorite park in Anchorage. Fantastic frolf course-open year round. Great ski trails in winter, biking and running trails in summer. Good place to show tourists some moose in the summer."
5957,Great local breakfast and lunch place. There is often a wait for a table so plan ahead or sit at the bar if you come solo.
5958,Try the burgers have some beer
5959,"Always the best, make sure and check out the new cajun shrimp. Not spicy hot at all just a little kick."
5960,Luigi's Pizza has been one of my favorite pizza stopped since I was in high school there $5 take out pizza deal is out of this world make sure you call in advance so that you can just run in and grab your pizzas I haven't had any of their other food because their pizzas so delicious but I I would guess that it is also very tasty the gentleman that owns this establishment is very nice as well as his employees
5961,"Drive through still, two years later takes forever"
5962,Fast service and super friendly crew. Best burger in Anchorage.
5963,Gross
5964,Warm
5965,Was better than Wal-Mart.  They had everything you needed. Store was clean and neat.
5966,The tacos were extremely good along with the cocktails and atmosphere. I would have gladly given it a 5 stars but we came on taco Tuesday so they were half off. I do feel the food is overpriced every other day of the week. If you don't mind overpaying for tacos and cocktails then this is the place for you.
5967,Best cloths
5968,"Great big store, great big selections. I only wish there were great big sales... because I can't afford to shop here for much of anything...I just kind of browse."
5969,"(Translated by Google) The best panoramic tour by train, the landscapes are beautiful

5970,"The Bear Tooth has always been a go to place for us. The menu includes all of your favorite pizza combinations from their sister restaurant, The Moose’s Tooth, and a whole bunch more. Their nachos are delicious but bring an army to help you eat them! They have everything from salads, to wraps, to burritos. I don’t often indulge in soft drinks but it is hard not to order their home brew root beer or cream soda. The service is excellent and quick but, even though they are busy, I have never felt rushed there. While dine in is currently closed, they’ve had quite the take out set up in response to Covid. They are working hard to serve their customers and keep them safe at the same time!"
5971,Good place to look for books or music. Got some coffee from Starbucks
5972,"Awesome toy store! Lots of cool stuff I wish I had as a youngster. Seems mostly geared towards younger kids, but also has really interesting project kits."
5973,Parking................ suggestion  scan the food in trally  little ahead and give him  receipt.than he goes simply pay the cashier. This  thing make it move fast and help parking. Also staff  park far so customer can have  front space.
5974,"Traci at the phone kiosk is amazing! She will take care of you and help you through the entire phone buying process. The entire staff at this location rocks!!! I came in close to closing to pick up two phones, everyone was super helpful and just made my evening."
5975,Four stars chocolate waterfall was not working when I came in bummed out but still had fun
5976,"Prices were expected to be high, but totally flabbergasted at price / quality. They actually have a $12.50 upcharge for fried rice over white rice. Chef was friendly but far from proficient. Not a establishment I can recommend, sorry."
5977,"Great location and facility!  Unfortunately, the weather kept Denali well hidden!"
5978,"I went in there on a really hard day in between appointments, lots of stress. I was greeted by a calm, clean, comfortable waiting area and immediately acknowledged and offered cold bottled water and coffee. I was quick to be helped and the process for getting an estimate was painless. The lady at the front desk was cheerful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The man who came out to help me was just as wonderful, knew immediately how to help me, and had the patience to explain to me what they could do and what the process would entail

But that's not all. He had my car fixed ON THE SPOT. He knew what I wanted was a quick fix (I didn't know that) and even asked permission to touch my car before demonstrating for me. Within 10 minutes of talking to him, he rolled out my car ready to go. The door was fixed.

This blows my mind. I won't get into the details of cost but let me just say that it was MORE than fair. I am so overwhelmed by the kindness. The lady even offered me a water for the road. These guys have no idea... they just undid a month of stress and loss of faith. My heart is singing and I can't do enough to praise them right now. This was not a case of just excellent service. This was humanity at its best. My endless gratitude to all of your at Fairbanks Collision. Thank you."
5979,Awesome
5980,Customer service was hesitant and not the best when I asked about if there was a pick-up scheduled for my vehicle.
5981,Better than safelite
5982,"This is the only place I really trust.  I go to the counter, tell them my budget, and they usually get me good product for less."
5983,"Very interesting, answered questions about the pipeline, and provided validation the environment wasn't harmed."
5984,Average
5985,Neat store

5999,The cashier did not put my chicken sandwich in with my order.  I felt ripped off.  First I thought she did not charge me me for it. But she did.
6000,Great service
6001,Love the California omlets. French toast is great also. Friendly staff. Good prices
6002,Great food with really nice service!
6003,The spinach cheese dip is Amazing!! Fast and friendly service.

6005,"Best Hawaiian food I have had off the islands. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Anchorage. The service and staff are phenomenal. I would recommend this place to everyone who loves Hawaiian food or hasn't tried it yet. Get the poke, musubi, and laulau"
6006,"Friendly and helpful.  Its a bit more expensive than the regular DMV, but you are paying a little extra for convenience.  Usually no long lines and easy to get in and out."
6007,Great view and fresh air..
6008,Be sure to visit the Sitzmark Bar and Grill
6009,"BEST okonomiyaki I have tasted since my cousin (who learned to cook it in Japan) made it for me!! I always order this dish when I see it on a menu, and Oishi Bakery does a fabulous job. It’s got so many components: sweetness from the sauce, saltiness from the bonito & bacon, nice veggie notes from the cabbage, some savory richness from the egg, and a little pickled ginger to cut through it all, and they balance all those tastes perfectly.
We also tried two types of onigiri (especially loved the miso pork belly!) and the cheesecake soufflé, which is a slice of heaven. Imagine sitting on a cloud while wearing a big fuzzy robe and listening to a beautiful sonata and eating a cross between cheesecake and angel food cake with subtle hints of almond; that’s what eating this dessert is like.
I already can’t wait to order from Oishi Bakery again. The one challenge is that I want to try everything on the menu I haven’t sampled yet, but everything I’ve tasted was so good I’ll want to get it again!"
6010,Clean restaurant fast service enjoy the McDonald's treat when in the city.
6011,Great place. My dog loves going for checkups.

6013,I love it
6014,Familiar stuff..good service!
6015,Lovely coffee shop
6016,"Very nice place, friendly and great stuff."
6017,"This place is awesome. The puzzles aren't the kind of thing you pick up on immediately like in a lot of video games, you really have to collaborate. The best part though is the presentation! The quality of props and visuals is very impressive and it's fun as hell when the group solves a puzzle in part because of it. Definitely going to be going to every different iteration of escape room that they make"
6018,U-haul's online reservation system is a goat rope. I reserved a 10' box truck online. When I showed up to pick up the truck I was told that they had none available and my reservation had been cancelled. They called my home phone (not my preferred contact method) an hour after I showed up to tell me this. Most unimpressive.
6019,Best place to shop best return policy
6020,"Kind servers, fantastic gelato, good coffee, what more can you ask for? The affogato was quite well made, I would definitely recommend it."
6021,Great trail with varied terrain. Steep but not too steep and you can go as far as you want - 3 miles to the lake or 5 miles to south suicide.
6022,Love it!
6023,I got the chicken ranch bacon sandwich which was delicious. It satisfied hunger. The service was good and the food options were great! Nice cozy little restaurant!

6040,Food was good but the people behind the counter are not friendly. They acted agitated to have wait on people.
6041,Definitely the best pizza in town. No five stars cuz it's expensive and always very busy to the point its unpleasant a lot of times.
6042,Very helpful. Military discounts
6043,Very nice.  Beautiful landscape.
6044,The food is really good. They have weird hours and I have no idea how to deal with the half-service thing they do.

6048,"Ramen bowls are exemplary, very filling so always come with an empty stomach!"
6049,"I absolutely enjoyed the view of Seward harbor only thing I liked about hotel!!! Overpriced for view and overpriced considering Covid outbreak in Seward now!!! For a outbreak I sure didn't see any safety precautions for hotel patrons that my husband w read to me before we came from website, that there was sanitizer in room which there was none!!! Therewas to besome spread out in hotel which Isaw none, doorknobs were to have something on this g on them to ensure sanitization,  didnt see that. That guests were not be in a room within 72 hours of somebody else being out. There hotel was packed , I guess patrons safety doesn't mean anything it's all about making the money!!! I didn't see anybody going around cleaning the inside hallway  and outside hallway door handles or railings the whole time I was there, if they are to be sanitized for covid, that is not keeping anybody safe.They are to not be using luggage carts per CDC guidelines for hotels, saw everybody using them, and were they being cleaned before and after each use after people don't  know.? I saw no enforcement of only one person in electrical every time I went by more than 1 person was getting in..Right now I just don't feel safe from coronavirus staying in a hotel after this. Makes me not want to stay again in this hotel room here again or any other for awhile!!! Also ther has to be a better breakfast alternative at this hotel because of covid than what they have right now. To me this hotel is about making the money and not about the hotel patron's health right now!!w"

6056,This guy can cook! Eggs were perfect and the French toast was bomb!
6057,Best place in town to get new books. They got manga as well. Had to check out the Alita: Battle Angel series. Way more blood on the manga. Worth it to check it out if you liked the movie
6058,A good experience.   I would cut back in the butter ( I know...who says that!!)
6059,Clean rooms and a beautiful location. Can't really ask for more!

6080,Loved the bomb pizza! Delivery was quick and correct.
6081,Tastey and expensive but slow service.
6082,Decent hotel and room. Very basic. Excellent location. Close to everything. However the room we were in had no views but was clean. Has a restaurant which served good breakfast as well. Free shuttle service dropped us off and picked us up from the Rail depot.
6083,Great hike
6084,It's subway. Much better option than McDonald's
6085,The dogs were so fluffy and friendly. My brother loves dogs so he kept on petting all of them.

6103,"Breakfast was excellent, atmosphere could use some updating."
6104,Excellent clam chowder and halibut.
6105,"The crepe was huge! The roast duck was delicious! There's two different duck, roast duck and peking duck. You can get the roast duck any time but peking duck you need to order 1 day ahead. I recommend trying both! If you dine in you'll be using plastic utensils and paper plate, not a fan so next time I'll be ordering my duck to go. Service was excellent!"
6106,New seats are nice
6107,The overflow parking is ROCKING.
6108,This is one of or might be my favorite brewery in Alaska. The beer is about a 4/5 and the view is dope. The inside is equally as cool. The one down side is the food trucks that are there are not very good imo.
6109,Good selection.
6110,"Great dining experience! Reindeer steak was delicious, tender, and cooked just right. The creme brulee was light and delicious. Highly recommend for a special occasion for the price is at the higher, fine dining range. My wife and I will definitely be returning again."

6113,Lots of beer!
6114,Must see
6115,"Service was great & the cashier was very patient w/ me since I've only eaten at a smash burger once before ... food came out quickly and hot and delicious!!

My only thing is one of the cooks came out of the back with a sleeveless shirt on. I have no issue if it were the gym or 80 degrees outside. However, thats my food you're cooking and a certain level of professionalism is to be expected ... even if I was the ONLY person inside."
6116,An incredible place to stop and enjoy the magnificent views of the Turnagain Arm.
6117,"Of you're looking for a Lexus and great service, this is your place in Anchorage, AK."
6118,I had the King Crab grilled cheese with the clam chowder and it was so delicious. I was impressed by the service also they were packed for lunch so you may want to get there a tad early.
6119,Great Burgers! Their meals are generously portioned. The price is a little high but the food tastes great. The atmosphere is fun and friendly. A must stop in the Fairbanks area.
6120,"cute and quaint little shop, met and had an interview at this location for a different business. it was a nice, relaxed atmosphere to be interviewed.  I hadn't been able to get a drink or snack at that time but would like to give it a try when i am able."

6130,Skip the big shops and head over to Denali Auto Glass. can’t say enough about their efficiency and quality. Will definitely be a return customer.
6131,This is part of the Fairbaanks I formation centre. It has lots of nice native sculptures. The ladies at the help desk are very nice and super helpful.
6132,"Food was fast, I had the mushroom cheese steak. It's ok, but the processed cheese on top of the sandwich is just not doing it.... Anything besides this cheese would be awesome. It's a cheese steak, I feel like I'm eating Kraft singles on a grilled cheese."
6133,"Always friendly, good sevice ,really good food"

6138,Fast friendly service
6139,One of my favorite
6140,A newer strip mall with stores coming and going
6141,Amazing place to spend a few hours.  Very worth the entrance fee.
6142,Great food and ambiance. Small place but worth the wait
6143,Fast and easy. Price are good.

6152,Great place
6153,Great prices
6154,"The food here is pretty good, and the friendly service is extra special.  There are many cafes in Talkeetna, and we randomly took shelter from the rain and chose this one for lunch.  We enjoyed our meal and loved the ""pride of place"" everyone exuded.   Food seems to be all made from scratch in house."
6155,Just visit
6156,Helpful staff
6157,Great food and service
6158,Continously setting the industry's standards around Anchorage and beyond. Top place in town .
6159,Always there for tire change over...love it there!!!

6163,Always great food and service!
6164,Love it
6165,Great for your all-around needs. Wish they had different hours though
6166,So wild. So much to see.
6167,Best price in town on a large number of things. Esp. food
6168,"The Salmon Bake is a summer staple in Fairbanks. You basically have to go once a year. It is a bit pricey, but it is worthwhile for the food and ambience. Pick a warmer day while the sun is out so that you can truly enjoy your time there. The salmon is excellent and the beer battered cod is amazing. We tell our kids that it is chicken nuggets. They believe us and gobble them up! They do have a cheaper hot dog option for kids too if you'd rather. The sides and prime rib are good too. The dessert shack is the best. You can sip some North Pole coffee and enjoy one of two desserts. If you pace yourself, you can really leave fully stuffed and satisfied. And then walk it off over at Pioneer Park when you are done. If you are visiting Fairbanks, this should be your first dinner out. And, in my opinion, skip the crab add on. It's not worth the price."
6169,Great hike with views to die for.
6170,"Went for coffee with my bestie. Speedy service, friendly banter."
6171,Good selection of merchandise in a very wide range of selections from groceries to clothing

6180,very kool  people thanks Arctic Herbery. the root are comeing  in just  yhank you so much
6181,"Yet again I go and does not get all that I ordered. It is my job to ensure i have everything but when i tried to go back thru the drivethru, it wasnt worth the wait with kids in the car as well.  Guess I'll minimize more of my visits and be more attentive when I go to this particular location"
6182,"I've been going to Chuck E Cheese since I was a kid. I love that I have my own children to bring now and the good memories we make together. The customer service is always amazing, even when it's a full house. I think the tables could be cleaned more often, especially during the slow hours but overall I am extremely pleased and will definitely return again."
6183,"Dinner was good, smaller portion but solid flavor"
6184,"3 challenging miles, but absolutely worth it. Incredible view."
6185,Best Church in town! I love the rotation of Pastors!

6187,Great experience
6188,Great pet store
6189,"Very happy with the experience, staff was very helpful and friendly. Answered my questions and didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need or want. I would recommend White Spruce to my friends. Because they weren't pushy and listened ,answered my questions, made recommendations based on my questions and needs."
6190,"The owner was so nice to talk with. Their selections change and sell out fast so I would call first. Part of me didn't want to give a review for it's one of those things that you would love to try to keep a secret!! But he dose an awesome brew, thanks for the wonderful visit."
6191,"Bartender, Nick, was excellent. Great, quick service. Made a great recommendation for the Pepper Jam Burger - it was on point. Poured a good HooDoo for me and mixed a strong (accurate) Capt Coke. Brewster's is an amazing place that I was originally sceptical of, being that it is in the middle of tiny strip mall, but it was better than the original O'Bradys and Red Robins combined. Thank you, and see you next time I'm in town, for sure."
6192,"Always treated like family. Good food, great people! Beer selection 👍👍"
6193,"Pushy, VERY pushy sales people."
6194,So kind and professional.

6213,Place is Always Clean... Friendly...👍
6214,"These folks are amazing! Our gym needed new handles for our battle ropes and nobody else would touch them! Rob didn't hesitate! Even though the job was way out of their normal scope, he told us he'd take care of it! There's been great communication and he's paid close attention to what we needed, even ordering special materials and testing them to make sure they'd hold up through the extensive use we're going to put them through! We don't even have a boat! The best type of people work here so go! If you go somewhere else you're going to miss out!"
6215,Haven't stayed yet but hope to soon
6216,Always good coffee!
6217,"I found the prices to be super reasonable, spending a little over $40 for two people and one who drank alcohol. It looks very clean and very high quality."
6218,Went here growing up at the old location. Now with the new spot it's even better. Great people great great great climbing
6219,"My son and I really enjoyed the toddler swim lessons here. They did a great job teaching and really working with the kids, each and every one individually. Learned some great skills for both my son and myself! We will definitely be back for more later on. I have not used Buckner for anything else though."
6220,View is outstanding
6221,"Awesome sandwiches and soups with tons of options for making exactly what you want, a bit on the pricier side for a sandwich though."
6222,Alright nothing to write about.
6223,"Thank you for the help Alanna, much appreciated."
6224,"Great tour. Friendly tour guides. Amazing glacier. There is controversy associated with this business and public access, I agree with public access. But, alas this is all there is (for now) and it is worth it. It is expensive though."
6225,"Good steakhouse with good service and large portions. Can get busy on weekends and around dinner time, reservations are accepted but not required."
6226,"Great service,  management was friendly and helpful, they answered all my questions and recommended alternatives that worked better than expected."
6227,Good place
6228,They were so helpful and very nice. I normally don't shop at Carrs but I really liked this one.
6229,Everything in that store is solid klean and Orginized
6230,"The South end pulloff is wonderful place to stop and view the picturesque view of the mountain and lake.  In the stillness of early morning, the mirror reflection is too marvelous for words."

6234,Great coffee
6235,Good place to work out
6236,Good to know that the snow plows went thru before
6237,Best selection of rare rocks and stones I've seen in Anchorage. They even have giant bundles of sage!
6238,Love this place... my husband I usually get one al a cart meal and split it because it's just to much for 1...
6239,Any place that sandbags there pizza and throws them away at end of night when I see homeless and less fortunate everywhere.  Shame on them . Oh plus I dont like the plastic chez the pass off for real imitation chez.
6240,I had to search for a clerk. Then she just pointed...... poor customer service.  Thisication did not have product I was looking for.
6241,Always go there when in need of a little helping hand..... They are always very kind and patient
6242,Older mall. Yet it's very clean
6243,I love this park. It's so huge!!!
6244,Pleasantly surprised at how good the food tasted.  The halo halo was delish as well.  It was our first time going to this establishment AND we will be back. The staff was very nice and knowledgeable too.  Overall a 5 star experience.
6245,"Easy to find anything you need, friendly employees"
6246,I use to think REI was over priced and over rated. I bought some hiking shoes a couple of months ago with very light use and noticed a seam tore on the ankle of the shoes. I brought them into the store and had them swapped out for new ones in 5 minutes. You are paying for a 100% satisfaction guarantee warranty. I will be back for sure! (:
6247,"We've visited twice and both times we were there for dinner and it wasn't busy! Food tastes like any other Chinese buffet I've been to. They have a range of chinese food, fresh sushi, desserts (I've seen packages of store bought cookies), ice cream & a salad bar. They also have a choose your own lobster option."
6248,Great place to have your supplies for your projects. The associates should be better trained in knowledge of the products they sell
6249,"Nothing fancy but solid, decent food."
6250,Service was great food okay... for starting out as a wing place they have lost track of where they came from..
6251,Good drinks
6252,Clean
6253,Large portions and fast service.
6254,I like taco bell. My sisters LOVE taco bell.
6255,They are ok. Theyve been out of a paste wax paint for over a year and wont know if theyll ever get it back in stock😒
6256,Great food in tikahtnu
6257,Service and food are great. Love the view!
6258,The quality of service and food have really improved.
6259,Well maintained trails and quiet atmosphere. Beautiful scenery.
6260,Horrible
6261,"Rush, rush, rush"
6262,"Regular fries are nothing to write home about but they've got these double cheeseburger 2.99 deals that are pretty awesome considering how big and tasty the burgers are. Criss cut fries as always are delicious, a must have for any Carl's jr. Visit and, if meat isn't your thing they've also got the beyond meat burger! I cant think of another fast food place in Alaska that provides such an option. The line took kind of long to get thru, but it was friday night so I would put more weight into that being the reason, when we got to the window they had all of our food ready to go. It'd be kind of nice if they had a portable payment so they could send someone out to the cars in line, to pay, and then take the food to them as soon as it's done."
6263,"Big theaters, quick lines and good sound"
6264,the airports ok. they gave me some water when I was thirsty on thanksgiving was even better. then I saw the lady from the deadliest catch. Then the guy was about to clean the masdage chair and someone had unplugged it. On thanksgi ing one of the staff sgared their food with me.
6265,It's Walmart what more does one need to say.
6266,three stars only for our waiter food was great waiter sucked
6267,Really good deals and they support military/veteran hiring. Definitely going back
6268,Our visit tonight was amazing! Food came out stupid fast and our waitress was beyond amazing!!!
6269,The smiles that come with the service are almost as good as the food! The chai tea is good too!
6270,Called ahead to check that an item was in stock. Customer service answers yes. Drove across town to find out that they ran out a while ago. Irritating.
6271,Great nostalgia
6272,Great sushi and delicious cuisine. Fast and friendly service.
6273,Highly recommended awesome people work there my pets have always been very relaxed there and they're reasonably priced
6274,My go to shopping palace.
6275,Great  clips  thanks and God bless you
6276,Doctors and contacts/glasses department are 5 stars... the receptionists are some of the rudest people I've ever met (hence 1 star removed). Sadly these are the people you have to deal with to get to the great professionals.
6277,"I had a lot of fears going into the process of getting my wisdom teeth removed. Luckily I was blessed to meet Yer who helped relieve so much of my anxiety. I was shocked at how fast BTY was able to schedule me, perform the work, and get me out the door and home again. Thank you guys so much for making this a pleasant experience for me ❤️"
6278,Always feels right.
6279,"This optometry is a place to get your eyeexam, the service is fast and the staff is awesome in customer service. You will be happy when you leave with a brand new pair of glasses, not only that they have shown that they care and has helped my daughter and self with a pair glasses. We are so grateful for your help. Thank you so much"
6280,It's always a fun time here experienced or not.
6281,"Safeway is the saving grace comparatively to Walmart here on Kodiak. Much like how the French were a foe to Great Britain (before Napoleon messed up) Safeway puts up a fight of savings and club cards against the expensive menagerie that Walmart has. While strictly groceries are sold here, you'll probably get your best shopping here for your everyday food-based needs.

Also, why is the rice forbidden?"
6282,Have been looking for a salon that will help me keep my beard in check for a few years now.  Decided to stop in and ask a few questions and Alice was able to get me in for a trim right away.  She shaped my mane to my face and gave me many tips to keep my beard in check and looking professional.
6283,Nice place not many fast food restaurants welcome you when you walk thru the door like here where they make you feel at home prices leave a bit to be desired tho
6284,"This is a great park for smaller kids, about 8 to 9 is around the age limit I would bring kids here. The older kids would still have some fun. But I believe this park was designed for younger kids in mind like the Campbell Creek park off of Lake Otis and Tudor. For the most part there's decent parking, but for some reason people like to park terrible here and mess up the parking situation. Bring water and snacks also....."
6285,Amazing store with really nice staff
6286,Beautiful place to look at the Matanuska River. And may be able to catch a glimpse of Knik glacier
6287,"Great food, and great service even though they were very busy. Only complaint would be that the coffee wasn't strong enough. Will definitely be going there again though!! Highly recommend"
6288,"Took forever (like two hours) to get a full service oil change, but it's done with good quality"
6289,"Very nice theater, comfortable seat"
6290,Delicious matcha/cold brew with coconut milk...yummy!
6291,To be slow they messed up our order twice. Almost always empty . Staff is decent and freindly
6292,So fun but wish their was more to do
6293,Impersonal
6294,It's nick name is appropriate. Death valley!!! Do not go their any complaints go unanswered.. If I could give it a 0 that's what they would get.
6295,Fiancee toy store! Customer service always pleasant!
6296,"A little more than I'd normally pay for a burrito, but it's a staple of East Anchorage and a perfect way to start the day."
6297,The upgrades dont feel like upgrades. The sound system still sucks.
6298,"Private, great location"
6299,A co worker and i arrived @ 12:05..gave our order at 12:09..@ 12:42 were notified theres no fries and asked if we want onion rings we said no..12:48 our burgers arrive and were the size of a mcdonalds cheeseburger..the waitress was awesome..maybe you should hire people ( cooks) thats organized and to let the waitresses know ahead of time that stock is running low and may be out..and it wasnt that busy..and the burgers were tasteless
6300,"Very friendly staff with excellent customer service. Restaurant has a great choice of food and prices are good. The souvenirs are also reasonable with authentic Alaskan craftsmanship. The ice museum is the crown. A must to see and the guide was very informative.
Accommodation was comfortable and casual.
Great place for the family to come and enjoy or a weekend getaway."
6301,Best place for a clean vehicle
6302,Great atmosphere and food
6303,Good 24/7 grocery store. Easy access on your way out of Anchorage.
6304,Fun place
6305,Got a Ice mocha and it was the best
6306,This is a pretty good spot to do your laundry but the big machines are a bit pricey.
6307,They have great customer service
6308,"Tried and true favorites. Pizza, spaghetti and calzone for the kids. Luscious shrimp scampi..."
6309,Surprisingly good. Had the lunch special with Mongolian beef and chicken fried rice. Wound reccomend
6310,Great place to fish & look at the scenery
6311,"Great haircut and friendly conversation. I didn't have an appointment, but they got me in. I highly recommend this shop and I'll be back, whenever I visit Anchorage again."
6312,They have 4e size shoes.
6313,Quick and efficient service. They work with my insurance so my windshield replacement was completely free!
6314,Definitely one of my best places to go. If they don't have it and you ask.  Next time you go it's there.   Customer service is the best
6315,Baileys furniture is alright. Not the best or most affordable place but its alright. Some workers will welcome you but none will help you find a good mattress or furniture until you go and find a worker and ask them about things they mostly are talking to each other and not to customers until a customer comes up to them.
6316,"Was a customer for 27 years, ever since the current owners purchased it they have never got the order right. I am very disappointed giving it shot after shot hoping they would improve I am no longer a lifelong customer"
6317,Great theatre with comfortable seats.  I enjoy going here often.
6318,"This place is great! They have a large selection. Super friendly cashiers. My only suggestion is for them to do something to identify their staff (name tag, apron, polo) not behind the register. It can take awhile to find help."
6319,It's a dive bar nothing more nothing less. Do have high expectations
6320,Really good food! Love the little area the kids can roam. There's a little waterfall out back that the kids played near and had fun with. The little donuts we're super good and I liked my breakfast platter a lot. Had these seasoned heirloom colorful potatoes that were very good and the bacon was probably the best I've ever had. Highly recommend checking this place out!
6321,"I love TopBop! I try and tell as many people as possible about it. It is SO GOOD. Truly the only fast food I've ever found that is an actual meal , that doesn't leave you hungry 1.5 hours later.  This is a staple of our household"
6322,It's great 😎👍
6323,Don't forget to bring 8 bucks in quarters
6324,Great place. Prices are good.
6325,Beautiful
6326,Nice staff for the best veterans
6327,"The food was great, the staff were great, the chef was awesome, but our waiter not so much. He actually took a phone call while he was serving us. He got irritated with me bcuz I had said something more than once. (Which sometimes I have to bcuz I went into a coma years back) I just wasnt happy with our waiter. Other than that, Benihana was great!🙂"
6328,Very nice second hand store.
6329,"I don't know where Napa finds these people, bit the staff of this particular location on 5th avenue in Anchorage is simply the best. They are very friendly, knowledgeable and, above all, helpful. They will go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need before leaving the store, even if it is just pointers for a project you're working on. Thanks NAPA!"
6330,Try the chowder
6331,Good service. Slow planes though
6332,Valentine's dinner at Texas Roadhouse was awesome! Long wait but they brought you free onion rings and drink while you waited and free drawings for appetizers. Food and atmosphere was  worth the wait! Thank you Texas Roadhouse for a memorable Valentine's dinner
6333,Great prices and customer service. Spoke with a coup film I’ll lll yo
6334,Came to a bazaar here with my daughter.  Lots to things to see and purchase.

6336,I love the Non-Dairy options. The Non-Dairy Maui
6337,"Quick, efficient and delicious! The latest  reimagination of Chan's works very well in the current takeout environment."
6338,Excellent service and attention to all the details. I would highly recommend this dentist to any friends or family.
6339,Fast service and good food.
6340,Pies were perfection
6341,Lots of neat items for your home

6344,Beautiful
6345,"Sunday brunch buffet was okay, service was fair."
6346,Great food
6347,"The Middtown mall has improved over the years and now has a lot more to offer. For example, this summer there was a little farmer's market inside the mall."
6348,Quick n ez
6349,"Buy a lot of parts here, usually get the right parts. If you need new parts that are hard to find this place may have it or maybe could get it."
6350,"Love this place. Amazing seats, great movie prices but the consessions prices are to expensive. I paid more for my snacks than movie tickets and I just dont think that is right. They need to drop a little more and maybe you'd get more business in the food part of your theater."
6351,"Love that I can get a was, grab some camping gear, groceries and get a work out in all in one trip! Ha!"
6352,Great as usual!!
6353,"It's Mcdonalds. Nothing fancy. Good service, friendly staff. Not sure how they can have hot, but stale fries during a rush time but somehow they manage. New chicken tenders always seem overcooked."
6354,"Its the gym on base. It's got literally everything you could want to do at the gym. Large running track, full cardio room, lots of weights, volley ball, racquet ball,  rock wall, a full on ninja course, and my fave the pool. Huge locker rooms with showers and saunas. Great place to go with the kids to wear them out, as well as get your workout in. They even have classes that are free like pyo, kickboxing, and cycling.

So get up, get going and make a new you."
6355,"(Translated by Google) In your lobby, tickets for the cruise through the Kenai Natural Park are collected

(Original)
En su lobby se recogen las entradas para el crucero por el parque natural de Kenai"
6356,Good customer service. Had what I was looking for.
6357,Great gym!
6358,"I usually enjoy going to Louie's that is attached to Uptown Motel, I however took my brother out to The Back Door Lounge which in itself is quite nice however because they allow indoor smoking it's kind of stuff. I've always had fantastic service there though and continue to have fantastic service at the bar."
6359,A very good store to get all your sci-fi marvel and Lord of the rings memorabilia
6360,Relaxing and warm atmosphere
6361,Probably the most well maintained pool in town and the staff is super nice.
6362,"Great views of the mountains. You can only see the to of Denali, but there other mountains down disappoint."

6366,Great service
6367,Alaska Oysters!!!  Live Dungeness!!!
6368,"My favorite place for brunch, though I have been there for every meal. The breakfasts are my favorite, but if you go for brunch you can pair breakfast with an excellent cocktail, and it's hard to beat that!"
6369,Watch the whales at the right time of the year.  Awsome views and picture taking.
6370,"Excellent food, only complaint is the continual Micheal Jackson music playing the entire time you are eating.  Definitely recommend especially if you are a Micheal Jackson fan ."
6371,Incredible place to go hike and enjoy what Alaska has to offer. Exploring the back country close to town.
6372,Live the food
6373,Betty Betty Betty nice

6380,"This is a beautiful place,& very nice"
6381,"I didn't care for the selection, nor my food at all.  I thought the prices were way too high also.  I'd give the place a thumbs down."
6382,"Very good food.  Good table service.  Expensive.  Fun, but not likely to return.  Found the Alyeska experience disappointing."
6383,"Do NOT go to Rachael Coleman! She doesn't listen to you and doesn't call back with important test results. If you want to find out any of your results, you have to call the clinical staff repetitively.
Avoid the stress and frustration and go ANYWHERE but here."
6384,One of the nice ones around town.
6385,Next-door has all your crafting needs in one place. If you go on their app online you can get a coupon.They have a lot to choose from Lots of inspiration just walking around. I do like going to Michael’s more but I had to make the stop and look at what they had to offer here and I was impressed and I was more often don’t count them out.
6386,Nowhere else like it in town. Had a wonderful night when I went to a shoe party where they rented out the place. Nice people and great shoes.
6387,The hometown people
6388,Good service friendly waitress food was cooked proper wait time was ok for as busy as it was
6389,When your fatness has finally reached epic proportions( no pun intended) this is the place to start!! Locket rooms are always gross...but you cant beat 20dollars a month so yea

6391,"Ketchikan is a fun town, lots of shopping, pretty walkable."

6398,The Visitors Center across the street is great. The lady that we met the was wonderful
6399,I was well taken care of at Kendall Ford.  Every courtesy was given me.  I was very pleased at how much help and advice I received when getting my beautiful new Ford Edge.  Justin Endy and his colleagues were very helpful and made my visit and transaction very smooth.
6400,every one was nice @ very helpful THANKS FOR A NICE VISIT

6406,I love eating Taco Bell when I'm drunk.
6407,"Best park in the state, great place for kids to grow up, even has a small park"
6408,Very helpful staff!
6409,We go here to buy a lot of stuff. Same friendly staff the last 20 years. Great prices.
6410,"This is a very fine place for breakfast. There is an extensive menu including good vegan and vegetarian choices. If you  are prepared to spend 10 usd on a juice, you get a very good one, that even includes lemon grass or kale. The omelets are always a good choice, and don't forget about the deserts."
6411,"Great room,. Exceptional service"
6412,Had the everything burger was awesome 1st time eating out since the pandemic
6413,"Peaceful atmosphere,  friendly service."
6414,Great
6415,My experience was an exciting. Had friendly  courteous people all around. Ryan Huntley is an exceptional car salesman.
6416,"Facility is nearly brand new, so it is clean and well maintained.  Could use a few more staff members as the front desk gets quite busy at times."
6417,Store is dirty. We weren't greeted and waited to order for a minute or two. Once Aaron asked us what we wanted he then questioned our order. I had to sit there and explain to him my daughter didn't eat mean and please remove it. We sit down and the food did come fast. My sons order was word and I had to get it fixed. Over all the food was good but the restaurant is dirty and poor customer service.
6418,"I love Joann Fabrics and these ladies were awesome. On a road trip I had forgotten my yarn for a large project with a deadline so stopped in at Joanns hoping for some help. The ladies on duty found exactly what I needed and helped me complete my project. Fantastic place for supplies, ideas,  and fantastic help."
6419,Great food but it is noisy.
6420,"So peaceful and beautiful, just amazing. Wonderful views!"

6422,Great customer service. Employee john is the best employee ive ever met anywhere
6423,One of the docks for Princess Cruises
6424,"Good food. Reasonable. A casual comfortable place.  Service is responsive but not intrusive.  Food is good, portions are about right. My favorite thing is they have some home made picante, ranging from habenero to what appeared to be ghost pepper.  I was not brave enough, or maybe just wise enough not to try the ghost sauce."
6425,One of the nicest airports I've been in. Good food options and great gift options.
6426,"This place is amazing! Small, and intimate.."
6427,They don't sell phones 😥
6428,"The people here seem to act like they are fighting for your business.  Always friendly and willing to help out.  Prices are typically a little more than Lowes, but considering they are just a street light apart, we can generally get what we need between the two.  Spenards is HUGELY overpriced compared to these two, plus Lowes/HD keep their lumber inside (mostly)."
6429,Great place to be close to everything!
6430,Great place to see when on Kenai Peninsula
6431,"Love the curry, love the tea, love this place!"
6432,Cheap nice an worth it of your missing something that needs replaced or want something they have it.

6435,"Good for getting away from the loud commercialism. Nice, small shops, good local restaurants, and convenient bathrooms."
6436,"I brought in my old bike for much needed repairs and ended up talking myself into a new Trek bike, which I absolutely love! I like that the friendly and knowledgeable staff were totally willing to fix up my crusty old bike and didn’t pressure me into the purchase of a new one. I was able to put my new bike on layaway and make payments! Also, even though I have put on a few extra (dozen) pounds since my last pregnancy and no longer look like as fit as I used to be, I was never treated any differently than the triathlete next to me. Bike lovers come in all shapes and sizes and the folks at Backcountry Bike and Ski will make sure your ride is tailored to your specific needs and skill level."
6437,Had a completely terrible experience I was charged for my food even though they cooked old meat and served it to me I asked for a burger in exchange they still wanted to charge me for the old sliders the server was not helpful at all she continued to argue with me attempted to rip things out of my hand I'm never going to eat there again I would not recommend to anybody ever
6438,So far I have loved everything I have tried.  New favorite was the Crab dip
6439,Very delicious. Fast service.
6440,Tiny little bar (with darts) and bowling alley. Very friendly staff at the bar and some good beers. Good prices for Juneau too.

6446,"Totally awesome,  very nice and friendly and top notch service and food.."
6447,Excellent meal for good money and nice helpful service
6448,Nice comfy room. Could have better pillows for bed. Very far from a main town. Not much to do in Girdwood. Gym and pool was closed very disappointed in that.  No washer to do laundry also disappointed:( we went in mid September
6449,Budtenders are very helpful on providing info on cannabis.
6450,"The ""dirty chips"" were very sweet tasting, which is not my preference. But they were good. The wings were average. Average airport place."
6451,Downtown location better selection.
6452,Too expensive.
6453,Not bad place 3
6454,"Been getting my tires their with friendly Service for 15 yrs...Got all 4 tires changed out very quick an economically sound fir the job done.   USUALLY  excellent Service with Chris Evans. But young guy at the register Think his name was Gabe. Acted like my questions were bothersome an had bad attitude toward well paying customer..asked simple questions got snobby attitude .Other guy was very friendly an answered my questions about 20"" rims an tires with professional attitude.. would keep kids like Gabe in the back an away from dealing with customers if he doesn't like answering??'s related to future sales...Got 17's on truck but will be ordering new 20's rims an tires .. Other employee gave me an excellent quotes .unlike Gabe who didnt give me an answer..wont deal with him again..But Great product as usual happy with the new snow tires got us to Barrow breaking trail thru 3ft of snow fir last 200 miles on Arctic ocean"
6455,That was the most unblack Friday I ever seen at walmart. If that what they were aiming for. They nail it. Seen no sales no dvd. It was sad.
6456,"Extremely friendly. Superb customer service and good prices. We take advantage of the weed maps order ahead quiet frequently. My wife places the order and I swing by on my way past there run in and grab it. They always have the order ready and the budtenders and other employees are always super friendly and helpful. Today I went in grabbed our order and away we went like normal. Got home gave the ""package"" to the wife who started grabbing goodies from the bag. She quickly realized that one of the items in the order was not what she ordered. We called the store and they were super happy to have us bring it back and get us back on track with the correct product. We have always been happy with our purchase experiences here and today has made us even happier to continue shopping here."
6457,Good pizza and beer. What more can you want
6458,Generally clean.
6459,Best pizza I've had in year's
6460,"Great sandwiches, salads, deserts."
6461,"Pretty dissappointed with renewing my membership with costco the last 2 years, last year i had the gold membership, didnt make back the membership amount so they sent me a refund check for 28.75. I went in to ask about it, like how i use it etc, said just give it to the cashier when im checking out, so i used it n later when i went to renew my membership they told me i needed the check and it would pay for my next membership but since i used it on food i had to pay another full membership out of pocket, why didnt they tell me that to begin with? Then this year my membership expired on my anniversary day instead of when i actually renewed it, 2 months after my anniversary date cause thats when i could budget in my bills, so i have a cartfull of stuff n them telling me i need to renew when i thought i still had 2 more months so i did not budget the membership fee n had a lil moment of panic in line n asked if i could do a day pass until i can renew, the guy helping me looked like he was going to then this employee lady comes walking over, he explains n she straight up says no you need to renew today with an attitude n i pretty much bust out in tears from embarassment n just walked away...in my eyes i got ripped off 2 months of membership n then that lady's attitude towards me did it for me (dimond costco, short heavyset black lady with glasses n freckles), im done with yall, going to sams club now, which is really disappointing for me cause normally i love costco."
6462,"Customer service is friendly, but don't ask for any help! Most likely the employees are clueless to what is where anymore."
6463,As ever my request for a plain 1/4 pounder just meant and a bun arrived with cheese. My server however was apologetic and I had the correct order delivered within minutes.
6464,"The convenience store had everything we needed plus liquor! We got gas, milk, doughnuts, snacks, etc.  It was well stocked and busy with customers standing in line. Multiple clerks had the line moving quickly."
6465,Great facility.
6466,"Outside dining and they wouldn't let my little, calm dog in with me. Usually like to dine beside the creek. They lied and said that it was due to the health dept that my daschund couldn't sit with me. Just be honest and say that you don't like well mannered dogs."
6467,Awesome
6468,"A must see in Anchorage!  Glen alps (aka ""flat top"") easily has the best view in the area!  Walk up the western path for easy/okay, go up the eastern trail for harder walking/amazing views."
6469,Great place for starters and experts alike.
6470,Every one was very helpful and wished me luck with my new pet!
6471,Not bad
6472,Family fun
6473,It's a  plane  ride.
6474,Sucks
6475,Nice pizza and hut dog. Their turkey and  provolone cheese sandwich was disgusting.
6476,The best shusi place on the planet
6477,Our pup is always feeling better after a visit here. Thanks Dr. Rember for taking such good care of our guy!!
6478,Great place if you know what you want and can find it yourself. Today was a good day and I actually found some help who knew where the product was without having to call someone else.
6479,Great trails and views. Must be wildlife conscious and carry necessary survival items.

6490,Great venue for baseball.
6491,"I moved to Anchorage a little over 2 years ago in 2016.  I;m from the East coast so a clean, precise haircut for my particular hair style is a necessity.  I tried a few different places that were over my price range for a quality haircut.  I came upon Hair Science and made an appointment.  They told me the haircuts would take about an hour because it's a barber school.  You arrive at the top of the hour and every time the staff greets and welcomes you.  Literally the enter staff acknowledges that you've just arrived like you just showed up to a house party.  It feels good and kind of breaks the ice, so to speak. They all dress very sharp.  Each student has different skill levels which Shawn (Owner and teacher) goes over and after the haircut makes sure he is happy with it and you are.  They are consistent with the quality they bring out and they are always improving.  I remember consecutive appointments I would be assigned to the same person and they got significantly better each time.  It's nice to be a part of a place that cares about it's growth in a sense that the students are working to get better at giving you a fresh haircut.  Everyone's always in a good mood and there's always music in the background and sports on the TV's.  It's more than just a service at Hair Science.  It's an experience.  I look forward to each of my appointments cause I forget everything I'm stressing about in life.  I'm at this place and I'm present.  And in that 1 hour I'm being laughing and chatting with the staff.  There's also a sweet picture of Marvel's Black Panther on the back wall.  Hair Science Forever."
6492,Fresh and yummy. Ticket got lost and had to wait a bit.

6502,"B.G. is the best marijuana retail store in Alaska. They have unbeatable prices and selection of smoking utensils, the best marijuana in town no matter what form you like it in. I've never been disappointed. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and fun. It's like Cheers everyone knows your name (even with a mask on!) I spread the word to everyone I know that Bad G is the place to be."
6503,Great Talent & Ink...
6504,Cheap smokes 4 bein downtown
6505,Quite cooperative and kind professional workers at this quaint grocery store!!!
6506,Expected a great meal..food was very salty.
6507,"Both my husband and I loved the food we got both yesterday and today.  The Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket satisfies his Arby cravings.  I preferred the taste of the Turkey Bacon Ranch over Subway's version.  Its quickly become one of our favorite restaurants in Fairbanks.

The staff are friendly and working hard to keep the line moving.  They do their best to get your order right the first time."
6508,Loved the drive. Loved sledding. Beautiful
6509,Could not find what I was looking for. Asked for help and was led around the store by employees that did not know where the product was

6524,Beautiful place!
6525,"""Wicked friendly staff, sauces on the tables, mouth-watering menu."""
6526,"Super friendly staff. I always feel welcome. The staff is on the younger side however they work hard, help out as best they can, and make you feel valued regardless if you’re spending $5 or $500, everyone is taken care of. Their selection is top notch, I highly (pun intended) recommend this shop. PS: they have a huge selection of just about everything bud related."
6527,"Mammoth Music has been a staple business in the Anchorage area for as long as I can remember. They have always been the place to go, have great prices on fantastic merchandise and are very knowledgeable."
6528,Great pizza
6529,Great fair!!
6530,Best diner in Fairbanks
6531,Awesome tour and opportunity to learn about  Alaskas gold mining history.    You will also have the opportunity to pan for gold :)
6532,Fish on!
6533,I highly recommend going here for any of your car wash needs
6534,"Helpful staff, but sadly couldn't find the two things I needed."
6535,I feel this place just didn't do much for me personally our server was extremely busy and seemed like the only server there in the morning to attend around 20 tables. Which is alot so we were rushed and didn't feel very welcomed. Our food was so so wasn't too bad but wasn't great the few times we've been here the service hasn't changed.
6536,Love the place and people
6537,Old building looks like it has rodents. Food not bad. Customer services was lacking. Fake vibe of happy smiles
6538,Cheap cut some times a long wait on weekends people are friendly.
6539,"Several empty stores, not much there"
6540,Could improve on their customer service but I love the merchandise.
6541,Son graduated here with Master's degree.
6542,"Amazing gluten-free and vegan options for sweets and pastry! The coffee is pretty good, and the tea selection is also very good. The iced tea starts out as hot tea, though, so it become watery. Waffles here are fluffy and filling, especially with the toppings. Generally, breakfast takes a lot longer than your average restaurant because it's first a cafe, not a breakfast place. We waited a very long time on some egg sandwiches on one of our visits and haven't ordered breakfast since. However! we still always come. For the cupcakes and sweets!"
6543,"Good food, little pricey, but it's quality! Service was good when we went too."
6544,Nice little spot that feels intimate and tucked away. Food and service did not disappoint.
6545,I ordered the combo of lobster tail and foxy cut of prime rib. My husband ordered halibut chunks and portabella mushroom fries. It were really delicious.
6546,Right next too couple local bars great for the weekend
6547,Great Pizza! Best in Ketchikan
6548,"Good food, fatty service"
6549,Excellent
6550,Took my car in to get an oil change ended up buying a SUV for my mom while we waited. Oscar was amazing and truly excels at his profession.
6551,Excellent customer service. Waiter was very knowledgeable about the beer and gave great recommendations
6552,Best price in town especially if you sjop in the store and use their gas credits.
6553,Informative and friendly people
6554,"Nice park with year round activities. Trails are groomed in winter. Snowmachining, and ice fishing. They had an ice rink this year. Beach access in summer. Boat rentals, some crazy sport with kayaks and Frisbees. There's a designated shooting range. Motorboat, 4 wheeler, and dirt bike access, hiking trails.

Usually there's not a lot there to hold interest for more than a few hours, but it's a pretty chill place. Geocaches around the lakes. Good place for BBQ. There are fire pits.

I don't work for the city lol. It's just easy to stop by on the way home to North Pole."
6555,Went for my birthday burger & sundae. Yum!!
6556,Got better security guards now
6557,Great place friendly staff
6558,Very much enjoyed staying here. The location is beautiful and the resort itself has excellent amenities.
6559,ive had problems with the bread being moldy on several purchases
6560,Worth the wait😁
6561,Good breakfast and very good service!
6562,Good food. Menu is pretty limited. Drinks were good but not strong. It was ok. The staff was a bit slow especially on a calm Friday night.
6563,Good
6564,Ordered French Dip and a Lonestar Jalapeno burger. Both were very good. The only thing keeping me from giving all 5 stars is the staff never smiled.
6565,I purchase gas here frequently. I've never personally had any issues with the quality of fuel or pump malfunctions but there has been credit card skimmer hardware recovered from the pumps and a large number of people had their card information stolen. I always tug on the card readers just to make sure.
6566,Friendly helpful staff!
6567,had carpets cleaned professional and on time. i would have them clean again. Price competive.
6568,The youngest son's knowledge of the Tony Know trail is amazing as his customer service.
6569,Interesting
6570,Lots of trails
6571,"Great staff, great food, and baked goods. Try the Italian lasagne, it rocks!"
6572,"Great food! All you can eat roast beef, Alaskan cod, and salmon, plus salad bar and dessert. Fantastic! Plus, a mining motif! Excellent food!"
6573,Good food. Seated immediately. Food took some time.
6574,i stooped here to use bathroom and stayed because its so freaking cool i suggest anyone driving this highway to make a point to stop here and see falls.
6575,Pretty bad when you have to ask for napkins and straws cuz they never know what the other is taking care of.
6576,"Great burger, fries, and milk shake.  No inside dining at present."
6577,"Love Cabelas, great place for outdoor needs. Bargain cave is good for great deals."
6578,Love
6579,"2.5 stars= For quickly having food prepared, cooked thoroughly and ready to pick up in a little over 10 minutes.

Receipt rang up to $43.25! Quality of food was okay, but DEFINITELY not worth it. The service was quick. The young woman who took my order was polite, but neglected to inform me of how they price the menu items. Which I might add, is not the correct pricing as on the online menu.
Order:
1. RLE Philly cheesesteak (=Subway wrap)
2. Small Fry
3. Bleu cheese burger (=Burger King Whooper w/chz)
4. Large Onion ring
5. 2 Large fountain drinks (=McD's medium drink)

Unfortunately, I had assumed when ordering a sandwich or burger, that it would have a side (fries, chips etc) This was the first time I have had anything from Tommy's, so it's possible that I had high hopes after reading so many good reviews. But pretty disappointed with the ""ok"" quality of our food."
6580,Poor service my appetizer and entree came out at the same time after waiting 45 minutes and watching people who came in after me get their food....
6581,They take great care of our pup!
6582,Fun! Just discovered this place. Mt daughter and I had a blast!
6583,Great awesome crepes!  Main area is very small but they have a deck and another eating area.
6584,Good clothes at fair prices.
6585,"Love this place and come here often. Great food, great smiles and always leave happy!"
6586,Great
6587,Very pretty
6588,"Great German food, simple menu but authentic. Relaxed atmosphere and good service. I spent 8 years in Germany and it's the closest thing I've had in the states that can be called authentic German food. They close early weekdays at 9 and weekends at 10 which would be my only complaint."
6589,Gas not cheap in Alaska.
6590,"Home made buns, hand cut fries.   Best burgers and fries in Anchorage.   But be warned:  It really is a saloon.  Kids are welcome, but I don't think I'd take my grandkids.  Too bad for them. GREAT burgers!"
6591,Good food and every good customer service
6592,Quick and cheap pizza with a very nice sale every month.
6593,"Great place for seafood, especially local, and Pacific oysters."
6594,This place has a huge selection and a little bit of everything!
6595,They helped duplicate my key and they were quick.
6596,their pulled pork is cooked well and their sauce is different and interesting. Only thing is that they need more seasoning on the meat. 4 stars my guy
6597,Great breakfast
6598,"Pretty dang good pepper steak, nice place to stop in and check out."
6599,Not impressed. It was overpriced and mediocre at best.  $13.95 for a bean burrito and soda.  My tortilla split as they were making it so the girl behind the counter just slopped it into a new tortilla leaving most of the fillings on the tortilla that was thrown in the trash.  I will not go back anytime soon.
6600,Simply beautiful.  We hiked there ourselves.
6601,Very impressed. I was afraid that I would come in and still feel like I was eating at the old Phillips International but they've done a great job redesigning the interior. The menu has everything from a simple bacon cheese burger to a braised short rib that sounded delicious (unfortunately they were out of that). I had the smoked pork/pineapple pizza that was very good. The kids meatball sliders were the perfect size (two in an order). The chicken tenders looked to be made in-house. They were generous/juicy chicken pieces (light and dark) that were beaded and fried. The braised pork shoulder was again a very generous portion on top of a huge buttermilk biscuit with slaw/sauce/caramelized onion. The staff was extremely attentive and polite. Definitely recommend checking it out
6602,Family owned great food.
6603,"I have always Loved this store! I was there a week or so ago and got great buys on several needed items, as well as several Christmas gifts. I also found a perfect pair of much-needed rugged sneakers. The workers there are consistently helpful, professional, cheerful, and courteous. The store atmosphere is always very upbeat and positive, and I can stand and watch the fish forever! Long live Cabela's!"
6604,The open face crab sandwich was terrific the service was perfect and the view was spectacular
6605,Nice local place to join friends on Christmas Day! Thanks to the staff!
6606,"Do you need items for your garden, pets, or yard? Chances are excellent they will have it, and, you will get good customer service, as well!"
6607,"A mellow option to some of the other overcrowded grocery stores.
However, a nonsensical layout detracts.
Good customer service."
6608,Absolutely love this woman she made me the most amazing and best prices in town ❤️ highly recommended.... I asked for a realistic brain cake for my son and hats exactly what I got.. 🥰
6609,Clothes and shoes selection is not so great compared to other states.
6610,The food is great & I had a 3 out of 5 being hott
6611,"Knowledgeable, relatable and kind."
6612,Fast service.Pricy. Bathrooms were awfull dirty.
6613,Great food
6614,"It was okay, because the waitresses were kind of mean."
6615,They'll walk you through all the different types of beds and let you try them out. They made it a really fun and easy experience. Defintely be going back the next time I need another bed.
6616,"It is an iconic spot in Alaska. That being said here are the facts.

1. Always packed ( in my mind this is a good thing... means it is good ) but expect to wait 20 -40 min. You can drink while you wait so its not a bad thing.

2. Food is good never had a bad thing here.

3. Beer is drinkable but it kinda all taste the same. beer ranks 2/5

All this being said you have to go there at least once."
6617,The bathrooms where dirty. Staff was not helpful. Took forever to get checked in.
6618,So fun
6619,Great store!
6620,"The food was amazing, the perfect amount of spice. The staff is super nice  and the atmosphere was clean and well decorated. I wish I had pics of the food but I sent them to a friend on an app I cant access :( take my word it was aesthetically pleasing and the taste matched!!! Please disregard photo it's from the wrong place and I cant figure out how to delete it."
6621,Excellent service.  Fabulous products and an amazing staff!
6622,"Sweet spot!  Good coffee, food, and atmosphere!"
6623,Great breakfast
6624,Food is great but takes a long time to get
6625,Okay tther
6626,"Probably the best oriental food in the valley.  I love the ringing freedom of America, but sometimes heavily Americanized food isn't what I want.  This place is the best."
6627,Went shopping!
6628,"Always flavorful food, great staff.
A clean friendly eatery and fun sportsclub.
And great live music too.
What's Tuesdays Soup? 🍽"
6629,So much fun!
6630,"(Translated by Google) Beautiful landscape, mountains, glacial, snow and water. Awesome alaska

(Original)
Hermoso paisaje, montañas, glacial, nieve y agua. Alaska impresionante"
6631,Friendly staff
6632,Great southern food and atmosphere
6633,"Older movie theater but best prices in town. We join the regal Movie club,$21 per month she is many movies as you want to see as many times as you want. Nothing beats that"
6634,Fast food if you want. Same as everywhere else
6635,Needs more venders
6636,No service skills. We didn't even get a thank you from the staff.
6637,Beer run!
6638,Really good filling spider rolls are huge! Good lunch deal for military
6639,Well I really wasn't looking for a vehicle but I definitely needed one Sam Jones was excellent he got me into a 2013 Chevy Silverado crew cab all I have to say is Thank You Sam
6640,I've eaten in restaurants all over the world.  This rates among the best.  Imagine that - in Wasilla!  Thank you owners for providing a little joy in my life.
6641,"Competitive prices, selection, and a friendly staff make HD my home improvement choice."
6642,My trip to the store was good. I got what I wanted and had help finding some other things I've been considering. The staff assisted me with putting my screen saver on. And informed me of the permancy of the fixture I was a bout to use. I do wish they had a little bit of a larger selection of cases for my phone.
6643,Great view
6644,The trail is covered in ice in winter. Shoe traction is definitely needed in some points. One slip and you might slide 100 feet!
6645,The drive to Chitina is off of the beaten path but well worth the time and effort. This town is deeeep into Alaska and a place where Alaska residence can dip net for salmon coming up stream. So depending on the time you are here it could be a little busy with people filling up their freezer with fish. Small town with neat people.
6646,"Awesome sushi place! I love the Lunch boxes on weekdays, and for dinner the Hot Night roll is the best. Very good poke appetizer, and tempura calamari. Nothing not to like here."
6647,Go to Karstens Public House. We stop in for drinks and food on the way to the park. Atmosphere is very cool and the service has always been very good
6648,Best smoothies
6649,AMAZING food! Service was ok but will be going back again for the food.
6650,"I would say the best place we ate in Talkeetna. The food options were enough, the beer was wonderful. The appetizers were small for their price.  Service got a little slowed down as the place filled up. A must-see if you're at Talkeetna, even for just a couple hours."
6651,"Fun fair even in the rain.  Lots of live music, beer and craft shopping"
6652,In n out
6653,Not much customer services.
6654,Excellent products and pricing as well as weekend community evolvement and education.
6655,The burrito sizes vary quite often but are still pretty good.
6656,"Cashew chicken was amazing.  And
$15 lunch specials, took home a second meal from leftovers."
6657,"Enjoyed the gyro pita here!! Great service, fast & friendly"
6658,Food sucked
6659,What a little gem of a place. I’ll be back. I’ll bring friends!!
6660,"SKECHERS is a great store to shop at. They have a top notch team of employees who are very friendly and helpful in making your purchase. They have great deals like, when I purchased a pair of shoes, I got a second pair for 1/2 off the purchase price. I'll be back!!"
6661,"(Translated by Google) Very well work fast and good attention

(Original)
Muy bien  trabajan rápido y buena  atencion"
6662,Awesome food and great service would recommend to anyone
6663,"The only complaint is that I wish they would show different movies than Orca. They would get far more business, too."
6664,Very good
6665,"Friendly staff, clean store, quality items at a reasonable price and a good location."
6666,Been there 3 times in 10 years....after leaving each time I had an upset stomache....peeked in the back...NOT the cleanest
6667,This is a great place for all.  You learn about mining in Alaska and get to pan for gold.  And yes you will find gold.  Great for kids of all ages
6668,This is the best and fastest place to eat in Juneau with friendly service and food that deserves a award
6669,Long check out times.
6670,I Love there fries
6671,"Not impressed 😕, service was ok, food was very sub par for the amount of money spent. I know all restaurants have a off day and I might give you guys another shot but it was hard to to pay as much as we did for a not so great meal between the bunch of us. Out of the 5 people at our table 4 of them complained about the food."
6672,It is a very nice Walmart.  Helpful employees that now the inventory. The store is very clean with wide isles.
6673,Ok
6674,Yummy fast food prepared by an excellent cook!
6675,Great sandwiches. Awesome Service
6676,Hanging out with the family for the weekend.  Going to the Sea life Center. We came across this eatery. And to hear the kids talk about how the cook did an amazing job on their food was pretty cool. They are very picky eaters. The halibut fish and chips are truly the best I've had in my 25 year Alaska experience. They will see us on every visit.
6677,"Went here twice because of its proximity. Both times there is a long line and only one person at the counter. Both times took half an hour just to get to the said counter  and people kept showing up then leaving due to the wait. I don't know if it's understaffed or this is standard operation. As of this writing, 10 minutes till closing, one customer is haggling over priced and getting a walkthrough of different storage units. If there is any kind of management on premises they need to keep an eye on this toward close. Either assign someone to help, or man a counter yourself for a few. This way you don't have a line of people waiting half an hour at an empty counter while the lone salesman does a walking tour for someone.... Who admittedly did not plan on getting a unit today. Better yet have a manager take that over so the salesman can get other customers through."
6678,"(Translated by Google) Super excellent.

(Original)
Super excelente.💯💯"
6679,"So good. Expect a slower drive thru, but it's always fresh and hot."
6680,Has great coffee and a friendly place
6681,The best ever
6682,Quick service and employees are usually kind
6683,Pretty cool even in the winter.
6684,Great rustic scenery excellent product everytime
6685,It's great all around
6686,"The owner barged in to my place at 3am, started snooping around, and started screaming at people about smoke he thought he smelled. Weirdest guy ever. His wife seems nice, and had no idea he was late night wandering. Nice place but avoidable situation and creepy as hell. Stay home and watch a horror film instead."
6687,Great food and friendly service
6688,Incredible views and paved trails for miles. Shoreline access everywhere.
6689,"Like it.
But near by We ordered the garlic knots and two medium pies to share: the XX (pesto, artichoke, red onion, bacon, feta, mozzarella) and the XY (marinara, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mozzarella).
The garlic knots were little bombs of buttery, yeasty goodness, and the garlic was robust but not overpowering. When our pizzas arrived, our expectations continued to be exceeded.
The crust was crisp, flavorful, and chewy. The toppings worked together beautifully. The marinara and pesto were packed with flavor, and the mozarella had a great consistency and very little oil. By the end of the meal we were planning our next visit."
6690,"Went with a friend.  They seemed rushed and crowded.  The young lady doing my pedicure did well but never asked if the temperature was ok and I almost got burned.  While getting mine done the girl working next to us was doing a friend and talked about her parking tickets and how she ""didn't know it was a thing"" or that anyone paid attention to those signs in regards to handicap parking. She then said she ""went out and got herself one"" (handicap tag).  This spoke volumes about some of the type of people they hire.  There are lots of nail salons and I'm not sure if I will  return to this one or not."
6691,Always a treat.
6692,Gotta get there pretty early to begin your 4 hour wait but I had an amazing case worker and I don't plan on going there to many more times.. I am looking for a job though and ya'll should hire some more people.  Just saying😉
6693,"Been going there for all my tire needs for 10years always good service, and great prices."
6694,I love going to this store first
6695,Lots of neat stuff here.
6696,Hassle free!!!
6697,Nice visit with Diane Ecklund. My dogs looooove the place. So 5 stars they said to give 😄
6698,It okay
6699,"Great Service! Very helpful, like all business in the valley. Unlike, Anchorage!
Go see them, they’ll take care of you.."
6700,Area around check out stands are too crowded. You can't get a cart through there. Move the displays away.
6701,They're clean they're nice.
6702,Great lunch special price. Had some spicy drunken noodles
6703,Always backed up and the icecream machine is permanently broken
6704,"Been here twice now, the subs have been great, good amount of fresh meat, good bread, a small variety of hot sauces available near the soda fountain. FYI the medium sods is huge."
6705,"I get my snake food here every couple of weeks! great selection of treats and toys, wish they would have more cat toys though"
6706,Decent waiter but the food wasn't very hot so that was disappointing.  I had friends with me so I didn't want to hold my group up but by myself I would have sent it back for correction.
6707,Was always good and reasonable prices for a quick meal.
6708,Decent food decent price
6709,"Ok for a quick bite, fair prices and good variety"
6710,"(Translated by Google) Professionals, they have been doing excursions for more than 20 years.

6711,The food is delicious
6712,Great place with excellent food.  Went for lunch and had tomato basil soup and bread bites.....so tasty and delicious!!  Outside seating is clean and welcoming.  Will definitely go again!
6713,Horrible customer service. Wouldnt give me a fork which is fine but nothing wrong with kindly explaining the reason
6714,"Yes Virginia, this is a grocery store."
6715,"Just a group of unemployed tire technicians, related to the owner, making Class A repairs to your vehicle. No ASE certified mechanics on site.. haven't been for a number of years. This shop is waaaaay past its prime, and is currently under liquidization and reorganization. Hours are cut to part time. This is a shop owner who would pay his employees $5/hour, if it were up to him."
6716,Love the store but slow
6717,Amazing
6718,Very good selection and great price.
6719,Excellent service and great selection.
6720,Its beautiful and I walked over 3400 steps
6721,"Everything you could need under one roof (including diamonds, if you are in that market). Their “Simple Truth” line of products is excellent and often the cheapest option as well. This is also a great store for the types of outdoor gear that all Alaskans need. Their organic section is great and they support local farmers as well. Alaskan grown carrots are about the crunchiest and sweetest you will ever bite into!"
6722,Awesome bears with staff who will happily tell you all about them.
6723,Beer and pizza - at the end of a long day. I'll be back.
6724,"Had lunch here the other day. My sandwich was so big, I had to take half of it home. Their portions are large! And the food was delicious! I highly recommend this place!"
6725,I love CITC
6726,I've been a satisfied customer with cc and Skidoo for 50 years
6727,"Delicious food, variety of choices and very good ambience. The portions are large too so although this place is pricey if you order the right things you may not end up paying too much or wasting. Between 2 people we ordered an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. The entree came with a side salad which we upgraded to ceasar salad for just $3 extra. The server was friendly and nice. Vegetarian friendly choices"
6728,We had the avacado fries and the halibut tacos. Forget the avacado as it was just covered in chili spice. That's all you tasted but the halibut tacos were amazing.
6729,They have really great chicken
6730,Interior currently under construction and dine-in is not an option. Drive- thru is open.
6731,Great Deals using peace matching
6732,Very good only one thing I ordered beans with my birria tacos and I didn't get it. Other then that the portions are amazing you definitely will get full. I hope to be back at some point

6744,My kids had fun and they even played some kids music.
6745,"This place has good food. My wife got the Rib eye and I got a Pizza. They were both very good. The interior of the restaurant was very nice, and my wife loved the wine.  The menu has a nice selection of different types of food and they have a large wine menu.

I didn't give it 5 stars due to the long wait. Overall great food and a good atmosphere."
6746,I wasn't the least bit satisfied with how it cleaned my Prius.  The wash doesn't seem to be able to get under things but it also failed to clean the sides.
6747,Great place great brands great staff and great prices. I am a happy member
6748,Great service!
6749,Best Airport North of Tampa International.

6753,Found everything to satisfying and easy to find and staff was helpful.
6754,Management ensures that too few check out lanes are open at all times leading to a pointless 15 minutes standing in line at the end of every trip.
6755,Found the publications I wanted. Saved $ by joining the rewards.
6756,"We often get pizza from here. The Greek pizza is the best. Delivery takes a while so plan ahead, but the food always arrives hot."

6770,"Decent buffet prices, cucumbers are always going bad and almost everytime we see flies there. Ice-cream doesnt even taste like icecream :( but pizzas and other foods are pretty good, I like their fruit and salad bar. Mashed potatoes taste kind of weird too.

6793,Love this place. I always try to spend money here to support these guys. Always great deals to be had.
6794,"The food is good, but the people aren't great."
6795,Beth Cassidy with Unity Home group was Awesome! She met up with me and gave her expert advice on how to move forward with selling my home and possibly even finding a new one at the same time! Working with her was an absolute pleasure. 10/10 recommend! :)
6796,Pleasant experience.  The food and service was good.
6797,Things are kinda pricey and the store is very outdated.  They also have a terrible location that makes then6 hard to find and see easily.  They are your typical Sears nothing special.
6798,Lava car wash is super cool
6799,Don't waste your time. Your better off going to another urgent care or Anchorage
6800,"I don't normally order pizza for delivery. But, flying in after three months out in Dutch Harbor, I took a chance with Guido's. Needless to say, I was pleasently surprised. Fast delivery with no extra charge (I tipped the driver instead), great pizza with plenty of toppings, and and awesome prices. I'll definitely order from them again 👍👍"
6801,"Had a blast climbing varies mountains throughout the park. Grizzlies can be seen near the open fields. Beware of Mooses! Had one bought take out my husband.  Literally ran for our lives,  still fun though. Various little gophers along the ridges. Do not feed them.  The people in front of us did and the animal climbed up the woman's pant leg and wouldn't get off. Anyways, gorgeous views and plenty of photo opportunities. If your feeling really adventures and got time to spare try your luck at climbing Mt. Danali, just make sure you bring provisions."
6802,Tram was good. Enjoyed our time. Food was better than expected at the top.  Our view was limited due to weather but that should be expected.  Wish parking was a little closer.
6803,"Great place to bring kids!! Our toddlers, kindergartener and teen all enjoyed themselves! Granted, this place isn't as grandiose as other aquariums out of state, however, it's worth adding to your Seward bucket list! They also have a nice gift shop."
6804,Great burgers and milkshakes with a classic Alaskan feel!
6805,"Petr is a great luthier, and a gift to the community in Anchorage.  His store has a wide range of stringed instruments in a variety of price ranges, and his people have the knowledge to help you shop and choose.   I recommend this as a first stop for new instruments or repair."
6806,Neat place to get an idea about where to go
6807,Karaoke. Fridays and Saturdays.
6808,"Not bad! I've tried the Smokehouse Brisket and that's it. It's so good I can't bring myself to try anything else. The sauce is great and the quantity of meat is more than I expected. When you take into consideration, other fast food hamburger joints, have patties that look like a semi rolled back and forth over it,Arby's packed the meat on and for a decent price. Very pleased overall. Arby's,they have the meats!Thanks!!"
6809,Nice place.   Ok food
6810,Fun
6811,"Love the service, every employee I've interacted with has been super friendly and efficient. One reason I continue to choose Coffee Queen is because they are consistent in the way they prepare their drinks,  it doesn't matter which girl I get on any given day my drink is always the same and any coffee drinker knows that this is a rare find."
6812,Convenient to the airport and south Anchorage shopping
6813,It's McDonald's the food is good sometime the service is super slow and they keep giving me a medium tea when I get a large meal. Why do I want a medium when I want a large meal? Lol
6814,Big land and area for atv's
6815,Wow what can I say this is got to be one of my favorite restaurants in the area I never go to a restaurant more than once when traveling but I did at the Palmer city ale house they have something going on almost each night whether it's run club yoga on the lawn or live music even during the pandemic everyone was safe  And the food is phenomenal got to be one of the best bloody marys I think I've ever experienced word recommend this place to anybody in the area and the views are absolutely breathtaking if you sit outside
6816,"Great prices, excellent food"
6817,Ordered a new bed frame and it seems like I got a nice deal compared to other selections from other stores.
6818,"It's ok.  Food is adequate, but there are better Mexican joints."
6819,Monster biscuits  are good
6820,Love their food! Excellent
6821,"It's a nicotine paradise, like Sammy Hagar, Ted nudgent, and the Marlboro Man put it on paper... Las vegas in the 70's, Frankfurt in the 80's.   Not a lunch spot.     Old luster rotting in the woods... I'm sure it parties on New Years, and tobacco Tuesday."
6822,Showed up with a reservation at 7 p.m. was not asked about drinks until 40 minutes later then 20 minutes later got our drinks and got our food ordered a little disappointed 😐
6823,Lovely community gathering. Music art and prime plants and everything you could need for cultivating the best of Alaska summer. Fun for all ages.
6824,"It's a gorgeous place and the rooms are really nice. The kitchenette has no dishes or utensils,  so I'm not sure why they even bother having a kitchenette.
I also couldn't find a way to set the temperature in the room. There was a fan to use so I opened the door and turned on the fan. It seemed kind of out-of-place for such a nice inn.
There was a terrible mixup with my reservation but the staff went out of their way to make it right. I really appreciated it after a very long day of travel.
Certainly it's worth the money! Go. You won't be sorry."
6825,A returning customer every time!!!😁👍Got all the supplies you need.
6826,Major selection of sauces. Every kind ever.
6827,My fiance got me hooked on this place. I love their salsa and macaroons and am looking forward to macaroons they're making for our wedding.
6828,"Beautiful sunset glowing on sparkling snow, a nice break from the city."
6829,Mama Mia rules 💜
6830,"Wonderful food, but I'm giving them 3 stars because they have a $1.50 credit card surcharge which is undisclosed and not properly displayed at the point of sale as required by all major card issuers."
6831,Very long time to wait for a customer service representative.... lifeline service is very good and very very confusing with all of the rules and regulations of bringing your own phone and phone number to get lifeline service.
6832,"Ski, hike, bike."
6833,Good Salad Bar
6834,Nice cozy little place
6835,Cute castle playground.
6836,Great trails suggest toilet bowl
6837,Camping made easy!
6838,Food was extremely slow. Waiter was far too distracted trying to get female attention.
6839,Great food truck guy's
6840,Its a chicken place. Ok food won't be going back nothing special.

6849,It's a Subway. It was exactly what I expected.
6850,This is a dump.. Some well keep homes in the park. Looks like a very unsafe place to live. Most need to be updated or torn down.
6851,Cool
6852,"Pretty fancy downtown place. Pricey, but you get what you pay for."
6853,"Slid my poor car into a ditch on my way to work last month. Greg Peede saw and pulled me out, then recommended I come to his work to have it looked at. When I got there, Rick took care of everything for me. They patched my window so I wouldn't get cold and cleaned up all the broken glass. Then they coordinated with my insurance for me to get repairs done. It took a little over a week to do them, but you won't hear any complaints from me. They did an excellent job replacing the entire door and rear window, and even changed a dead headlight for me. Not to mention, detailed the whole thing when they were done. Thank you!"
6854,Hum its oka
6855,Bad food bad attitudes and need better customer service.
6856,"Horrible. Go to IHop or better yet Denali Restaurant on the Parks Hwy who was the original owner of MatSu Family Restaurant.
I hate to give bad reviews.... but the agony of seeing the stressed out staff is a direct result of the owners."
6857,We had our conversion there. Very nice place
6858,"Great place to experience nature, hike, and meditate. Great for skiing when snow lands!"
6859,End of the dalton hwy has what you need
6860,Hook em....... when they run....
6861,Don't vape it's deadly....
6862,Very good selection and services.
6863,"Great special of the day, turkey and cheese sandwich. The tomato soup and the bread were very tasty as was the white bean soup.  Great little place for lunch!"
6864,As allows good
6865,There are two entry ways and a bench to take in the view of the mountains. If you keep driving past the Viewpoint you will reach Talkeetna's town attractions.
6866,I love my tacos from there 😀
6867,Food is not good
6868,Have enjoyed ourselves every time we've come
6869,Nicely maintained.
6870,It's starting to come back to life since the covid virus thank heavens...
6871,Dirty and massively overpriced. Deli and salad bar were scary.

6873,It's been a minute but very good.

6879,Very friendly place
6880,Chophouse burger is better than the other great burgers
6881,This place has roaches and hasn't had any kind of upgrade in like 10 years. My kids have been going here for years but sheesh Alaska needs a new water park!
6882,"I'll tell you what, the guy running the drive-thru line is an absolute stud. He had my two friends completely sold on the new pub sandwiches, and they knew it, and all the while keeping a good sense of humor about himself. I personally can't even imagine how one would create a hamburger bun out of a pretzel, but I guess that's not up to me to decide if it's possible. Get'cho self some pretzel burgers!"
6883,Big box at its most brazen!
6884,Great place to take your kids to burn off some of that energy they have. Also a fun place for parties.
6885,Great customer service and food.  I appreciate the military discount as well.
6886,Never get all my order thay will tell you thay will bring it to you but don't bad service
6887,Great coffee and quick service!
6888,Great food! Servers make you feel like royalty. My bestie treated me to a very unusual and delectable mimosa during our lunch. It's not a quiet place but it is definitely a place for you want to take your besties.
6889,An Eagle River tradition.
6890,"Nice place for a quick lunch, artisan sandwiches are a bit pricey and the amount of seating is limited, but I was told that it is run by students from the local seminary and they of course are friendly and cheerful.  The gift shop portion is quite unique, lots of icons, matryoshka (nested dolls), and local crafts. The dining room walls have recycled art, placemats and rugs made from used boat ropes (lines), and other nautical items.  My sandwich was a good portion of turkey and cheese with a tasty mayo and my daughter-in-law had a veggie burger that’s she described as excellent. Parking is limited and it is best approached from the south but if you have the time it is a far better choice than the McDonald's across the street."
6891,"Captain Cook is a landmark in Anchorage! GREAT restaurant's, wine bar, and the Cafe has incredible breakfasts! JR. Suite was perfect for pre-party prior to company celebration"
6892,They will add an egg to any burger. Sold me right there. Martinis are pretty yum too!
6893,Amazing burritos
6894,Great customer service
6895,Great business with honest and helpful staff.
6896,People are rude as hell. Tables are dirty. Bathrooms are nasty. Not sure why because they are dead.
6897,It's a nice place to visit.
6898,Great people work here
6899,"A great place for kids and adults to hang out and play games. Comics, games, and more."
6900,"Great service, nice atmosphere, good drinks. Sports bar and a place that seems like friends meet there. I'll be back..."
6901,"My mother and I always wanted to ride the train, but we haven't had the time or it wasn't financially possible."
6902,"Picking someone up is a night mare. Poorly run, no real logic, ends up taking twice as long with double the traffic. The lady the hired to yell at everyone is also useless."
6903,Strange but nice
6904,Great resource for the community
6905,"Great food, delicious omelettes!  Try adding blue cheese or havarti!"
6906,"Fun train ride on historic site,  nice way to show history of gold dredging in area. Then we got to pan for gold. While I personally didn't do well,  some found up to $25.00 worth of gold. Then, of course, they had to try to sell you jewelry to put it in. Gift shop was quaint, in all old warehouse, but disappointing,  in that most of the merchandise was from China. Still, all in all, a great experience, and worth the time."
6907,Love it here
6908,"This is a great business. Locally owned, excellent quality products, knowledgeable staff, it's one of the only places to get meat and don't kid yourself, you're only saving pennies getting that stuff from the grocery stores. Do yourself a favor and get quality."
6909,Love it here even though it's very spread out I love the stores that they have here
6910,This place is way under rated. GOOD BEERS ON TAP! Super clean and really nice inside. Beautiful art and gifts (though on the higher end of the price spectrum). Staff was amazing and helpful. I stopped by here prior to heading out of town and am glad I did. Food was delicious. I will definitely stop here next time I'm in Fairbanks.
6911,"The best Chinese food in the interior. So good I could eat my favorite dish every day. Fast service, friendly waitstaff and wonderful atmosphere."
6912,One of the only 2 places in #A*Town to get  an absolutly  incredible Philly cheese steak! Order for pick up or delivery and in 20min or less  order is ready for pick up or has arrived! They have great food at a fair / awesome price.
6913,"Excellent service, very knowledgeable staff."
6914,"I’ll never have a bad word to say when it comes to whoppers and the old school chicken sandwich .. omg onion rings, icees.. one day I wanted drive thru for the kids and myself, but no cash. I had an amazon gift card so I looked up to see if there was an e-card (can be used instantly thru email) for burger king, there was ! So I gave my my family whoppers for Christmas, uh yep I guess i did?!"
6915,Food was great and bingo was a blast
6916,"I've been going here for a while now. The baristas are always in a good mood, the coffee is always good and the service is always pleasent"
6917,Staff friendly.  Place coincidentally located.  However noisy.  Stayed here as part land component of cruise with HAL. Level 4 overlooking Carparks. Had  some guy using a blower in the multistory Carpark across the road at 11pm at night.  Then woken at 6am from a delivery down stairs.  Could hear every box thrown onto the roller converor along with the conversation around the delivery. Them the buses started a while later (taking people to or from the cruise ships)  While the room was large and clean and spacious it could do with better sound proofing. The places is owned ultimately by carnival cruises who had several billion in profits last year.. updates to the doors and windows of an old hotel would not go astray.
6918,"Friendly and knowledgeable tour guides
Really cool walking around on a glacier."
6919,Hassle free guidance rendered to the tourists.
6920,"Fast friendly service, and great ice cream for a decent price!"
6921,Good  food
6922,Some gluten-free items.
6923,Food was great and service was phenomenal
6924,Fast service with English speaking employees. Has a play area for kids under 12.
6925,"Pita Pit is a good option on this side of town. However, the price is quite expensive. You are paying for the quality of meal, but be aware that $13 for a meal is what to expect. As for the staff and quality of food, I have never had an issue with it. The $10 student lunch special during the school year is what keeps me coming back during the winter."
6926,"The tent camping sites had a nice view, picnic table and a water faucet. Checkin was easy ($25ish/ night). Clean flushable toilets, laundry and shower facilities were available too. Very close to matanuska glacier."
6927,Found what I was looking for. Saw lots to wish for.
6928,"My CT Scan was a breeze!  The doctor sent a referral, they called and scheduled, sent me a text the day before, and lick-ity split I was set.  When I arrived I electronically signed a couple documents and almost before I sat down the nurse called me back.  The procedure took a couple minutes and then I was on my way home!  How easy!  These are wonderful professional folks at Imaging Associates!"
6929,"Clean, friendly workers"
6930,"The in-person, go-to store in Juneau for the latest tools and supplies.  Very friendly and helpful staff."
6931,"Great little restaurant with friendly staff, and great food!"
6932,Yum! I had the grilled salmon and halibut tacos and we also split some Alaskan crab legs. Not cheap but everything was very good. Lots of seating especially if you are willing to share.
6933,Exellent
6934,Safeway store
6935,Food is authentic to Northern Baja I would recommend it
6936,Amazing pho there and plenty of other dishes to choose from other than pho. Although be prepared for some big bowls.
6937,"I'm probably the worst patient ever. I hate hospitals BUT after visiting the ER here, having emergency surgery and a short hospital stay I can tell you we are truly blessed to have such kind, compassionate, knowledgeable and efficient doctors, nurses and CNA's that make this hospital so great.
I have been in many hospitals in major cities and rural communities none made me feel as calm as CPH."
6938,It gets a three out of five because it's a Walmart LOL but for Walmart's it's pretty nice I mean it's in a small town so you don't have your usual City people if you know what I mean
6939,"Did a quick stop walking thru the mall. Found a variaty of typical stores. Nothing special, but noticed a large amount of inebriated people. Went especially to get a new phone, and mission was  accomplished."
6940,"It’s a good place to go and explore the arctic sea life. They explain how they take care of the rescued animals from the wild and they do research abt these animals. And if they are ready to go in the wild again they send them back in the wild. It was a good learning for my kids , they had fun."
6941,One of the best places to buy hockey stuff or to get your skates sharpened they are quick an they are friendly
6942,The movies are movies that done in big theaters. So if you missed a movie after it's done premiering. It's a great place to watch a movie if you still want to see it on the big screen. And the food there fantastic! Absolutely fantastic!
6943,"Great place to take your vehicle for dual exhausts, brakes, upgrades and such....."
6944,"The selection of products is awesome. I could spend an hour or more just looking at everything. The deals, weekly ads, coupons, and seasonal stuff is amazing.Their photo boxes are so cheap, pretty and I use them for all kinds of stuff."
6945,They were helpful
6946,"What a pleasant park setting!  Duck ponds, too (don't feed the ducks!).  Clean, inviting, well-maintained."
6947,Very nice guy. Great service.
6948,"Generally a good area for families, but need to watch out for inebriates and other people who commit crimes in the neighborhood."
6949,Best service
6950,It is cleaner than the Breeze Inn and smells better
6951,"Great food, friendly knowledgeable staff, clean restaurant, reasonably priced, must return. This will be my sushi spot!"
6952,"Great place to eat, service was excellent, burgers were flavorful."
6953,"The review for 2 stars is all about the laundry mat.

I give it 2 stars because it's the best I have come across in the area. The prices are terrible. $2.50 to wash, but the machines only hold a small load. I would guess half the size of a standard home washing machine. The ""large"" washers are $7.50 if you are using cold water, $8.00 if you use warm. WORST of all is they don't spin dry your clothes that well!! So you end up spending more in the dryers which are $0.25 cents for 5 minutes!! Again, the prices are way too much.

The place had a bad smell and it was not all that clean. Better than others in the are but that's not saying much."
6954,"AMAZING!  From fixing my car to detailing it, I cannot think of anyone better"
6955,It's a lowes. I'm pretty sure I've done a review before. Being Alaska everything is overpriced and limited stock. Order online is your best bet.
6956,Nice atmosphere.  Friendly staff and the food is good.
6957,Good food.  Reasonable prices.  The staff seemed to appreciate our business.
6958,Good fast service good food

6962,Great food!
6963,Good food but they havnt updated their online menu so some stuff doesn't exist
6964,I love this company!!
6965,Not for me.
6966,"Everything I've had from their menu has been phenomenal. From tacos to Cheesesteak to tots, it's all a good choice. My favorites are a kalbi kimchirito with tots and some bulgogi egg rolls. Service is friendly and usually fast, though they have a smaller team given it's a smaller restaurant which means they can get slammed sometimes around peak meal hours and take significantly longer than expected."
6967,Friendly staff. Good prices
6968,"You can use you're points at Chevron to get a discount of you want better gas, and it works at the full service too"
6969,Better than I expected. Clean and quiet. Playground equipment was in good shape
6970,"Great service, friendly employees, and clean environment"
6971,"They've got nice stuff and a variety of it. But they are so expensive! I like tea, I like spices but not being broke from buying them."
6972,Good bar service and nice atmosphere
6973,"Had a great time on a double date here. So-so food from the fast food place inside, but I reccomend bringing your own or eat beforehand. Video games for the kids if they get bored."
6974,very helpful staff
6975,Nice wide open beach lots of room for everyone  many grills available for bbq.
6976,"Haved loved this place forever!  Colorfull, awesome space, well trained staff, great food, drinks and management that will make the smallest thing right.  Will drive from Wasilla to Eagle River just for the mini chinils and the jalapeno cream cheese.  Chepos in Wasilla tried to replicate those but dosent even come close."
6977,Food and service was very good
6978,Need better cooks
6979,Much better view on Mt. Denali than from Denali park
6980,Small park in East Anchorage with a small baseball field and camping area. Good hill for sledding during the winter.
6981,I Love their fountain soda.
6982,"Still the best Chinese to be found in Alaska. Don't miss the Asparagus Seafood, just amazing."
6983,Very nice aquarium
6984,Not bad artisan sandwiches and 🍊 Julius drinks
6985,Most BOMB donuts in town!
6986,Allways great experience and products.
6987,"First... Our hamburgers and fries were truly amazing! ... But our experience was very unwelcoming. We ordered our dinner immediately instead of drinks or appetizers. Unfortunately our meal didn't show up for an hour and a half! The staff was not apologetic and then one of the meals was delivered incorrectly. I had to wait for the remainder of my meal to arrive while the rest of my meal got cold. Even though the food was very good, we will not return or recommend to others based on our very poor service! We were truly disappointed. Sigh..."
6988,"Want food poisoning, look no further!"
6989,Great food friendly staff clean and fast
6990,"Good people, enjoy the atmosphere."
6991,"Great Food, Awesome Service."
6992,"I love Mexico in Alaska! It's hard to tell people what is or isn't authentic, Mexico is a big country just like the USA with lots of regional variation in food, but their food is what I enjoyed in Mexico. I love their pollo frito and their molé. Better get some salsa to go! You'll want it at home."
6993,"I love Love the variety of speciality Asian foods available here. This store basically has it all. There is a salad bar, and even a mini restaurant where you can pick up Chinese takeout type food. They have a nice produce section with specialty items such as fresh shiitake mushrooms. Their dry goods are mostly Asian (rice, varieties of seaweed, sauces, canned goods etc.) but they also have a small section of Hispanic foods (beans, sauces/salsas etc.) and they carry all of my favorite Asian candy/snacks such as Pocky, rice wrapper candies, & these fruity gelatin cups. Their seafood has always been good in my experience. The last time I was there we got fresh tune that had just been flown in from Hawaii! They also have some great frozen foods like pre-made spring rolls. I SO appreciate that they have ice cream flavors not normally found in the US such as ube & buko (It's a Filipino thing.) They also carry things like rice cookers, chopsticks, sushi rolling mats & utensils, soup spoons etc. And in the front of the store is a souvenir type area with dishes, art ect. Some of the items are rather overpriced & I usually buy them elsewhere, but they have items here that cannot be found anywhere else nearby. Overall, it's a great place to shop!"
6994,Best macarons in town!
6995,To be completely honest I was surprised when we had like 3 or 4 vehicles in front of us and we were still outta there less than 30 minutes with our exact orders... I dont know if it was luck of the draw or not but it was way cool...
6996,Wonderful food and charming ambiance
6997,"One of the few shops who really have their scheduling down to a T, so theyrr quite professional in that sense. Very friendly staff. Not really the place for really picky people. Ive always loved my nails from here but I know others who have a higher demand for impeccable shape/application, which you can tell if you stare at them they have minor flaws."
6998,Don't miss it!
6999,"Convenient, clean, service...."
7000,"So much to look at, the store was very clean.  The employees were sweet,  I took my daughter in next time we won't be pressed for time you really need to look around. Prices are a bit on the high side, hard to find the price of an item but we did. I'll take my girls back but not as often as I would like to. Hopefully signing up for their rewards program and coupon will help."
7001,"Tram ride up 1800 ft above sea level. Tons of trails at the top. All levels.Some mud....
Gift store at nature trail rocks. Beautiful film inside on Tlinkit  native people. Restaurant and large gift shop upstairs. Bald 🦅 on ride down."
7002,"This is my go to place for pizza! The ranchero steak is insanely delicious. Fresh tomato pieces and fresh cilantro with a jalapeño aioli sauce for dipping!!! I like the texture of the fresh tomatoes on a few of the specialty types, as opposed to baked with the pizza. I would put it up there with some of the best ones I had in Philly and New York. The sandwiches are great and you NEVER have to wait all night for it to show up!!!
Family owned and operated by good people.
Sicily’s and Pizza Hut should take a few notes from this place!!!  If you want mass produced, market tested, cookie cutter garbage call the big guys. If you want a good pizza made fresh call Ce Ce’s."
7003,Its delicious!
7004,Quick & easy. Not busy
7005,In the middle of the city & walking distance to everything.
7006,"It was ok. I would rather go inside to look at the menu, than be pushed thru. The blizzard was good and the milkshake was all right. Kind of bland."
7007,What can I say? McDonald's is McDonald's.
7008,Nice little place. Grabbed some tea there and had a good time. Little expensive but usually worth it.
7009,Good location and great strains
7010,Great service
7011,"Such a variety of Italian and American meals with a focus on atmosphere and distinct flavors. The local beer gives want for not much else, and the cannelloni blows the experience out of the ball park."
7012,"Its a Denny's, serves was good, food was ok."
7013,Still love.this place and it's a good Lil company to work for
7014,They always have what you'll need...
7015,Good enough
7016,"Been going here for quite a few years.  I have yet to get a bad coffee.  I'm one to turn around, drive back and tell them to do it right.  Never had to do that with Brew HaHa.  I wish I could visit more often, but only going to town a couple times a month, it's more of a treat.  Thank gawd they just moved down the street, when I saw them gone at their old location, my heart sunk!"
7017,Was trying to sell baseball cards man didn't even let me get them out of the bag before saying they were worthless horrible customer service.
7018,not really a mall. More like 5 shops in one building
7019,good food and fast service. awesome employees
7020,Everything you need in the lighting and battery section plus things you didn't know they had like key fobs for your vehicle...
7021,Great place to ride and store snow machines
7022,"Very small spaces for trailers or RV, Bathrooms were clean"
7023,"Simple food, decent prices. Excellent staff."
7024,I need them so it's good
7025,I love going here! Always great deals to be had especially when you are on a budget. Highly recommended!
7026,Beautiful view and good food
7027,By far the best pizza in Alaska. We love their thin crust!
7028,Fun lots of neat stuff
7029,Great food and great ambiance. Can't wait to come back for sure!!!
7030,"Gorgeous, family-owned.  Met the son-in-law and daughter of the owner.  Fantastic people.  They did not have any accommodations for us, so the son-in-law -- even as they were operating a very popular lobby restaurant -- took 20 minutes to call hotels all across the peninsula to try to help us.  We ended up getting pizza at their ""snack bar"", which is a gorgeous facility.  I would recommend anyone looking for an authentic Alaskan Inn to stay here (just book early, because the secret about this place is definitely out!)."
7031,Love this park in the heart of down town . It gets rather windy
7032,"Enjoyed my breakfast burrito,  latte and Americano"
7033,Attentional seeking the best
7034,Best sushi ever
7035,"Although pizza we ordered was very tasty, customer service was that much poor. Last who took our order told us 40 minutes wait time, but it took them more than an hour and three reminders to finally make our pizza."
7036,"Wow, the prices OMG"
7037,"Great lunch, service could be better as there wasn't many people there."
7038,"I played pool. After inserting quarters, not all the balls roll out to rack em. Make sure to use the stick or ball to hit em out ;)
There's a nice deck area to enjoy fresh air and bean bag toss near the fence.
Bartender was amazing. Great drinks! My beer was cold and poured perfectly. Yum"
7039,Nice trails easy parking and a wonderful view
7040,"Not quite a zoo feeling, but ...not huge spaces for animal either. From what we read, they do an excellent job at the educational and conservation front. This should be reason enough to stop by this place. You can see bears very close by, but good look catching a glimpse of the more elusive creatures like the lynx or the fox."
7041,"Nice place , really crowded on Halloween,, but fun."
7042,Cheap prices
7043,"I always love coming here, as there is some different to buy. Love all the prepared dishes there. All yummy!"
7044,"Good service, excellent food!"
7045,Great company offering super service at a reasonable cost.
7046,Carlton was extremely helpful loved my experience!
7047,"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Anchorage. Great service, and always good food."
7048,Great venue!
7049,"Great great tasting food, excellent atmosphere"
7050,I normally give 5 stars to Salmon Bake but we were very disappointed tonight. We bought our dinners and added Dungeness crab. While the dinner was fine the crab was not. It was way over cooked and no salt.  Parts of it were more like jerky.
7051,Always get a quality wash coming thru here
7052,Good deals
7053,Was good they forgot a burito though!
7054,One of the best Uhauls I have used to move all over N America
7055,The all you can eat sushi is awesome. Large rolls and wide variety. They do not have beverages on tap or fountain drinks. It is a great place for destroying your diet. Lol
7056,Good food nice place
7057,"Kinda sketchy, but they have an okay whiskey selection."
7058,"This lake it's amazing
There a pullover you can take amazing pictures and see the perfect reflection of the mountains, the pullover it's on the junction of the rosd between seward and homer"
7059,"Very friendly staff, great view and the food was good."
7060,Worst boba I have ever had.
7061,"I'm from Hawaii, love h
Finding local foods here!"
7062,Huge store! Great selection
7063,Best damn bar in town it's in a book so don't take my word for it
7064,They are always so nice and sweet to my dog.
7065,Fail... pass on this place.
7066,The customer service (Dimond Location) is always above and beyond.
7067,Good reasonably priced coffee ($1.25). Really convenient for simple groceries & needful stuff. Hunting & fishing licenses!
7068,Cool place
7069,"Had a great time, this is must stop and experience"
7070,"Pretty easy to figure out where to go, places are well marked."
7071,"Had a lot if fun. It was my 1st time going. Few things they need to inform pple on when they come in and are buying beer and bowling. Like not being allowed to take ur drink to ur lane! And that it needs to be carried by an employee! They didn't tell me and I got ""chased"". Ended up waiting awhile for a lane, but once we started bowling it was great."
7072,Now that's a tasty Burger
7073,Great restraunt
7074,"My daughter-in-law was seen for a possible GERD and they came in, shook her hand, said there's nothing they can do, walked out and had her checked out"
7075,The hiking part was very doable it wasn't real steep it's very serene
7076,BEST CHINESE FOOD IN ANCHORAGE
7077,Great employees and good selection. A bit more expensive than big box stores but still nice to have such a selection.
7078,Service and staff seem ok but the customer lounge is plain and dull with a just a simple coffeemaker in the corner. Go down to Kendall Toyota if you want to get an idea on how to outfit a customer lounge area. They also give you a complimentary car wash coupon. I usually wait while having my vehicle serviced and this place falls short on the lounge which is important to me while waiting (sometimes for quite awhile).
7079,I love this place . Xalos ceviche is my go2 order but everthing is delicious. And super nice staff.
7080,Stopped for a glass of wine in the bar. Really enjoyed the atmosphere.
7081,Great food!  GREAT people!
7082,Love the food and a good Saturday place
7083,Good fair work
7084,Very quiet and clean rooms
7085,Delicious food
7086,Not a bad Carrs. Excellent Chinese food 😋
7087,"This Westmark was a clean, comfortable, and quiet place to stay for a couple of nights. Friendly staff.

The restaurant closes a little early for me, at 9pm. and there is no food available, at all after that. It would be great if there were perhaps 4 or 5 items that a bartender could heat and serve without needing a kitchen staff.

Also this hotel requires your room key to enter the building from the parking lot (not main entrance) and to use the elevator. Extra security and a minor annoyance.."
7088,"My meal was amazing,  I ain't been there in years. I had the Pasta n Shrimp Alfredo, our Blooming Onion was perfect, the bread wasn't enough though 😁, but got over it, and our server was spot on w/o being overbearing,  I like a server who knows what is to much, he was great,  regrettably I forgot his name, small pony tail and southern accent. 😉 The shrimp was perfection and the pasta was the way it is supposed to be. Definitely won't be yrs before I go again."
7089,Cheap prices
7090,Everything is to expensive and some things are overpriced and you can get cheaper at Walmart
7091,Always love to shop here
7092,Best burgers and onion rings ever
7093,"As much as I have to admit, this Walmart is okay, gotta watch the pricing though some things are less other places. Pretty good one stop shop experience although if you buy a vacuum cleaner and need to return it bring the manual and box and all the packaging with your receipt or they won't take it back. So always remember to keep the manuals."
7094,"One of the better pizza places in town. Really enjoy the Buffalo Chicken pizza.  Quality of ingredients is noticeable.  Marked down because the pick up wait times are way to long. Doesn't matter if it's a weekend or weekday, it's almost always an hour plus.  Not sure if it's a capacity issue with oven or not enough employees ... but it is annoying."
7095,Not the best. Ground beef in their enchiladas. The service was great. And the tv was on sports. So they get 3star.
7096,"Hands down the best burrito I've ever had. I highly recommend. It looks like they're under new management recently, and they've done an excellent job with the place. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu."
7097,Love it
7098,"If you haven’t had a cinnamon roll from The Bake Shop then you probably haven’t been to Girdwood. It is one of those “must eats” in Alaska. Their soups are delicious as well, especially after a day on the slopes. I love their fresh baked breads...I love just being in there smelling it baking. I can’t speak to all of the sandwich menu because I love the grilled cheese so much I don’t order anything else. Recently I purchased one of their bottomless travel coffee mugs. If you ski often it is an absolute must. Free coffee forever. Considering the quality of their food, the great attitude of their staff and the all around fantastic atmosphere of the place (especially in the garden area during the summer) -  I expect forever is not far fetched."
7099,"Best french toast ive EVER had. There is usually a wait though, so be ready to hang out for a bit, sit at the bar, or get take out"
7100,Great place for family fun. There is an indoor park and gym so you can watch your kids while you workout. Plus they have dance classes and karate for the kids. My children love the kids Zumba class.
7101,Good place
7102,A great Christian store. You can find any Christian thing you want or need!
7103,Can't go wrong with the VIB breakfast
7104,"Great place to meet friends and make new ones!  Friendly staff, great beer!"
7105,"It's Chuck E' Cheese for adults, with all that entails. Loud and fairly pricey, but DANG if it isn't a blast. Fantastic for special occasions, though it may not be worth visiting on the regular"
7106,Large soccer and football fields. It's also connected to a bike trail.
7107,"Been doing business with Young's since the 90's, Great customer service. Expert knowledge, fast and do the job right the first time. You have the questions , they have the answers.
Doug"
7108,"Fun place, probably a better summer visit"
7109,It was awesome
7110,Excellent customer service and the gal in the makeup department was definently good at matching foundation colors!! Highly recommend that part.  we took my daughter to pick a couple clothing items for Xmas and she found a few things right away that she loved! Definitely might be back for myself some clothes. They also have a decent electronics area. Nice store
7111,Food as delicious as rumored to be. Recommend highly!!
7112,"I was not able to find some of the digital coupons on the app that were advertised in the store. This place continues to be the only place in town that refuses to wipe carts down, I do not feel safe shopping here"
7113,Have had service from Alaska Waste since moving in my home in August 2017. Service has always been great.
7114,Definitly dressy very high end 70$ a plate.
7115,They carry the only food my pup will eat
7116,Nice theater
7117,Very friendly! Good food!
7118,"My family and I shared a very nice time here. The food and the service were ok, liked the atmosphere."
7119,"My wife and I went here for lunch.  We were promptly seated by a friendly hostess.  We ordered their lunch specials (which the waitress said we could mix and match some items, so i got Mongolian Beef with Chicken Chow Mein for an extra $2).  We also tried their avocado tempura which was a beautiful and delicious appetizer. We enjoyed our meal here.  It was a nice  quiet place for lunch on a Saturday at noon."
7120,"Friendly, quick, and affordable. When you don't have the time to go to mooses tooth or want delivery these guys are a cut above the rest of the major brands in town."
7121,Great place to eat
7122,Large group seating area. Private group area. Large menu.
7123,Okay. The clerk wasn't friendly or had good customer service.
7124,One of my favorite places. Prices are a bit high
7125,Best place for Wings that's close to Eagle River
7126,"If you're looking for an delicious hot meal in Downtown Anchorage then you need to eat at Bangkok Cafe.

In my opinion the soups at Bangkok Cafe will help you get over that flu faster. Not all the food here is spicy, but if you ask for spicy then you'll get nose watering spicy!

The parking is very limited, so I suggest walking here if you're nearby.  There are various sized tables, but no bar.  If you rather take your food to go then you'll have a 15 minute wait. Order ahead to save some time.

7127,Was able to check in online so i had less than a 10 minute wait. The girl who cut my hair did an excellent job! She was very informative & able to answer all of my hair questions. Would definitely get a cut from her again!
7128,Lots of variety. ALWAYS FRESH
7129,Great!
7130,"Awful customer service. I asked to speak with a department manager, so the person who answered the phone put me on hold to page him/her, and that's the story of how I was on hold for literally 20 minutes before I gave up. Oh, and this is the second time this has happened here."
7131,"We really enjoy this boardwalk every season, every year."
7132,It's an alright store. The carry a different selection of some brands than the Home Depot store.
7133,Love this place. As a hairdressing apprentice I appreciate that I can get my supplies here.
7134,Beautiful place to hike!
7135,"It's probably the best Walmart in Alaska. The one on Debarr Road is good too.

Anyway, it's a uniquely attractive building (as far as big box stores go) and the staff are nice."
7136,"I don't know what it is about this Fred Meyers but for some reason this store has the hottest girls coming here to shop, I actually come here for the views"
7137,"Buen supermercado para emergencia, es muy caro"
7138,Great buffet with a big selection. Good price.
7139,The staff is for the most part friendly. The pharmacy here is horrible. Only a drop off and pickup so the line is usually long as well as the speed in which it moves. Check out in this store is a joke as well. No matter the time there is never enough cashiers with no baggers usually so the cashier has to scan and bag. They rearrange the store few months back and now is a cluster to find things. No real flow on the layout. But again the checking out is this stores biggest weakness. They should replace the store manager since they seem to not care about customer service
7140,"Great place to stop for atvs, snowmachines, and tractor supplies."
7141,The prices are going up the meals are getting smaller but it's still Mickey Dz. Fast as fast could be though.
7142,"Eh, it's ok"
7143,Never had any problems. IDK why people are mad.  Friendly on the phone and what not 🤷‍♂️
7144,Food is awesome and very unique atmosphere.
7145,The customer service is excellent.  Was greeted as soon as I walked in the door and the price was perfect.
7146,"Gracious staff with the toddler at our table, food was good, service exceptional"
7147,Legit
7148,Best pizza ever!
7149,"I have been drawing fresh water from this creek for over 30 years.

The area around the parking lot is getting trashed because neither State Parks not the visitors understand how to maintain trails.

Specifically, there needs to be education and community involvement in order to keep the trails maintained and prevent unnecessary devastation to the vegetation."
7150,Very friendly staff
7151,Very nice place.  Good food.  Friendly service
7152,Nice place for picnic
7153,Great selection of local beers. The best shrimp & grits outside of the south.
7154,"The food here is great. definitely one of the more busy places in Palmer. If you're into craft beers, this is the place to go. Very friendly staff as well"
7155,"Amazing fast food and it was delicious, they were only accepting cash and they have an ATM. The homemade coleslaw, beans, and onion rings were awesome. And the Halibut burger was similarly awesome."
7156,"Good food and reasonably priced for the area. A  full bar offers pool tables,  dance floor and ""Giant Jenga"". The out door area offers views of the bay and a local land mark,  Bunker Hill."
7157,"A great place to sit on the edge of the Lake and watch the float planes come in just before sunset.
And if you want an adult drink, that's available too."
7158,"Great food, good portions."
7159,Good food but took almost a hour for my food
7160,The serving size is HUGE!  Good good food and friendly service.
7161,It was great
7162,Fantastic customer service and great prices!! Probably some of the best customer service experienced from any service!!
7163,Good food
7164,Very clear bar. Good food and drinks!! Just wish they had a pool table!
7165,"Friendly staff. Order at the counter,  then sit and talk, they bring the food... nice! Fantastic wheat bread Harvest Veggie sandwich. Fresh and exceptional flavor."
7166,You can find most anything at Freddies
7167,Fast friendly service great selection
7168,"The best place to find a connection to family and friends! Lived here all my life, still the best customer service, yes high internet, but still the best internet for family and for gamers!"
7169,Love it
7170,Excellent food and service! A little longer wait but very much worth it!
7171,JoAnn Fabric's is a craft store that has a large assortment of supplies and fabric.
7172,Good drinks and nice people
7173,"Amazing curry, and attentive wait staff."
7174,"Took our 6 year old riding for the first time, he loved it, will def recommend to family and friends. It was a great ride with very calm and well trained horses.
Will be back!
Thank you Joshua."
7175,Great place to buy sports cards comics and games
7176,Fun. Great pizza.
7177,Fast and efficient service with a smile 😃
7178,High price but good stuff!
7179,"Love it. Spent most of my life there. I believe in preserving it, and protecting our salmon streams."
7180,The drinks here are great; I've never had a bad experience. Probably the worst thing about the place is having to wait in line during busy times.
7181,Small lake next to the airport that has a little fishing dock.
7182,"Cheap prices, fast check out."
7183,The lady who runs the shelter was very nice &patient with us we were able to spend plenty of time to make sure that we were picking the right animal for our home she was very informative. when we went they were redoing or making improvements to the shelter with the cats stay I recommend this place to anyone They're in desperate need of volunteers I know she does all that she can for those animals that no 1 has wanted/ discarded. any future   pet i get will be coming from loving companions.
7184,Rooms were amazing. Breakfast was good but wish there was a few more options for kids and bacon is always a plus. A little hiccup with a worker but it for resolved
7185,waited at restaurant for almost an hour. expensive. WiFi costs extra.
7186,"Not sure what the big deal is here. Chicken fingers had little flavor, French fries were not much better.  The  Texas Toast was good.  The Cane sauce made chicken fingers edible."
7187,Everyone says that this restaurant is great but my family thought it was horrible and the help was rude. Maybe we picked a bad night but we will never go there again.
7188,"Knowledgeable staff. Great tea and coffee selection. Cozy location with adequate seating. Warm atmosphere. Bonus, they serve a variety of great sandwiches and wraps for lunch or breakfast. Also home for several food trucks. Great spot alone or with the whole family!"
7189,Best vet clinic around
7190,Very good Hawaiian food. Service could be a little better but the food makes it worth it.
7191,Best place for a HUGE burrito. When I say HUGE it's HUGE. I am always impressed when it comes time for the fold. Breakfast is not so much but the lunch is on point. Plus I love that it is local owned and closed on Sundays.
7192,"Ok... 😃Now under New Management and new personal..
Awesome... Like the taste and costumer service.. xx 😆"
7193,Food decent serve s friendly close to Theatre
7194,Great Stakes and excellent service
7195,Best tacos in town!
7196,Tasty treats and ice cream always ready. Coffee was ok. But it seems like the wait times get longer and longer.
7197,Not the greatest or tastiest need new better workers that makes the drinks
7198,Great place to pick up souvenirs.
7199,biggr selections than petco from what ive seen and same price ranges so nothing super great but they have been very nice and helpful when needed and have a great toy selection for dogs and very clean! Their fish selection is the best ive seen so far and the cleanest!
7200,"If you're looking for the Wilderness right in Midtown Anchorage, this is the place to go."
7201,"Since it's been remodeled a couple of years ago, it now rivals Settler's Bay for the valley's restaurant with the best view.

Others have had less than glowing reviews for the food, but we haven't had a bad experience there yet."
7202,"I've seen this a few times in the reviews and its happened to me... We've had pizza delivered before to our address (we are maybe 10 minutes away from the Wasilla store) and then all of a sudden they don't deliver to us. Person I talked to was RUDE. Needless to say, I won't order again from here."
7203,Best place for enormous portions and monster steaks.
7204,We didnt stay here but the views were beautiful!
7205,Very friendly staff. Took the bus from train depot in park to hotel. Very nice shuttle driver!
7206,This place is always beautiful. We just went up to the overlook and wandered around with the kids off the trails in the snow banks.
7207,"Its great food there my family always go there, if your gonna go with your family go there! 😃💯"
7208,Small portions for the price on appetizers.
7209,The whole case is filled with gluten free baked goods that are the best in town. I get the waffles once a week. The atmosphere is cost and the staff is great.
7210,"(Translated by Google) Beautiful town

(Original)
很美的小鎮"

7219,General grocer and household goods. Treat customers and staff reasonably well. They always seem to have what I need and their Rewards program is good.
7220,"Small, cozy, delightful. Many lose leaf teas to choose from.  Nice atmosphere.  Tasty bites and daily specials to accompany your tea selection.  You can choose your tea, your teapot, and your tea cups☺.  Places like this at common in other countries and big cities such as Montreal, but very rare and unique here.  A locals favorite.  Located at the Airport Mini Mall next to other interesting, friendly shops.  Free parking available in the front and to the left of Mall."
7221,Average Asian cuisine. Nothing really stood out. Good service.
7222,Great shop with great assortment and knowledgeable staff
7223,Good was excellent but price was a little spendy.
7224,"VERY expensive, but stand by their work! Years ago I had a bunch of stereo work done. Nearly five years later the stereo quit working. I brought it back in and they fixed it for free. This place is definitely worth it."
7225,Amazing chocolate fountain good chocolate and jams and jellies must stop by worth the visit

7245,"Really good coffee, great location"
7246,"Very great pizza, good customer service and one of the best pizza joints in town!"

7251,Always great service from Eric and staff.
7252,Great place

7255,Great customer service and knowledgable staff. They explain everything clearly. Always have a great experience here.
7256,Amazing breakfast spot.
7257,It is fun and walkable
7258,Clean and easy to locate items
7259,"The food is decent, however the sides aren't included with the burgers and sandwiches any longer. The waitress said that they lowered the sandwich prices to reflect that, but my bill seemed higher then the last time I was in when they included sides with their sandwiches."
7260,"Nice breakfast stop off. Greeted by gorgeous aromas of bakery, the rather lovely serving girl with unusual pearcings, was friendly and cute. I ordered a breakfast with additional cheese, egg and bacon... It was nice enough, but without the adds it'd have been slim pickings. I'd recommend it if only to check out the locals and work out whether having your cheeks pierced hurts as much as I think it did."
7261,We held a conference here and it was great!
7262,Awesome place
7263,This is the place to go if your looking for food that you can't find anywhere else in town

7280,I like this gym because it's spacious and never seem too crowded!
7281,"The Brew Co is awesome. I've had many of their menu items, and all of them are great. While I love their burgers, I think their wings are probably the best thing they have"
7282,"Great food, nice staff and amazing music"
7283,Amazing place
7284,"Friendly staff,good sandwiches"
7285,Kinda spendy
7286,Best French onion 🍲 ever
7287,Great!!
7288,"The spicy panini, best sandwich in Anchorage."
7289,Was nice time
7290,"One of my favorites trails. So so pretty. Best to go in late July or there will be snowy patches, ice on the lake and flooded portions of the trail. The water though is a beautiful blue and the mountains are wonderful. There is a pretty difficult boulder field to go through to get tho the lake, but most are able to go through it."
7291,Cool and affordable crafts and supplies
7292,Ok
7293,"What a great store! They carry so many of the special Asian foods that I haven't been able to find anywhere in Anchorage. I was not expecting such a great selection. So many of the items I couldn't find at New Sagaya, I was able to find here. Love it!"
7294,Great food and service!!
7295,The last time I was here was 13 years ago. The staff and the food have not changed. This is some of the best Mongolian BBQ that I've eaten. This place will continue to be on the top of my list.
7296,"We we're skeptical of the hype about Roscoe's, having moved to Anchorage from the south just a few months ago. Our skepticism was misplaced. Fantastic BBQ pulled pork and thank goodness they put enough onions on the gyros. 10/10 for sure. We will be back."
7297,Hair cut was great thank you
7298,"Allways clean. The staff are friendly and do not get huffy if you are a minute late to leave!
The hot soak is a game changer in winter."
7299,Friendliest staff ever
7300,"Good service, sometimes very busy, food can be hit or miss"

7302,Food was hot. Inside clean and restroom clean.
7303,Street Dog is a surprising good one.
7304,"Great food, made fresh on the spot for you. Something for everyone. The buffet is good too if you’re into that stuff. Wait staff is very friendly. Pretty much my go to spot when I’m hungry."
7305,Great
7306,"I went with high hopes. The best I can say is that the service was good, and the place was nice and clean. The breakfast food was not good. The bacon, for example, was overcooked and had a strange flavor that backfired on me for the rest of the day. Everything was edible, but for the price, it needed to be so much more than just edible."
7307,No complaints
7308,"Good inventory, overpriced"
7309,"The Smithsonian floor was great, and I could happily spend days there. Personally I would skip the upper floors because the ""art"" is of the""I hope they didn't waste a lot of money on that"" persuasion. Actually, there is a lovely view of the mountains from the 4th floor, so you might go up for that."
7310,"All Alaskan inside and out, VERY GOOD FOOD and nice staff. We are there often!"
7311,Great food and coffee
7312,"Garbage... Allergic to onions and such.   Asked for no onions, still have me onions.  Will never go back."
7313,Good food and good service.
7314,"Decent, nothing impressive but well worth an occasional outing as long as you don't plan on drinking the over priced alcohol."
7315,Great fun and a fun place to have an adult beverage
7316,Got finessed. Its one thing to please the customers but if you know something is going to turn out wrong then have some guts and tell the client.
7317,Good cheap smokes.. saw that they also have chewing tobacco
7318,Drive through is efficient. Seems better sfter the renovation
7319,"Great service! Even with three Thanksgiving chaos, Elisha gave fast & freindly service & the staff was knowledgeable."
7320,A great place to get parts and pieces or a whole vehicle
7321,Pricey and portions a bit small.
7322,Now we are members and it was a very easy and pleasant experience to get our member cards same day and shop.
7323,"Went once to see how the Thai food was. Not the best, pretty plain. Went again to see if it would be better. It wasn't. If you're looking for a cheap meal this is your place. Slow service, and not the best environment either. Me and a friend were tabled in a Yogurt store next door alone which was very awkward and unprofessional."
7324,Friendly people
7325,Great resource.  Especially Prince William Sound so beautiful.  Plenty of cabins to rent and boat services to charter if you wanna get out and enjoy it.
7326,Clean and friendly. Really cool model train room.
7327,Great pizzas and breadsticks! Yum!
7328,"My experience was pretty awful. I called in advance and could not reach anybody so I left a message. The message was not returned so I loaded my sick animal up and stoped in during normal business hours only to find out they are not doing walk-in’s today. That in itself sucks but it could be overlooked. The major problem was the staff was short tempered and irritated with me. I guess they must get this question a lot but it was a first for me. I found the staff to be rude, difficult to communicate with and not helpful."
7329,One of the largest military surplus stores in Anchorage.
7330,"It's a store with phones, customers, and friendly staff."
7331,Try not to drive the main road through the center. No one knows how to stop at stop signs. Can't tell you how many times I've almost T-boned someone because they think they can just California roll it.
7332,Super.good food and awesome people
7333,good Fast Fresh Food
7334,Pill snacks.  Our dog really enjoys them.

7342,It's McDonald's.
7343,Great place for all you needed alcohols.

7352,Pretty cool view and access to the beach.
7353,Family nights are great.
7354,"A very nice interior, and has 3 floors. They offer good clothing for everyday wear [socks, pants, sweaters, shirts, and hats+gloves]. They also have good winter and muck boots. There lots of merchandise that's good for the outdoors."
7355,Fried foods
7356,Zac is passionate about food and it shows in what you'll find in each of his dishes.  Quality food with the freshest ingredients.
7357,I was thrilled with the excellent service and delicious beer and appetizer.
7358,"This place is truly amazing. Award winning food, a great selection of drinks and epic views! What more can you ask for?!"
7359,Very shi**y service! I was ignored and my daughters meal took 25 min!  Many customers got their meals before her too and got waited on long after hers! Never going here again! Awful customer service!
7360,Was great until the implemented the big corporation mask policy.
7361,Delicious....as always!
7362,Great food!
7363,Lots of parking easy in and out.
7364,I checked in at 3:43pm and was out of the office by 4pm. Super fast and efficient. Lab technician was extremely nice. Made my experience amazing and I came out less nervous than what I came in . Thanks guys!
7365,Clean rooms bargain prices
7366,Not good service to several folks I talk to. No comparing to att
7367,"The store not too busy. They had the majority of what I needed. Employees were kind & helpful. I found it to be easy to go in, shop, and get back out."
7368,Awesome food and service!!!
7369,Great place to workout

7371,Very knowledgeable & friendly staff.
7372,Love this spot grate food and the staff here are very nice and there attitudes are perfect.
7373,Very nice and polite as well as great food.
7374,"Very nice fields for softball/ other field sporting activity, generous number of well-kept port-a-potties/rent-a-cans, & another plus* no unexpected wildlife encounters. The only reason I'm giving Javier De la Vega Park a 4-star rating, rather than a 5-star rating, is because of the fact that it's so well-hidden from the public's direct line of sight... (in my personal opinion: the sign should be more visible to people from the highway!)
Anyhow, I've lived here 10+ years & never even knew it was there, thank you! 👍"
7375,"Good food, nice staff, a little pricey but completely worth it. They also do a daily buffet that has a variety of delicious choices. They have a diverse menu with lots of choices. I especially like the combo meals because they serve you enough food that I had to use a to-go container because I had so much leftovers. I reheated the leftovers and had it for lunch the next day and it was just as good as the day before."
7376,Great coffee and waffles. It is clean and staff is friendly
7377,Great show place
7378,Lots and lots of good stuff.
7379,Definitely an experience! The food was really fresh tasting and our chef was great! We went right around 5pm and by the time we left an hour later they were filling up fast.
7380,Clean new store.
7381,Top place to shop for mostly all things! And its along the bus routes.
7382,Decent place. Pretty pricey for a college student but the food was alright. Nothing super special
7383,Floor has cereal on it not cleaned proper
7384,good stuff
7385,hreat service and bimbop
7386,Good pizza cheap but good
7387,"Glenn square is a nice shopping center, they have restaurants, retail stores but most importantly bass pro shops. This is really the main reason why I spend hours in this shopping center."
7388,Nice place
7389,"Waited over 20 minutes for some fries. No one wears masks, and we watched a waitress smell someones ranch or blue cheese dip then put it back on their plate and take it out to them.... gross."
7390,Great foods
7391,Sushi is really good here. Haven't tried anything except the sushi yet
7392,Our family used to enjoy ice cream here. Now they are COVID crazy people and will only serve you from a window in the ALLEY if you don't play the mask game.
7393,"Staff was very helpful getting my wife an electric cart to get around the 11 acres of beautiful flora and landscapes, is breathtaking to say the least, the head groundskeeper answered all my questions, a great place to go and relax"
7394,Good sushi and saki
7395,That's exactly what you're expecting plus Christmas-themed gifts and decorations as well as sweets and souvenirs.
7396,"I like this place they make good burgers and tacos. Their staff is awesome but they can never get my special requests right, nearly ever. I ask for light house sauce and never get light sauce."
7397,Expensive place but has things more tailored to Alaska (like bear bells to put on your dog's collar for hiking)
7398,Delicious! Down home soul food.
7399,Bought Levi Jean's fraction of the retail price ! Always buy my jeans and Summer wear tank tops to shorts
7400,Way too advanced
7401,"Great facility, and close to the library and bus line. There is a very long wait list, so I suggest that you sign up @20 years before you think you will need/want a spot."
7402,My experience w towing hasn't been the best since sometimes they unwelcomemly take your car cause you parked on a no parking zone but this time I went ditch diving because of the weather and having the towing available to bail me out the ditch was absolutely great! And such a relief to be able to get hooked up and dragged out the bad situation I was in.
7403,I enjoy the food they have to offer I dislike the fact the salad bar is so close to the bathroom.
7404,Good food a lil pricey for the portions
7405,"Good, unique pizzas.  Very popular place, be prepared to wait a long time for your table."
7406,EXCELLANT PKACE FOR DRIVE TGRU FOOD
7407,Love shopping here!
7408,"I wouldnt buy from these guys, let's just say the owners like to go on vacation alot, and when the stores are not running correctly while they are in Paris, they decide to fire people....alot of people...cut any OT and give it to the GMs ONLY. Very very rude management, and very piss poor treatment of employees"
7409,My home
7410,"I LOVE Biscuit Club! The vibe, the biscuits, the music it's all good! Did I mention the mouth watering biscuits???? There are a lot of brunch spots in Anchorage with long waits and great food. This is definitely on that list, you don't have to wait in a long line and get your hot and fresh food quickly. It's small but mighty, a must visit when in town."
7411,"Accommodations definitely need updated. Many changes since my last trip, for the better. Poor experience in the restaurant."
7412,"(Translated by Google) Very nice and clean hotel, good service

(Original)
Muy bonito y limpio hotel, buen servicio"
7413,"We’ve been residents of Fairbanks for about three months now and have eatin out about 5 or 6 times since arriving, every time we have been disappointed.  The taste just isn’t very good at the places we have tried, for whatever reason.  Couple poor taste with expensive pricing and it makes for a very poor experience.  That was certainly not the case here.  I don’t care about price, I don’t care about seating for large groups, I don’t care about cleanliness, when the food tastes this good, it doesn’t matter.  Do not miss an opportunity to check this place out.  If anyone rates this place anything less than 4 stars they are either crazy or in competition with them."
7414,Easy hike with a beautiful view. Please be careful with kids and pets as there are cliffs with no railings and parts of the trail are narrow.  If you have the chance when you get to the end of the trail walk down to the waterfall (you won’t regret it).  Absolutely beautiful hike in both the summer and winter.
7415,McDonald's is what you get everybody knows what McDonald's is about. The one in my town has been remodeled and is very nice and the drive-thru is very fast. And we all want our fries hot if you eat there. Which I barely do.
7416,We had a great time at this zoo. We went on a weekday and it wasn't too crowded. They have a wide variety of animals and open enclosures. We watched the wolverines and coyotes run around and play. The wolves also gave us a howling a acapella to enjoy.
7417,Beautiful
7418,Beer
7419,Yum
7420,The lunch combo is an awesome deal for great food and good portions
7421,Great hikes beautiful views
7422,"So I've tried to go to this location a few times since its reopening. I can say that I have become accustomed to slightly slower service and longer than usual wait times for fulfillment. It doesn't appear that this reopening has changed much of the expectations concerning experience.
At least the food makes the wait times worth it. It's still a pretty clean establishment!"
7423,Good food
7424,friendly staff and top notch atmosphere
7425,Service was great. Shrimp Scampi was mouth watering wonderful
7426,Quick service and hot food for a low price
7427,"Depends on the barista, but always great service...80% great coffee."
7428,They need to come up with a better system of getting people through the metal detectors and inside quickly.
7429,I love the service n the staff is so wonderful to be around n good on not waiting for long on my order I'd have my family come to this arby's every time
7430,Served by Chelsea. She was amazing. Excellent service. Great atmosphere. Food is awesome. Do yourself a favor when visiting Anchorage. You will not be disappointed!
7431,Try the first mate plate!!
7432,"Has turned into the Walmart you would expect in the lower 48. No longer 5 stars.

Easily the best Wal-Mart in the country. They have everything you can imagine and more, and this is big for me, if you happen to bump into someone working there, they warmly greet you and then ask how you are finding everything. It's always clean and well organized, which has to be a challenge since the do such a high volume. The checkout lines are always busy but they work through them very fast. Store associates and managers are visible and shopping is just a pleasure."
7433,"Great value, used groupon 👍
My first time ziplining.
Had a awesome time, definitely a must do in Denali.
As our guide in this fun filled tour we were fortunate to have two true professionals Rachael 🤗 and Nicolette 🤗
Thank you  👍👍👏👏"
7434,I love Wendy's. I hate this Wendy's. Don't go to this Wendy's.
7435,"Always picking up vape juice for our boy, Avi."
7436,Great place clean and safe
7437,Is amazing
7438,Good food... And one Friday night and Saturday night it's lit.... 1100...688...
7439,"The food is great, but costs a few bucks more than a competitive food chain. The place is awesome, and though not new, its kept pretty clean. Music genre seems to change day to day."
7440,Go to AT&T better reception and they are more forgiving on late payment and payment arrangement
7441,Great and authentic Mexican food.
7442,Great service
7443,superior customer service
7444,Love the service
7445,"Easy, 2 options, dumplings with meat or with potatoes. All they serve other than sodas. Super spicy, comes with sour cream. They have a record player with vinyl. Cool atmosphere."
7446,Fast easy all the time
7447,easy access to the airport
7448,Understand the importance of our non human family members. Saved my boy pug when others gave up. He's still here being a spoiled brat. 😂
7449,Service is quick and low price
7450,"Tourist stop, pretty good though."
7451,Not sure why you would come shop here.
7452,"As usual,  I wasn't disappointed with the service, it's always crappy.  My meal was almost warm and you think I could get a refill on water.  I recomend you dine somewhere else."
7453,"Great philly's, perfectly cooked fries,  chill atmosphere."
7454,The park is well maintained. A little something for everyone. A great place to bring the family. Entry is free. There's a handful of places for food and ice cream as well as a little locomotive for rides. During the summer they often feature live music and various events. Nice little tourist stop.
7455,Love this gym employees are always nice and I can workout without stress. Most machines show you what you are working on and the hydro after a workout is heaven.
7456,"Very efficient, friendly, and they go the extra because they value customer service, and satisfaction."
7457,Took people to the Helping Hands food bank at the Switzer Rec Center. The food was rotten and moldy. Most things I saw were way out dated! The woman who apparently runs it is very rude and snotty to the patrons.
7458,Friendly staff
7459,This place was much more educational than I thought it would be. The kids loved it. The baby walrus was so cute. Keep up the good work
7460,"Love their pizza, prices, and quality. I always order the stuffed Murphy. It's got everything I want."
7461,FOREST FAIR!!!!  Nuff said!
7462,Eight dollars for a haircut.
7463,Mmm
7464,Because they got good burgers in the burgers are in my zone
7465,Great deal.  Above average service
7466,Great place and awesome customer service!!!
7467,Very good Kung Pao chicken still! We used to have it every weekend back when it was on fireweed! So happy it's still delicious!
7468,Amazing scallops and a fun time.
7469,Loved the experience
7470,Can't wait for black friday
7471,Has good food choice
7472,Friendly staff.
7473,"Great experience, just got back from Vegas and needed to get my haircut before I left. Very quick and easy service. They definitely know what they are doing and I highly recommend them for a quick haircut."
7474,Besr Ribs Ever.
7475,"Been doing business with them for awhile. Parts prices and apparel prices are pretty good.  Parts people are friendly and normal very knowledgeable. They even went out of there way to help me figure something out on my quad. Sales people are also friendly and helpful. My only problem i'v had is the service dept. The older guy that works the front caused me some big headaches. But, the owner made it right with me. I was happy in the end. All in all, I think there pretty good. I still will get parts and riding gear there. I think next time I need something worked on, I'll go elsewhere."
7476,Good food.  Order ahead and pickup.
7477,These guys were able to get me in right before they closed. Very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend!
7478,It took 25 minutes to get our order and they're twice as expensive as they are in the lower 48. What is up with that we expect to pay a little more but that's ridiculous
7479,Unique cafe. Great place to stop by for coffee and also some food.
7480,Easy enough to find things.
7481,"Five star hotel and deserve. Everything is clean and high level.. Few steps to Safeway, Fred Myer, and midtowen."
7482,"Always good coffee, always polite baristas."
7483,"Watch out for dog poop, dog owners all over Juneau take their dog here to poop every day."
7484,"Fast, clean, consistent. Considerate service. Coupon deals and what I consider good fast food. Options top the competitors menu IMHO."
7485,Perfectly decent hotel with a nice view of the mountains and the harbor.
7486,Huge store in the bonnies of Alaska
7487,Wide ocean front sites. What a view!
7488,Nice place to get cheap stuff. Terrible bathrooms
7489,"(Translated by Google) A challenge between two teams of lumberjacks, Canadian and American, which turns into a typical American show with lots of cheers and buuuu from the audience divided between the two teams. Surely too expensive for an hour of show.

(Original)
Una sfida tra due squadre di boscaioli, canadesi e statunitensi, che  si trasforma in uno show tipico americano con tanto di cori di incitamento e buuuu dal pubblico diviso tra le due squadre.  Sicuramente troppo caro per un' oretta di show."
7490,Kool
7491,Awesome sawce
7492,I REALLY had 2go
7493,Excellent staff and dining
7494,Fun to visit. Check out the reindeer!
7495,"Run by Holland America so very well run, clean and organized.  Food in site decent but expensive.  Small nature trails along Nenana river.   Wildlife tour at night very short but informative"
7496,"Bishop""s Attic is a great place to bargain shop . The $5 bag sale is a awesome way to get clothing on a tight budget. They are also known to help people out in need and donate to several places such as Love Inc. ect.  The shopping experience is always pleasant  they have a wonderful friendly staff that will help you locate anything you need in the store. I recommend going and checking Bishop's Attic out."
7497,We saw whales and porpoises too
7498,Trailed are well maintained and signage for possible dangers are always posted.
7499,"Matt Feichtinger at Kendall Ford Anchorage sold me a wonderful Corolla and made the buying process real smooth and simple. Straight forward, no bullshit. 5/5"

7510,"The sports screens were cool, but the food needs improvement and most the games were way too expensive."
7511,"As a person raised in Arizona and Southern Colorado, I greatly appreciated having an authentic taste of Mexican food all the way up here in Alaska. I had a great burrito supreme with carne asada and a Dos Equis. It was wonderful as was the atmosphere! Definitely recommend!"
7512,Fast concessions stand.
7513,Good
7514,A new concept on the theatre experience I walked away from years ago. Good food & good movies. What's not to like.
7515,Nice place to go if you're a tourist.
7516,"Nice stylists, fair prices, but long waits.  Use mobile app is my recommendation."
7517,"Very nice hike, in winter or summer.
Would recommend it to anyone that like to hike.  It's kinda easy but I guess really depends on what you think is easy."
7518,Great rain forest trail. Take bus or taxi to University. Trail starts back of university parking lot and you wind up back downtown.
7519,"I've lived in juneau for 8 years and finally went here for a meeting a few months ago. I asked for a substitution of no cheese and  no sour cream,  but with guacamole instead, was charged 5.50 for a tiny side of average tasting guacamole... this is americanized Mexican food, if you want real Mexican food, go to Mar E Sol."
7520,Nice hike! However I wouldn't say this is a easy hike in any way! It was up hill most of the way if not all! And the view wasn't that great.
7521,The best steaks ever
7522,"Excellent, efficient service. I called around 2 pm, made appointment for 3:30 pm and was out in less than 15 mins (fixing a small crack on windshield). Very friendly, professional stuff! I've been going to Novus for years and have ALWAYS had only positive experience."
7523,Our family had so much fun
7524,Pizza is too expensive . Long wait. Not very hygienic place.
7525,"Amazing food, just expect a bit of a wait and a tight squeeze it's a small place 😊"
7526,Great staff. Good coffee.
7527,"Great food, Quick delivery, friendly staff"
7528,Nobody asked to help me and they didn't have what I needed in the fishing gear place.

7531,Good old fashioned saw shop!
7532,Big tables

7534,"Good prices, fun selection, if looking form farm/country/homestead feel perfect place!"
7535,"Food tastes great, always hire friendly employees, but way over priced for how small their portions are.  (Excluding beef n cheddar)"
7536,"Great location. My family loves the Cris Cut fries. Customer service is better here, than the McDonald's location down the street."
7537,Wow! It is everything a park should be and more 😁
7538,Very crowded but yummy food
7539,"Convenient location in town, Everything close."
7540,Be prepared to encounter other enjoyers when the weather is great
7541,Nice motorbike and ATVs.
7542,This place has great Chinese food. I think the Mongolian beef & the Kung poa chicken is the best in Anchorage.
7543,Fast and accurate diagnosis of my truck's problems.  Made several repairs all in one day.  Perfect wheel alignment done; the truck tracks very straight. Explained remaining problem with power steering.  Honored parts warranty.
7544,Did a good job.
7545,"Prices are fair, help is around the corner when u need it"
7546,"I love the raceway park! They dont just do race's they hold other events here too. Like concerts, food truck fest, and other community events as well. Staff is always friendly and courteous."
7547,"Are you kidding me? This place is awesome! To be honest Indian food isn't my top choice, but the lady loves it and I thought I would do a pick-up order. To my surprise this place is wonderful! Placed order and was ready for pick-up in 20 minutes. Especially right now it's great to help local businesses. Price wasn't even that bad, for what we got!

Chicken Tikka Masala with Cheese Naan you can't go wrong!

Will be back again!"
7548,Clean
7549,Great place! Good sandwhiches
7550,"Wish I could give this a half star because 4 seems too low but it's not quite 5 stars in my opinion. Spinache artichoke dip was great, the south of the border pizza (i didn't have any meat) was tasty. I would definitely come again. Beer selection is only in 22 oz or other bottles not tap, but they are all local which is highly redeeming. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
7551,"Clean, modern, and close to everything!"
7552,Best calamari in Anchorage.  Never crowded.
7553,The car wash seems to always leave stripes on my car. I love it that your so close.... but... ugh
7554,This mall has my favorite shops. The wifi is virtually useless and there is only one bathroom very inconvenient!
7555,Great place to work out. There are certain days that are much busier than normal but most of the time there's plenty of room to do your own thing.
7556,"Mediocre food but the server was nice. My wife and I had the calamari, fish and chips, and spaghetti alla livornese. The seafood in the spaghetti was extremely overcooked and chewy. The calamari and halibut were cooked perfectly but were too greasy. I also got a birra Peroni.  After tip, we spent about  $90 for the meal."
7557,"We wouldn't even give them the 1 star.  Paid for a living room set. Upon delivery the sofa was broken.  We can't get it replaced or returned. Out the money and have a sofa that arrived as garbage.  They delivery company they use are worthless as well.  It took 2 days and they still missed the delivery window that they assigned and still was 3.5 hours late. 8:30pm. Brian at Bailey's said they would swap out the sofa. No show. 24 hrs later a truck shows up with a love seat ti swap. Um no its a sofa.  Well after a call to Brian he has the to bad so sad we can't get you what you bought.  4 sale new broken fresh from the factory sofa just a 1000 dollars.  This could be you too.  Also, never a phone call as promised.  We had to call and hunt down peopleon every step of this process from the beginning."
7558,Rodney helped me with a samsung trade in phone offer and got me on a plan that helps lower cell phone plan costs through ATT.
7559,Was overprice for what you get to eat.
7560,They always run out of food here.  It's not cheap to be a lounge member and this is the poorest lounge for any eating.
7561,"Line was long , cashiers slow and leaving customers in line and leaving register areas at one time only 2  registers open , spend 20 minutes in line and not everyone practicing 6 ft distance , cashiers wearing mask with their nose out and not customer service friendly !"
7562,Excellent food. Recommend to visit and try creps there! Get both savory and sweet - meal and dessert. 5+
7563,"It's got a great view and the food was so,so. Service ok..I guess not bad for a roadside dive.."
7564,"They are awesome, always great work at reasonable prices. Walt is my favorite...always super nice!"
7565,This is a fun tour! Loved it!
7566,Great for breakfast. Haven't tried lunch.
7567,"No you can't have visitors, but when we were air flighted to providence the staff was very open and communication qas open and to the point. They took amazing care of my son the entire time,listened to my concerns and worked with me the entire time♡"
7568,Lots of gardening supplies
7569,"Came in later afternoon on a Saturday, was quiet only a few patrons in the place.  Outdoor tables were empty, it was a little chilly.  With covid, everyone kept their distance and staff was properly protected.  Dinning area is marked and signage indicates expectations, which were followed, generally.

Food was fantastic.  The sourdough bread crusts up nicely for a great crunch.  All sandwiches in the group were great.  Great spot for a stop anytime of year.  They have hearty soups to knock out the chill and breads and sandwiches to fill you up.  Highly recommended."
7570,Came for the tacos left with diarrhea. Would visit again!
7571,Good service
7572,"This is a good, clean store. It is a lot less crowded than some of the other nearby stores. The meat and seafood departments always have a great selection and the staff is helpful. There are a lot of choices for pre-cooked meals. My only gripe is that they really need more self-checkout isles. There is almost always a line waiting to use them."
7573,Sludge!
7574,Expensive
7575,I buy all my vinyl here.
7576,Local number but transferred to call center. Over 20 minutes on hold before i gave up. Have no doubts could of scheduled in less time had i been able to speak to local shop. So decided my time is worth something going to Speedy Glass.
7577,I used to go here every day with my friends great place to go for some snacks!
7578,Nice place
7579,"Not like there are a lot of choices. They have what I need, so they get my business."
7580,Delicious coffee and tea. Thanks for a great experience!
7581,Love KFC chicken.
7582,Beat part of the hitch! They always get me home safe!
7583,"Nice place, good coffee and very reasonable prices."
7584,"However, due to the times, it was different. The staff was excellent. The service has changed . All things considered, it was an excellent experience."
7585,Best hole in the wall burger stop I've ever been to. Had it on my birthday and it was the highlight of the day
7586,Tommy's is the go-to lunch option for anything burger in Anchorage! Awesome service and great food always keeps this place busy.
7587,Great place to shop
7588,Has expanded considerably since my previous visit. But the food/coffee/service continue to be top notch. Definitely worth it!
7589,"Food is always awesome.. Staff is always a little laid back, but always friendly and helpful."
7590,"Outstanding place to buy clothing, boots and even better customer service"
7591,Was really nice stay
7592,Best pizza in Alaska!
7593,They have great holiday gatherings
7594,Great historical ride through the mountains
7595,Loveit
7596,Such a relief to shopping here comparing very old Napa and Carquest in town ... very helpful staff thanks a lot keep it up guys
7597,Great place to visit and learn. Self guided tours through the buildings. Gold panning is allowed if you bri g your own pan and shovel. A nice hike around the property and wonderful views of the surrounding mountains.
7598,"This is the Wendy's I goto in Anchorage. Fun staff, fast service, and they're never out of frosty's."
7599,Nice lil park mostly 4 baseball
7600,Good service
7601,Great prices an excellent costumer service.
7602,"We had some amazing guides , with Gale , Sam and clay ! It's definitely a family friendly adventure, you get to see some great views just outside the park ! It's definitely a fun relaxed if not a little bumpy and dusty tour! (Also Bob the bus driver is a hoot!)"
7603,Place was filthy.  Looks like it has not been cleaned since it opened. Out dated and needs a lot of repair.  Bathrooms where in such disarray that we where afraid to use them. All male workers where there when we went and all had long unkept hair that was so nasty. It was the most disgusting place i have ever been.
7604,"Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's good. Tuesday night tacos and Wednesday night open mic are highlights for sure."
7605,It was food. It was fast. It was exactly what I was expecting.  Hard to beat that.
7606,good food when you can get a table  to eat at
7607,Friendly and informative staff
7608,Friendly people would go back
7609,Best spot to fish or just ride bikes to.
7610,"Awesome. Seats are clean and separated for social distancing as soon as you buy them. Price is fine for two ($25 for tickets, $15 for a medium popcorn, a soda and water)."
7611,"Really amazing desserts. Had a sausage breakfast sandwich, wasn't entirely in love, but my friend thought it was amazing. The carrot cake and fresh berry trifle was to die for though. I also bought a banana rum cupcake, which I gave to a friend as a gift. I would go back for it though because it still looked amazing."
7612,Great southern food😍😍😍
7613,"Great service, love Brian he's wonderful, very nice and understanding.  Kyle and Zoey at the front desk do a great job their  very nice and welcoming. I also seen Gail a couple times and she is great as well. Awesome team, i would recommend this clinic to anyone with chronic pain.Thanks guys👍"
7614,"There is excellent potential at Millers Landing for a new example to be set in the way of 21st century EcoBusiness that yields millions of dollars in revenue while restoring the Natural state of the land and ecosystem.

""Working Vacations"", Stewardship Projects and being the primary base in Alaska for several upcoming Motion Picture Films about People and Nature.

Multi-millions of dollars have been earned in this small Alaska town by very successful businesses like Millers Landing.

Now, with more and more people of all ages seeking a more meaningful and enjoyable Alaska ADVENTURE rather than a tourism propelled cattle drive, the sudden and extreme drop in tourism can be replaced by a more ecologically and therefore Economically sound business of Education - Stewardship - and Production... putting people to work caring for the Land, Trees and Water, Trails, shoreline, riverbank.  They are can really use some stewardship.

A whole new industry is born that is mutually beneficial instead of mutually assured destruction.

We destroy Nature, She destroys us.  We care for Nature, She cares for us.

Millers Landing is the best place in the world for this to begin."
7615,My brother and I live 5 min away and we go to the location on Tudor. This location is not worth it.
7616,"Lived here for a bit.  Nothing that special, but a little more affordable than Anchorage.  The drive can be a real pain if you work in the city."
7617,Awesome 👍 gotta get there
7618,It's pretty much what you expect from drive through
7619,Great fresh burgers!! And you can enjoy a beer with your meal.
7620,The circumstances behind my dealings with animal house was full of lies and uncertainties. To prevent more negativity about animal house I will let my rating speak for itself and I will never use or recommend animal house to anyone.
7621,"Friendly service, good food"
7622,Rainbow sprinkles on hot chocolate ;)
7623,"One of our go-to spots to dine when we're in mid-town.  An excellent ever-evolving menu with daily specials and that great Broken Tooth Brewing beer, I've never had a bad meal or bad experience there.  The only downside is the wait at dinner times, (no reservations), and in the winter there's not much room inside for queuing up.  But, overall, highly recommended."
7624,"No you can't have visitors, but when we were air flighted to providence the staff was very open and communication qas open and to the point. They took amazing care of my son the entire time,listened to my concerns and worked with me the entire time♡"
7625,Really good pizza. Always a must stop when passing through girdwood.
7626,I ordered the Spicy Lemon Pepper wings.  (Combo #1 with seasoned fries + celery and carrots for $1 extra).  Everything came out fresh and delicious.  Looking forward to trying the other flavors.
7627,"I have a soft spot for these guys. I love the building exterior and they are a friendly group of people. For a basic carwash and a stop at the espresso stand in the parking lot, they are great."
7628,Great customer service
7629,Had a great first experience. The staff were friendly and great conversations and decent prices.
7630,A little busy but nicely priced
7631,Great place to hang out come here all the time good food good drinks great staff
7632,It was pretty nice
7633,"American asain food
It was hands down the best Mongolian beef i ever had"
7634,Friendly & courteous staff; needed a tire changed quick and they made it happen tho I wished the would have balanced it also for the price but all in all they were great.
7635,So fun!
7636,We love Wendy's burgers. They are messy just like a burger should b. You can that they don't freeze there hamburger. Wendy's is my favorite Burger Joint.
7637,Food is good as is the atmosphere.
7638,Goldin arches
7639,I did not go in! And it's kinda hard to find the parking lot and the front door.  Also The people that work there seem to be unfriendly!
7640,"Really fast, friendly service.  Priced right."
7641,Remodeled!
7642,So lost everytime I see a worker they turned and walked away had so many questions in store over an hour n no help
7643,Great Mexican for Anchorage
7644,We were impressed by the variety of ivory carvings and scrimshaw artwork from both Alaska Natives and non-natives. Also there were antique furniture and other historical items that one could use for anyone or business. Definitely worth a trip to review the current inventory.
7645,No fish here try another creek
7646,Great food as usual
7647,Verry fast
7648,Great family barber shop. Great prices and friendly service
7649,Has good low cost but they have rodents running around every where and bugs. They do not give refunds at all!
7650,I dont know why I go here. They only supply products that the wealthy can afford. Nothing for people on a budget there.
7651,The pretzel bun is so bad I threw it in the trash after gagging down 1 bite.
7652,"Not a bad place, not a great place. Good food large beer selection, full bar. Nice people, nice clean restaurant"
7653,"Kim is a wonderful Korean lady. She is always very professional and friendly. Brought my Navy dress blue uniforms in to be cleaned, which had been cleaned in some time. Kim had them looking brand new in no time. Amazing work. Fantastic prices. Thanks Kim!!! Definitely my go-to dry cleaners. Worth driving across town .Have recommended to all my friends."
7654,Worth the visit. Lovely place to see
7655,Conveniently located near the airport.  Airport parking next soor.  Restaurant on the premises.  Rooms are clean and staff are friendly.
7656,Good pizza
7657,Beautiful spot to have coffee or lunch and talk with locals!
7658,"We took the kids to see Wonder Woman yesterday. The theater was clean, prices great, and the popcorn was delicious."
7659,Good
7660,"Great beer, food, and atmosphere"
7661,"The only almost real indian restaurant in Fairbanks.
Quality is not bad but the prices compare to the quantity of foods is in the sky.
A small goat curry( half a normal portion for a normal person) is 22 dollars!!!!
If you want only indian restaurant and you have a lot of money to spend, it is a good option."
7662,Great time 🤣
7663,great place
7664,Store layout is a little bit confusing
7665,"A wide range of supplies.  Hardware automotive, fishing gear, you name it they probably have it"
7666,"Nice, clean rooms"
7667,Iij t was awesome seeing all the animals
7668,I love this craft shop and all the deals I can find.
7669,"Knowledgeable wait-staff and delicious food. It's quite busy so I recommend making a reservation, which they only take the day of."
7670,"The visitor center is pretty small for such a big tourist hot spot, the drinking fountains have the nicest filtered water dispenser I have ever seen lol"
7671,Wonderful coffee and staff!!!
7672,Rooms were clean with full kitchen and small living room with separate room for the bed. Bathroom also.
7673,"They're quick, friendly, and food is amazing! Kaluha pork is exceptional"
7674,This place quite possibly one my heart when it comes to a beer. The Brew is phenomenal there I'm not quite sure if they make the room or not they probably do more than likely but it's a laid-back atmosphere and your classic moose Hunters go there to hang out
7675,Big selection at great prices.
7676,Must renew membership. Great place!
7677,Love it!
7678,"Best clam chowder in Fairbanks, but I like their roast beef on croissant even more."
7679,Favorite breakfast joint
7680,Great lunch place.  Great owner
7681,Great customer service.
7682,Lots of nice boots in there will be going back
7683,Wasn't there. Was at state fair.
7684,"I love the Eagle River Walmart. I wish they had built us a bigger store, but still very happy to have it here and not have to drive to the city."
7685,Fast Convenient and Honest
7686,"It's okay, games are a bit of a bust, but for a child it's heaven lol"
7687,Amazing views from the mountain
7688,Great help! Thanks Sam
7689,Great Prices on all there menu.
7690,An excellent Anchorage park for all seasons.  Trails for running and biking in the warmer months.  Wonderful xc skiing trails in the winter.  Lighted skiing paths make early morning skiing the perfect time to get away from everything.
7691,"There is a veritable bevvy of donuts to choose from this locally owned bakery.  Their prices have crept up consistently over the past 2 years and they don't always include a bakers dozen when you buy a box.  That being said, they are a quite treat for the occasional pit stop and to share with friends."
7692,Nice church in a beautiful location
7693,Did a great job on 5th wheel trailer axles.  Thanks Tom an teem.
7694,I have never been to this location. However I called them and asked what type of vegetable starters they have and the lady on the phone sighed heavily and said she has no idea what she has but they have lettuce. Terrible customer service from this experience. You should be eager to help all customers and ready to answer questions. You should also know enough about your inventory to tell someone more than “ we have lettuce “.
7695,Nice sports ware.
7696,"Clean, quick checkout, friendly staff"
7697,"Possibly the best Chinese food in town,  I've never been in when they aren't crowded.   If you go to late in the day they start to run out of things.  I want tp try their cake,  ot seems like they sell a lot of birthday cakes."
7698,Maintenance man was very helpful and professional..( believe his name is Russ)
7699,Nice park but it's next to Muldoon bus depot. So exhaust odors and homeless and inebriated in area.
7700,Beat place for tires on the Matsui Valley.   Top notch.
7701,I really enjoy their pulled pork sandwiches with sweet potato fries.  They have great craft beers  on tap is well.  I love whenever a sour is available.  The Twister Creek IPA Is a go to classic however for those who enjoy the hoppier side of life.
7702,"Love their french toast, sausage and over easy eggs. The service was great!!! I recommend this place for anyone who wants a good breakfast!!!"
7703,Even if I see a long line here it's not a deterrence because they are quick & efficient at what they do! I've never had bad service here & I love that the food is always fresh & delicious!
7704,"I think it is ""Lisa is coming so let's mess up her order"" type restaraunt.  Went Friday to get sausage biscuits for my crew, asked for grape jelly and they give me strawberry.  I always get a large French vanilla coffee; it is always a surprise.....ice coffee barely any ice, taste just like cold coffee, maybe forgot to put the vanilla, and barely any cream. It's like this every dang time.....here comes Lisa screw up her order. Yet, I go back for more hoping they get it right that day........"
7705,Nice atmosphere. I liked the tall booths and the Indian tv was fun to watch. The service was a little slow but well worth the wait.  The kabobs were delicious.
7706,They have good sales
7707,Coors light.
7708,Great facility.
7709,New bartender. Not sure now
7710,So pretty
7711,Great pizza and local name for years. The subs are pretty damn good if I might add
7712,"Today, great waitress in the bar area. Very good service and, as always, good food"
7713,This a great place to go! Staff is friendly and food is great. There is a full bar with unique mixed cocktails and plenty of flat screen TVs to accommodate different sporting events and a family friendly dinning area that can entertain large groups that come with no reservations.
7714,Quirky and fun.
7715,Very pricey but good. Need to update the outside appearance because it gives the impression that the inside is a dump.
7716,Great salads!!
7717,"The manager, Rob is a rude, arrogant self entitled man with little man syndrome.  He belittles the crew in front of customers with kids. His attitude and demeanor totally  ruin every experience i have there.
The crew is great, great fast yummy fries, with great service."
7718,Great staff small town feel. The food was also surprisingly good especially considering how far you are from anything else.
7719,Great place. Very helpful employees!
7720,"Kava's off of Muldoon has good food, and a good selection"
7721,Good food and friendly customer service
7722,"Love it, great food but not stuffy, huge beer selection"
7723,Was a very classy restaurant but with a comfortable feel. Travelers can go off the road dusty and still feel comfortable
7724,"I’m giving them a five but do wish it was a little warmer for spectators. I know, what kind of Alaskan complains about the temperature in an ice rink? Just layer up, bring a blanket to sit on and get some hot cocoa at their concession stand (not always open, so a thermos from home works too). Ice is at a premium in Anchorage and Dempsey Anderson helps meet the need. Very conveniently located in the Spenard/Turnagain area. I’m here watching the Chugiak/Eagle River HS girls hockey team skate against Service/East. It’s always great fun to watch strong young women play! This rink is part of Anchorage’s long hockey history and I’m sure Mr. Anderson would be proud to see that his dedication toward engaging youth in the sport has continued."
7725,"Recently I bought a new Yamaha YZF-R1. I immediately noticed that the motorcycle was having a hard time cold starting. After a couple of visits of going down to the Anchorage Yamaha dealer, and accomplishing nothing... I decided that my time is more important to me. I reached out to the Battery Specialists of Alaska and spoke with Mike. It's absolutely incredible, that they had a lithium battery with 220 cold cranking amps in stock for my R1. A few hours after purchasing, I installed it and noticed a huge Improvement. Mike at Battery Specialists of Alaska was awesome, and provided exceptional service in a timely manner🙂👍"
7726,"Empty, seemed like more of a tourist attraction than its reputation let's on."
7727,"Was a delightful place. I have no reason I can really fathom to give a place where you can observe and learn about sea life like this anything less than five stars. A little chilly inside, but otherwise a great place to visit if you are traveling through."
7728,So welcoming to new cyclists!
7729,Cheap and fast
7730,"A nice park located in downtown Anchorage. Open and fitted with several historical monuments. Though the park is fairly nice, there are some parts of it that are little run down and old. Occasionally you'll find a interesting individual roaming the park, but for the most part it's pretty safe and nice."
7731,Best coffee in Anchorage period.
7732,"The Ruben here is in a class of its own, I would recommend the 9oz."
7733,Good food fast.
7734,"(Translated by Google) Everything you need except decent baguette

(Original)
Alles was man braucht, außer ordentliches Baguette"
7735,Good
7736,Not going back. Service was horrible. Waited 2 minutes to be greeted and she left to do the drive through in the middle of making my food. They also charge 2.00 for a salad. No bread and a .10 bowl. Definitely not 2.00 worth!
7737,"Vagabond Blues is one of the only places in the Valley that provide vegan options. There service is great, the employees are friendly, wonderful snacks and food! It's the perfect, small town coffee house! Also, more vegan options, please! :)"

7750,Awesome family fun
7751,"Great food, this is an awesome place to meet for lunch!"
7752,Great place for our pets
7753,"The hike itself is wonderful, amazing views and a fairly easy trail. Should have done a bit more research because I did NOT expect it to be that long, about 13 miles around. HOWEVER, there is a sign dictating the rules before you enter the trail, dogs must be on a leash. If you have a dog that is well behaved enough to not have to be on a leash, that's awesome, but they still need to be on a leash OR be leashed when another group/dog is coming. This was an awesome trail for my little Yorki/Shih Tzu, who enjoys hiking and saying hi to other dogs from a short distance. My dog is a spaz but we'll behaved, but he's also extremely small and cannot handle an unleashed 80 pound dog running straight towards him, which happened with about 6 out of every 10 dogs. He was constantly freaking out and I had to pick him up more than once because the owner of the dog either wasn't there yet, or didn't have full control of their dog. At one point a medium sized dog ran from behind us and started barking at my dog and the owners, a ways behind, did nothing. My dog started retaliating, so I just picked him up when the owners finally said ""yeah you can just pick him up and we'll go around you"". Completely awful experience in that department. If your dog is well behaved enough to not be on a leash, then they are well behaved enough to be on a leash for 60 seconds while we pass by. There is no excuse for that, so please keep your dog leashed moderately and be mindful of other animals."
7754,Not a bad place to eat
7755,"I prefer to stop here over the clown act at ""The Hub"". I usually can pull right up to a pump, get diesel from EVERY diesel pump without needing a corporate card, and can use a functional, clean restroom AND have actual water and squeegees to clean my windshield. To top it off, they are usually lower by a couple of cents than every other place in Glennallen."
7756,Favorite place to shop!
7757,Highway noise echos across the lake. Very clean & well set up
7758,Really nice coffee and cozy environment

7760,Nice hotel. 13 story building. Small balconies. Good location in downtown Anchorage.
7761,Clean and so well organized. Some of the best produce in town. One of the few grocery stores with a such good cheeses. I think of this as one of the premier grocery stores in town. The clothing and household goods tend to be pricey but of good quality. Customer service is pretty good.
7762,Great place for a military lodging
7763,"I find the Palmer Midas to be the most professional auto shop in the valley. In addition to their straight forward information, they are honest, efficient and fairly priced. I’ve had all of my service performed by Midas and have each time been sincerely satisfied."
7764,"Ordered beef chalupa supreme and was given chalupa but no beef at all. Was too late to return order. Also I had to go back inside building because they forgot to add extra sour cream on side order of nachos. Usually this location is ok for quick meal, but come on to forget a main ingredient."

7774,"Much better than mcds and burger king and the like.. great for a chain. A bit more expensive but the food is more substantial and more flavorful. As well as being better prepared. Makes it worth the bit of a price increase. Just bring an appetite or maybe think about sharing truth a friend of significant other.. it's genuinely difficult to finish a whole meal.. and even though it's cheaper fast food, I still hate wasting it.."
7775,"The FOOD was terrible, don't waste your money, seriously. We ordered soup and the soup was cold. Looked like soup from a can, just nasty. Sandwiches were yuukk! You walk in and it's just not up to par. Can't even figure out the menu, it's all over the place."

7803,"Friendly staff and good treats. I especially enjoy the free tea when I visit. Cakes are higher quality and therefore more expensive, so don't get too much sticker shock when walking in."
7804,"1st time home owner, never had my chimney cleaned or inspected.  I called and got my appointment setup for a week out, cleaners came out, inspected and cleaned.  They quoted me a higher price initially but reduced it because my chimney wasn't really dirty!  The crew that came out was great, professional, and informative about the process.  They even gave me extra advice on the house we were looking to buy.

Overall a great service by a great local company.  If I was to ever have bad news with a chimney, I'd want these folks to give it to me - they are honest and strive to do the right thing."
7805,Excellent food! Great service! Amazing pizza!
7806,Expensive and not great customer service.

7835,This place ROCKS!  Way cool locals eatery with WOW Fresh food and great coffee and Lattes too!
7836,"It seems like it's a nice spot to eat. Unfortunately there were a few things that made it kind of something you won't go back again for. The menu is huge and overwhelming. The staff was great but we really felt bad having to ask for more time to look through the menu, and both my partner and I finally just panicked and picked the one thing that stuck out to us that was familiar. We got the pad thai. It was alright. I was kind of disappointed that it seemed wet or soggy. The bean sprouts were wilted in with the dish. It came with a quarter slice of lime which isn't really enough. The chicken had a weird off taste to it...it might have been on the edge of off. It would have been great if the sprouts, lime wedge, and maybe some cilantro had been served on the side so you could mix them in and get that really nice fresh cool crunch with the noodles. It seemed a bit greasy too. We got the cucumber salad and it was like eating butter bread pickles and not at all what we expected. Extremely, overwhelmingly sweet. Not something we're used to at a Thai style restaurant. Unfortunately nothing really noteworthy. Just kind of bland and a bit off."
7837,Dr Ravenswaay was simply amazing! I done the online Dr's visit just needing some refills on my meds. I'm in Anchorage from Ga and ran out. He was so attentive and nice. If I wasn't going back home this would definitely become my regular Dr's office.  Even the staff were so helpful and kind. So greatful I found them.  Highly recommend.  Wish my dr in ga was more like this dr!

7850,My husky had an urgent medical condition crop up in the middle of her grooming. They notified me right away so I could get her to the vet immediately and took great care of my samoyed while the husky was at the vet. I'm so thankful to them and I'm pretty sure my Sammy was 10 pounds lighter with all the fur they got out of her coat.

7858,"It’s unfortunate when an out-of-state company makes an in-state company look so terrible, GCI is right across the street... MTA has continuously disappointed me and is highly avoidable. This company is lazy they do not care about their customers or this state, we don’t have many options but I wouldn’t choose this one. I would not recommend anyone I know use this service or company in any function whatsoever."
7859,"I been there yesterday.. before make a complain go and volunteer! Of course smells like 💩 , this lady is alone doing her best with a lot of feral cats and dogs, all of them have food and water, I'm in the US army so I won't pass out for a little smell, she was polite and educated all time, and any other animal shelter charge the double for any pet, also she gave me a cage and a litter box for free. I don't care if the cat that I adopted is sick or too skinny I will try my best to give her a better life now."
7860,Good inventory
7861,They help a lot of people. They also help coordinate other resources.
7862,Great shop. Good prices. Great staff. The monstrous Carolina Reaper plant definitely caught my attention. Now I'm excited to grab some pepper seeds from this fine establishment and have my own small garden this year. I definitely recommend this place.
7863,Ocean view
7864,"Great service, happy employees"
7865,"Great place to stay in Valdez, Alaska. The property is right on the water next to the harbor.  We stayed in room #100 which was a corner room with a jacuzzi and fantastic views. The staff were all very friendly and professional.  The continental breakfast was very nice and had hot food like fresh scrambled eggs, omlettes, sausage, biscuits+gravy, and of course cold things like cereals, yogurt, etc. It seems that they also rotate the menu a bit day-to-day.  Overall, very impressed and would definitely come back again."
7866,"They are always so honest and fair on pricing, plus they give a military discount. These guys are great because if nothing is wrong, they'll tell you the truth and if something needs fixed, they are very fair on pricing. I can't recommend them enough!"
7867,"The wait is to long, waited over 40 minutes at a table to be served pizza that was just ok. Would not go back."
7868,The Seth Malone band and the Mabrey brothers love this bar.This is a hot spot in Kenai.

7870,"If it has been over a year since you have been,  you should go again because they have expanded it. There are lots more for sale. They also added a place to get snacks, coffee and cocoa. It is just like Christmas in there. Lots of items to buy. Once you are done in Santas workshop you have to stop by and see the reindeer"

So i dont want this one interaction to prevent me from coming back but i don’t recommend going close to closing lol
7925,"The McDonalds on Artic is my least McDonalds I have ever been to. The Manager is very rude. The staff is nice but messes up order 3 out of 4 times. The drive thru wait is very long. And, homeless people come to your car while in line. Not safe nor helpful manager."

8012,I like the Frosty's. And the burgers ain't too bad either. Cost too much!
8013,"We love VCA. We had a very bad experience with a traveling vet here a few years ago, but Dr. Mandy is absolutely amazing! She is so down to earth. She actually cares about you and your pet, not about upcharging you. I love the way the office preps for your visit with a goodie bag and welcome sign 😍 Their policy of conferencing with you about the charges BEFORE they do anything just really puts me at ease. Plus, they were very kind about telling me my dog is overweight 😂 I know, I know... we both need more walks!"
8014,Excellent service
8015,It's a mall!!!
8016,It's your typical Wendy's fast food. Nothing more nothing less. If you need a quick bite to eat Wendy's is your place. If you from the lower 48. Wendy's will cost more.
8017,"Beautiful simple decor, cozy. Very clean facility. Staff is friendly, pleasant, knowledgeable! Definitely going back!"
8018,Summer picnic great fun

8021,Consistently pleasing
8022,good fast food
8023,Nice place. Good food
8024,"Customer Service!!!  Had three dents to get fixed and when Jason had finished, you couldn't tell they were ever there. Integrity, he told me if he could not get them out, he wouldn't charge me!"
8025,Very friendly and helpful staff!
8026,Great place for pets. From dogs to rabbits
8027,Food was delicious services was great and stake cooked on point
8028,"Awesome owner, always really nice and the macaroons are really good with new flavors all the time."
8029,"Slow service due to low staffing (probably because of covid). However, if you can wait in the long line, the food is fresh and hot with good customer service."
8030,Good turkey sandwich
8031,Friendly service. Use the McDonald's app.
8032,Great selection of kids books
8033,Awesome tacos
8034,Shopping was fast and easy . They always have amazing sales meat . I would recommend the meat sales that the always have if you like to save $$$.
8035,Excellent Food and Service!!
8036,Super good tea and food
8037,It great four kids
8038,"Severely dissatisfied. First time here and they messed up not only my order, but other peoples order. The food was bland, namely the Country Fried Steak. Was like chewing in soggy jerky. And when we go to pay, they only accept cash or check, no sign posted anywhere stating this. Conveniently there was a ATM.  Only redeeming part of the meal was the biscuit and pancakes.
Shall not return."
8039,Made me so sick
8040,They have a great collection of vinyl records and strange men reading magazines.
8041,Friendly staff
8042,First time there and it was amazing  big sloppy  but not to sloppy oh OMG cant wait to go back
8043,A pricey option for dinner but the food is delicious. Huge wine selection complements the tasty seafood choices.
8044,Best coffee and snacks
8045,"While I didn't get to eat here personally, a local resident highly recommended it, which I took as meaning it is very good... While I got the impression he was being honest, I guess there's a remote possibility it's his mom's restaurant and he just wanted me to support it. Either case, I'll be stopping here when I come back!"
8046,The young lady that did my pedi was amazing. The gentleman that checked me in and out was not so amazing. Very poor customer service. He was more concerned about texting and talking on the phone. Never said thank you; luckily I had a gift card for this visit and I won’t be back.
8047,"(Translated by Google) Pleasant atmosphere, very rich food, the sea esther that serves is a beautiful sun

Agradable ambiente, la comida muy rica ,la sea esther que atiende es un sol de linda"
8048,It's a hipster oasis in the last frontier
8049,Sale
8050,Good food.
8051,"Good pizza, great beer, just don't be in a hurry.  I have been here in Anchorage for 9 years and the Moose's tooth has never disappointed. The food is always good, plenty of good beer to choose from, but it has become so popular that you can wait for an hour or more for a table.
But it is worth the wait!!"
8052,Some of the best pizza in town and for a decent price! Their calzones are fire.
8053,"Incredible views of Hood Lake. It's fun to watch the float planes land and take off. There is an on site restaurant and bar, both of which are good and worth a visit all on their own."
8054,I love the beer here. They have a great selection of micros.
8055,Interior currently under construction and dine-in is not an option. Drive- thru is open.
8056,Buffet is back
8057,"Great service, and good food."
8058,"Great atmosphere and service, receptionists on the chiropractor side can be a bit crotchety but where the magic happens is what makes coming back worthwhile. The doctors genuinely care about your health and well being."
8059,"Easy walk, nice falls. If you're looking for something a little challenging or stunning, look elsewhere."
8060,Friendly staff
8061,Easy to find what you want with great prices.
8062,Good selection. Fun to browse
8063,Two words: luxury seats
8064,My food was cold. 😖But the lady at the window was nice.
8065,Love their breakfast menu
8066,Worked very well with a time crunch that I had. They were very professional. They did a great job and I love the late night key box that you can pick up from!
8067,"This is the best Chinese food in town and at a ""reasonable"" price. Five stars for Valdez."
8068,Wonderful food and good service but just too crowded and noisy to get 5 stars.
8069,On the basis of customer service and the overall store I would say i have had very good experiences. Prices are marginally higher than other stores that offer the same product. But they do tend to carry higher quality products than other stores in the area. Staff has always been friendly and knowledgeable. Especially the fellas at the gun counter. I really like the status board at the entrance that updates you on lake and waterway conditions. Will continue to give them my business.
8070,Great theater experine and friendly staff.
8071,Nah
8072,I have had sandwiches from here they are very tasty.
8073,I.got food poisoning. French dip & fries. Must go have been old.
8074,"Not amazing by any means, but they have good deals and their food can sometimes be pretty good depending on who's working there."
8075,Great owners and great food! Definitely best lunch spot!
8076,"I make it a point to go to Sullivan's Steakhouse when I'm in town, especially when Blaze & Eric are playing, and I'm always impressed. I had the chorizo stuffed dates last night, and wowza, they we're great!"
8077,Staff look inhappy.  They don't acknowledge you if you are w waiting for propane.  Just a gas station.
8078,"Good drinks,  fun staff and awesome Mexican steak."
8079,"Great food, we like the burgers so well we have a hard time wanting to order anything else, the fries are seasoned with something that make them irresistible. We're going to try the cheesesteaks honest.."
8080,"Loved coming here, close to work, good coffee, until I tried to substitute soy and got huge chunks in the bottom of my iced drink. I nicely mentioned it to the cashier the next time (glasses and huge holes in her ears) I didnt ask for a remake and she just told me it's normal with soy milk. Went again and tried the soy milk again but its disgusting having an iced coffee with chunks at the bottom regardless if it's normal for soy to do that, she even argued with me and told me to get my coffee elsewhere. Very poor customer service and quality if you think it's okay to serve chunky drinks. Gross."
8081,Quick in and out. Great desserts.
8082,My absolute favorite Palmer restaurant. I love their burgers and adore their pie. Can't want to come back!
8083,Such a fun place to take the family. They care about their community as well and donated to our school's silent auction! Thank you H2Oasis!!!!
8084,"I’ve relied on the excellent group of caregivers at Providence for years to take great care of me and my family. From imaging, emergency room visits, surgeries and extended stays in their state of the art NICU, there is never a time I haven’t been unbelievably grateful to have such an incredible health care center to depend on. They’ve mastered medicine but also compassion, which is sometimes not the case in healthcare facilities. I’ve never had to wait long for any service and my questions are always answered thoroughly and with smiles. Today I needed a scan and was fortunate to have Dylan taking care of me but most every staff member there has made me feel completely comfortable. On a side note, I’ve spent a lot of time in their cafeteria and gift shop, both unexpectedly impressive. The gift shop has a cadre or dedicated volunteers who work there along side the regular employees, which is always wonderful to see. In fact, there are many volunteer opportunities that Providence has created to allow the community to help those who might be in need. They also have a Subway, pharmacy and a couple of coffee shops in the building. When you are there for extended periods, having these services really makes a difference. They maintain a beautiful chapel open to the public and plenty of quiet places for visitors who need a moment to sit and reflect to find on each floor. Providence is proud of their employees, the services they offer and their presence in Alaska, and well they should be."
8085,Very interesting frozen in time period house-and what a story behind the house- loved the old fashioned items strewn  all around this house
8086,Pricey for a thrift store but we did find most of our costumes there.
8087,Great Philly cheesesteaks and fries! Kind and welcoming owner/staff and good food
8088,This is an amazing place to pay respects to our fallen troops and what better place than the beautiful alaskan wilderness? The scenery is beautiful and the information is absolutely perfect.
8089,"We had a very rainy trip and it was still incredible. The crew does their best to make the trip memorable. Having a naturalist on board was a really nice feature as well. Booking was easy, as was the boarding process. The amenities on board made the trip very comfortable and smooth. Lunch was great! (Salmon chowder for both of us.)"
8090,"Exhorbant cost
Save your money...want to say to all people coming to Ak. that get drawn here to this place....

Hidden cost, contracts are changed ,information untrue. This place was an inheritance  and now in hands of grandchildren they did what grandparents did not want...make money off people .   I knew the original owners. Too bad.

Diamond M= be fair. It cost a lot to come to Ak.   to see our state. You do not need to charge so much. Start a new reputation as a gift.

Thankyou for sharing. That is what is lacking. Be a part of a better world. Help the poor. They are thrown around. Help the wealthy. They are used. Change , help share Ak. You charge to much. By your actions you can help the children. Free. You were given, now give more freely.

Why havent you ,btw,open up something, somewhere  for the underprivileged singled ,disabled Alaskans that are homeless?   Tiny homes. Help the year around senior disabled citizens that built Alaska before you were even here. Theres a reputation to be proud of."
8091,Great place to bring the family
8092,Good combo meals
8093,It is a nice place to get your nails done
8094,Love it
8095,"I make a rule to stop here every time I pass by. The slices are generous and delicious and the service is faster than you would expect. Also, fun fact: the sign that spells out ""coasT"" is a remnant from the previous tenant, which had the same letters spelling out ""Tacos."""
8096,Great live music and delicious food. What's not to like?
8097,I love the shopping center I’ve never seen it packed! Which is great ☺️
8098,"Severely dissatisfied. First time here and they messed up not only my order, but other peoples order. The food was bland, namely the Country Fried Steak. Was like chewing in soggy jerky.

8099,Beautiful Amazing views
8100,Clean
8101,"There is a veritable bevvy of donuts to choose from this locally owned bakery.  Their prices have crept up consistently over the past 2 years and they don't always include a bakers dozen when you buy a box.  That being said, they are a quite treat for the occasional pit stop and to share with friends."
8102,Had a great early morning game. No one else on the course definitely worth going.
8103,"Pretty good service and the red bull smoothies are bomb, but you have to ask for the colors to be added which is kinda lame if you forget.  A little pricey but usually worth it and the wait time isn't to bad most of the time"
8104,Fast service
8105,Great services and prompt
8106,"What a great place. Makes you wonder if you're really in Wasilla. Buy a crafted coffee and a confection, then sit by the fireplace and warm up in an environment that is unique in the Valley."
8107,The staff is very nice and quick to help.
8108,Good price and cleanliness.
8109,"Food was ""ok"" not great.  Service was far from good.  Took a long time to get food.  Out of shrimp."
8110,"Food was good especially scallops, however the king crab did not seam to be fresh. It came out cold and soggy.
Quite speedy for the quality of food. Decent wine selection."
8111,Beautiful setting...great staff
8112,We had an excellent waitress.  The food was delicious and the bread sticks were yummy.
8113,"Friendly workers and a clean environment! I am a fan of having subway right there, could 100% recomend the chicken bacon ranch combo there!! Just only had frozen variety of meats and vegetables. Not a huge problem just heading over to safeway after for those things. Otherwise had it all for probably the cheapest on the island!"
8114,"Place was clean, and had a great selection."
8115,interesting
8116,"Frolf course, ski and bike trails, fields, walk-through archery course, beach...
Tons of fun to be had here."
8117,Wonderful
8118,"This place used to be amazing but definitely leaves some room for improvement these days. The rolls were ok, I didn't get to eat my food while it was hot as they forgot my date's food which I had to go and remind them she hadn't gotten it yet. They come back and say it just went in the frier, 10 minutes later it actually comes out...so they definitely forgot about it and then lied about it, not cool."
8119,It seems like more than half of my fry orders I've received are soggy.
8120,Great
8121,Good place to have local brews. Also has a lot food options to choose from. The staff and ambience is also nice. Good place to relax and watch sports. Prices are fairly reasonable.
8122,Outdated interior. Like 30 years outdated staff was efficient but very odd. I'm sure the manager lady was high. Food was on point and service was efficient but robotic.
8123,Best Bbq in ALASKA hands down
8124,The fur rondy is going on right now with carnival rides and food Booth with dog racing and a whole bunch of craziness with fur
8125,"The ramen was delicious! Naruto is a great place to go on a chilly day. The first time I went the service was great, and the second time it was ok. The food was flavorful. My favorites were the vegetable ramen and curry ramen. I would definitely recommend trying this with a friend."
8126,Excellent pizzas
8127,They have a couple of meal deals that are a good bargain for your buck right now.
8128,"Good food, staff is always great! Can’t beat the special margaritas"
8129,I really love McDonalds. I love the buttermilk crispy chicken tenders. I love the things on the receipts where you can buy one get one free n stuff like that. Fast food. Easy to order. Usually have nice workers. But sometimes they forget things in the order.
8130,Rose and Ciff provide outstanding service and handiwork. They're superbly skilled at locs and other hair styles.
8131,Good food and staff.  Fast service.
8132,"Very beautiful scenery, seeing quite a few eagles, harbor seals, good spot to leave from when you get a chance to go out fishing."
8133,"Baseball fields, access to the costal trail, playground up top, parking lot, port-a-pottys, and even a small garden to walk through."
8134,Drove from Fairbanks to Anchorage for a nice weekend stay prior to deployment. Rented the room for the swimming pool. Find out that they close the pool on weekends to do maintenance. 😥
8135,Excellent food!
8136,JCP
8137,"Good steak, service was mediocre."
8138,People like helping you if you have any questions
8139,"Great fun because of the people we enjoy.
But the place has a weird smell and needs to be redecorated. Mold ?"
8140,They do great and if you are going to wait for your car they make you a priority
8141,Big pumpkins and some Kool stuff
8142,Ok place prices ok my furniture cushions broke down less than a year.
8143,"There was a male employee in there who was incredibly knowledgeable about the products, very friendly, and his make up was on point. People who like what they do or are passionate about what they do are always amazing employees. He was amazing"
8144,Love this place. It's better than Starbucks!!!
8145,"I avoid getting mixed drinks here due to a weak pour and high price, but the beer is decent. I like the jack daniels sauce and the food is always good here. Lots of cute servers if that is important to you."
8146,I went in to Lowe's at this location just to see what they and and window shop employees  Was on the ball to see if I needed help
8147,"Took one if my clients here to bowl for one session. Staff was super unprofessional, will be driving to Anchorage from now on to bowl. Not worth my $4.75"
8148,The Pie place
8149,Good Walmart. Not crowded.
8150,Fun great coffee
8151,"Quiet atmosphere, good food.
Great service"
8152,"Really great service from super friendly staff. Personal faves are their Kale & Quinoa salad, and of course the Macaroons. Always try their specials, but I love their Birthday Cake! Oh and their fresh brewed tea is amazing."
8153,Great food!
8154,Good food
8155,Very nice place
8156,A cigarette store with a plethora of alcohol. Service quite good.
8157,Great customer service.
8158,Had what I was looking for
8159,"They sold me a warrantee full well knowing we we're purchasing vehicle to drive for Lyft. When I received the policy it stated that any vehicle that is used for taxi (Lyft specified) will not be covered. And, I was told they were going to get me a spare key. When I returned to pick up my matts they acted like I was nuts."
8160,"I'm pretty sure this place is a homer icon, but frozen burger patties is not ever the way to go. I'll give them one more chance for the ice cream."
8161,"Clean, well lit and a great selection."
8162,Fun for the kids. I wish they changed some of the activities out a little more often.
8163,Beautiful place beautiful people
8164,"Great selection, competitive prices...."
8165,Easy to use website to pick your services. Great customer service that calls to follow up on the plan. They evrn sent me a text when they were on their way as well. The carpets came out fantastic. This is my second time using their services and they have fulfilled all expectations and beyond.
8166,Nice place to enjoy the trail.  And enjoy the views of the trees
8167,"It was very busy today, but got my shopping done for today."
8168,"My father was visiting from out of town and we decided to take him to Seward for the day. Even during the slower seasons of Seward the Sea Life center was an enjoyable stop. My favorite attractions was the underwater viewing sections. We got to see puffins swimming under water! It was also amazing to really grasp how big the sea lions are when viewing them practically a glass panels distance from you! It also makes for some cool photos too.

I highly recommended this as a place to visit year round and for all ages. Exhibits were very kid friendly. There is a touch tank too!"
8169,"Cute place, their crepes are huge. The crepes are definitely worth the price."
8170,Good food.
8171,It's subway.
8172,Its got a great atmosphere. Love the people there.
8173,Room was good once we got one.  Tried to check in at 730 pm after driving all day.  Manager had to go room by room to find us a clean one.
8174,very good clean & serves were courteous food GREAT
8175,"Their burgers are delicious but I must say, the fries are always borderline burnt. Also, the pies are not what everyone makes it out to be. It's okay. I've had better pies. They always have great customer service though."
8176,Great haircut generally without having to wait and the hair stylists are wonderful to chat with. Then there is the receptionist who makes my heart go wild! 😍
8177,Great service and great food!
8178,Made getting my repairs done as painless and easy as possible all while keeping me informed with daily updates.
8179,"Reasonable good food, great service"
8180,Same than Wainwright
8181,Went to see an All-star game with Kelly Herndon. Enjoyed it very much
8182,Good
8183,This is one of my all time favorite places to be. Not only do they have church services but they have groups for both men and women to grow and fellowship to get closer to Jesus!!
8184,We love watching the boys play here. Its always fun for the whole family. Clean and well cared for.
8185,Great food and service. Cooked to order. They will serve breakfast during lunch or dinner.
8186,"Great 12step program, because I  needed to get serious about my recovery to stay alive"
8187,Big rooms but the heat was in full blast. It made sleeping miserable.
8188,Typical McDonald's. Always have to wait for them to make coffee! But the cheeseburgers are always ready.
8189,"The kindest, most-informed, professional vets I've had the pleasure of working with in Anchorage!"
8190,"Great! Gym, Workout Room. SHOWERS. THANKS TO COUPLE ON COUNTER FOR DAY PASS INFO & HOT SHOWER. 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE*****"
8191,It's McDonald's. Lol
8192,Great service on my winterization
8193,Always
8194,"Pricey. Smelly. The lady working wasn't friendly. Took over five minutes to reset the machine.

We paid for two games to get the third free. She then told us that's only Monday-Thursday and it was Friday. Mind you, we were the only ones there besides leagues...

Like adding an extra game would have been skin off her neck?

Next time we want to spend $25 we'll go see a movie... At least it'll least longer than 50 minutes. SMH."
8195,Great place great prices
8196,Loved being able to eat outside on the deck ♡
8197,"Just an average buffet, but very nice staff and helpful if you can't find something you are looking for"
8198,Hard to find. Fun but not an easy to follow course
8199,Great place to go for any train lover young and old
8200,Loved it!
8201,delicious food and good service.  havent been disappointed yet
8202,This is the only place I get my coffee from hands down the best and they have good food as well as beer too!
8203,Awesome place
8204,Love this Alaskan store!
8205,The only hand made crust in town. Its a little pricy but its juneau.
8206,Best place to go in town.
8207,Nice little hike!
8208,Small.
8209,Always changing. Eclectic mix of repurposed and upcycled house goods. Clothing vintage. Coffee shop. Good cause.
8210,"Fun place to visit, does a great job of explaining the natural and human environment of the Kotzebue region"
8211,Good location
8212,Pokestops by the lake
8213,Never have enough checkouts open always​ have to wait a long time
8214,"Trip to Alaska would be definitely incomplete without 26 glaciers cruise! Just awesome! Mesmerizing Nature, giant glaciers will stun you!!!"
8215,"Good food.  Pretty busy and kinda noisy, but I like it."
8216,"Long Branch is one that I am torn to rate; I don't want to share it with the wrong crowd. It is entirely understated. It's a little rough around the edges. They have plenty of beer on tap, and the food is fantastic. They serve a few things and they do them right. You can't go wrong here. It's an awesome spot to have a few drinks and a burger."
8217,Its definitely getting better with the service part of it. You still see so much waste of time while customers need help you still see many employees just standing around and talking not helping so they still need improvement
8218,"The shop itself is easy to access and very attractive inside. The large windows and different styles of seating (bar seating, group tables, couches, small tables) is very enjoyable. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the menu is straight forward and fairly priced. I loved the art on the top of my friends vanilla latte, and my mocha was to die for! It's like they used Mexican chocolate, the flavor was very unique and I enjoyed every drop. I will be back!"
8219,"Fun place to drink, eat, and watch sports. Very easy going place"
8220,Perhaps the best selection of cigars in Alaska at the usual ridiculous Alaskan tobacco prices.
8221,Needs more entertainment for children
8222,"They are interested in new customers like me and are paying attention when you come in, what more could you want? Very helpful, will visit again."
8223,Nice small and very well organized!!
8224,The best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. Even for the high price it was still really good.
8225,Hands down the best Thai food in town. I traveled extensively in Thailand and the food here was exactly the same as in Thailand. Highly recommend this place for an authentic experience.
8226,Good gf options
8227,Friendly and helpful front desk staff. The room is very comfy with a full kitchen. The room was clean as well.
8228,Kim is an excellent bartender and server.  She always makes me feel welcome by calling me by name and she is very punctual with food and drink orders.
8229,Dumb flavors and over priced. Just go to Mcdonalds.
8230,Very nice people who work there and fast service
8231,This is the best Reuben sandwich ive had in fairbanks...thank you. I will be back. An i had a taste if my friends spicy tomato soup. That was great as well. Prices are not bad and waitress was attentive. 5 stars super place to go.
8232,Good beer and good food
8233,Auctions nice
8234,"It's a Costco, so you know, no surprises. Lots of bulk items. The parking lot is always congested."
8235,These guys are top notch.
8236,"Costco always has great deals, as long as you can use the bulk amounts. The only complaint I have is that they occasionally discontinue an item and sub in a new similar item"
8237,This airline is always late. Very rarely do I have an on time flight.
8238,Best homemade chips and salsa in town!
8239,Its a nice facility but they need a better way for us to clean the cardio machines when we're done using them.
8240,"Nice exhibits, large diorama, large antler arch outside. HUGE sunflowers out front (summertime)."
8241,Easiest vehicle purchase ever. ZERO pressure. I asked for their best price and the competition wasn't even close. Go see Rick Phillips for your next new vehicle purchase.
8242,Great selection
8243,Excellent
8244,They sell other things besides gas. Go inside and the same bubbly worker who is always there is there. Great service and awesome when I needed to price check multiple candy bars to get the best value.
8245,Pretty good
8246,"I love the prices, deals, and everything.. the staff is wonderful.  They are 1 of the best shops in Anchorage"

8249,Dirty tables. Place never feels clean for customers. Can only imagine the kitchen.
8250,"They make some fine beer, and good whiskey selection. Food is pretty yummy as well."
8251,Be careful which pet you buy .... Remember you'll have to buy food for this animal for life. How much does a snake eat in mice? Do you really want a bunch of mice at home or go weekly & WAIT for one to be boxed up for you.
8252,Hot and delicious. Good menu variety and good service even when it was crowded (which is only because there was a convention in town.)
8253,"Pros - fast service, generous portions, large menu, not very busy on a Sunday afternoon, easy to get in and out of.

Cons - on the pricey side for Asian food."
8254,Better tacos than I ever would have expected in Soldatna!
8255,Can't get a table for two on the patio.

8263,"Possibly better than frozen, but the wait may not be worth it.
My first Papa John Pizza experience. The pizza sauce is too far on the sweet side for me. It was very average - which was disappointing because they claim ""better Pizza"". The taste isn't better .

Much prefer Domino's or Sicily's for delivery
Nothing beats Costco Pizza for me though :)"
8264,"FYI. This chain was once ALL Little Caesar's pizza franchise locations. The owner ended the LC franchise agreement and re branded to The Great Alaska Pizza Company. The pizza here is comparable to Little Ceasars. However, the deep dish (Detroit sicilian style) is excellent, and is better than LC.

The owner at this location gives back constantly to the community and cares about his customers.

This is by far the best value for pizza in all of AK!"
8265,"I never shopped there before, but we were in the neighborhood and I really liked it. Not too many people like the other stores. 🤗"

8274,Super fun for famlies.  My kids thought it was great! Its funny and impressive

8276,"Reasonable price, nails look great. I got a gel coat. Three stars becuase they were very rough with my cuticles; they were sore and red in places after the visit had to ask them to wash old skin out of some cuticle clippers a few times. They said they cleaned all their tools in the morning so theyre good... No, clean your tools after every customer please. And these were minor things, but he lady who did my nails didn't speak very well English, and there was polish everywhere."
8277,Good food decent prices good atmosphere

8282,"It is a quiet place in the winter, my dog and I walked the docks, and the public bathrooms and dock office was open while I was there during the daylight hours. There is a concrete boat ramp, and floating well maintained docks. The back drop of the bay is also pleasing to the eyes. Attendant in the convenience dock shop was also kind."
8283,"Good food, good drinks,  good god, let's eat here any time"
8284,"They have a great program, helping feed the community."

Granted they were a person short but the did not inform us of that until we were leaving. Overall the sushi was good but you need to order more then sushi to get a full meal."
8291,"A thin crust pizza with any topping I wanted out of there bunch for under $10. Works for me. Place was clean, staff was friendly and the food was quite tasty. Looking forward to going back again soon."

8299,4 star food with 5 star service
8300,Good quality wash.
8301,"Easy to get to. The trail is not strenuous. Depending on which loops you take, you can take a short walk or hike for hours. The trails and turns are all very well marked. A great place to hike, take the dogs, mountain bike. I imagine in the winter it will be awesome for snowshoeing and cross country skiing as well."
8302,"We had our department holiday get together there. The catered food was simple, and delicious."
8303,Beautiful
8304,"Great store with lots of options for backpacking, camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities. They have lots of clothing options and some pretty good sales. My favorite part about REI is the hammock section - I love dreaming about all the accessories they've got - and the vast amount of freeze dried camping/ backpacking meals. It's also just a fun place to look around at. You never know what goodies you'll find."
8305,Skilled.  Attentive. Professional. Warm. Caring. Focused on the patient needs.
8306,Good friendly people. Very good meat section
8307,Great winter or bad weather day spot!!!
8308,The facility was decent my only complains are that they attach TVs to all the cardio equipment so you are forced to watch something or at least a screen in front of you and be no area for core
8309,"Pleasant, professional, kind and caring."
8310,Stopped bye for a torch tip. Was told Oops I didn't realize they were sold out. Really❗poor quality order personal
8311,I've been going here for about four years to get my nails done and to receive pedicures. I'd like that I always receive the same quality of service from everyone as I do from my main ghoul. I receive compliments everywhere on my nails. I highly recommend this place to anyone.

8314,Delicious!!! The taco special was bomb. The beer battered halibut was so good. I cannot wait to go back. Finished with wild scoops for dessert 😍
8315,"I dig the margaritas and it's always nice to have a draft Modelo with lime. The food is very run of the mill, though. Standard Alaskan Mexican food, which is to say bland and lackluster. It's a nice place; i wish the food was better."

8317,Nice shopping center.
8318,It's a Walmart

8323,Amazing food
8324,"Deliciousness!  Went here for brunch and our waiter, Ty, was super friendly with suggestions.  Great atmosphere and excellent food!  Don't skip dessert!"
8325,The teriyaki chicken is probably the tastiest choice on the menu. Some of the food can be dried out and the noodles aren't very tasty... but it's fried Chinese food so how much is really expected?
8326,This place doesn't grant the online menu and the quality of the food they put out is not very satisfactory as it should be especially comming from a corporation
8327,Best selection of gear in Fairbanks.  Place to go to get climbing stuff.
8328,Kind of friendly and somewhat knowledgeable when it comes to your pet and it's needs.

8340,"Excellent mechanics, they really worked with me to get my truck running as fast as possible and at a fair price. I'll definitely be back if I have any more car trouble in the area."

8350,Rude employees will ruin an otherwise good business everytime
8351,"Did a decent job on beard expectations, clean job. Returned for a trim, not open Sundays?Hours need updated if so."
8352,Awesome food best food in big lake.  Very convenient   next to NAPA in stost mall.  This was the pastrami on rye and it's delicious.  I have had other food and it's all good.  Awesome French fries and food is cookedc not sittings in greaseg.  Recommend to anyone around wanting a great lunch.
8353,Great food. Long time local business. Service is hit or miss which is who it's only 4 starts.
8354,"One of my family's favorites! Great stop to stretch the legs, check out the water and have a good look both ways along the inlet. Make sure it's clear when you pull back on the highway and get up to speed quickly as its on a busy bend."
8355,True Alaskan dive bar
8356,"Don't go very often, but this theater sits in the Dimond Center Mall. More places to spend money after the show."

8358,Beautiful place to catch scenery
8359,Everything you need
8360,"Rodney tries (mostly successfully and always well mannerdly) to keep it under control or else it would be a clown show. Still the best bar in keetnis. Get a room there in the winter, pass out by the river while it's warm."
8361,Another Walmart.  We all know what to expect.
8362,Not so clean. Really kinda shabby compared to the more modern one in Palmer.
8363,"This used to be one of my favorite places in Wasilla, until today. What a huge disappointment! Mushy noodles, black over cooked meat, the egg drop soup was like cough syrup for christ sake. Thanks for F'ing up my lunch experience Kings Asian, way to go!"
8364,"Bland ""teriyaki"" and rubbery chicken. Mostly store bought veggies and the mini carrots had been frozen and re-used and so bad I spit them out.  The pork fried rice is not fried, but just like it came out of the rice cooker with some sauce mixed in.  Veggies are out of the mix I buy at the store. NOT fresh, frozen. Egg roll exactly like the ones I can get at the gas station. Weird. I could make it better at home. SOO disappointed. Will not go back.  Sorry."
8365,"Lance is a great barber, gives good haircuts. Walk in or Appointment..."
8366,We enjoyed our trip there
8367,"Great staff, drinks, and food. Only downside is trying to find a place to sit!"
8368,"(Translated by Google) Why the music in the cable car. ..? It doesn't bring anything to the experience, we no longer hear comments ... I go to the mountains and not to a rapping concert. All that to say that I found this very unpleasant and inappropriate.

(Original)
Pourquoi la musique dans le téléphérique. .. ? Ça n'apporte rien a l'expérience , on n'entend plus les commentaires... Je vais en montagne et non à un concert de rapp. Tout ca pour dire que j'ai trouvé cela très désagréable et inapproprié."

8384,Where to start.... bagles are so yummy!
8385,"Tasty food,  fast service"
8386,Such a pleasure when a restaurant puts the effort into a veggie entree. Had the cedar plank tofu with pasta and it was very good. Dessert put me in orbit with the 4-layer chocolate cake with raspberry mousse.
8387,"Dawn, the store manager, was amazing and knowledgeable. Great experience buying wine and returning a keg!"
8388,Had the product in stock but refused to retrieve the product forced me to take a refund after burning 30 minutes of my time.  Got what I needed from the home depot.

A Black Card member area with massage chairs, vitality machines, water massage beds and tanning machines (lay down models).  Gym is fairly large and cleanup stations are conveniently located in several areas.  Lots of free weights and specialty areas as well.  Staff is laid back and attentive to your needs.  Great place for the average person to work out!"
8394,Good Italian food and very friendly staff. Good atmosphere!
8395,Best Asian market in Anchorage
8396,Excellent service and food! Would definitely eat there everytime I come to Talkeetna. The blueberry cheesecake is BOMB. Steak dinner is amazing and the Thia Coconut Curry is crazy good! 10/10 would recommend

8403,"Good and cheap college depending on what you're majoring in, but the one thing it lacks is a unified campus feeling. Everything is spread out and there isn't much college spirit."
8404,My Dad never suggests a place to eat when asked. But this morning when we talked he said THE DINER with no hesitation. Great staff. Caribou sausage is good. Breakfast is a little pricey. Check it out.
8405,I love their Indian curry!🥰💚 the people who work there are super nice! Funny! Good good food!
8406,Fast friendly service
8407,"Stopped in for a rental and they provided fast, friendly and very helpful service."

8423,Went in for two recalls and oil change... when I got my car back I had screws left  on the floor and cup hold... really not happy at all.. then I had to turn my car to correct the issue on my birthday hours b4 I had to  go to the work.. what way to start a day and my birthday... they sure made it memorable
8424,"It is pretty good, I will definitely return."
8425,So far I have loved everything I have tried.  New favorite was the Crab dip

8427,Love their hot chocolate. A great little place to meet up with friends.
8428,I love this mall!
8429,"Top shelf service. They will always find a way to get you on the road, or find someone who can."
8430,My first time trying chicken and waffles so I might be biased but man this place was good. Just the chicken is pretty good.
8431,"Little to no customer service: (girlfriend is writing this) I was put down to be called when each new 5e DnD book came out, but only receieved one call out of 5 books. I brought this problem up after my boyfriend let me know that all his friends got books. I called and let them know that the call list was not being used as I did not receive a call and then said they fixed it. Four books later still no calls from them. they also did not ask me if wanted debit or credit. just a small annoyance. they are very unorganized and are socially inept to a degree of which it can harm their service and business.

Update, I'm now getting calls well after the fact and have no idea why the list is being used months later."
8432,"Good salads and personal size pizza. Great service. Our 4 and 2 year olds said the pizza was ""yummy.""  We will be going back for sure!"

8434,Great sweets!
8435,Food was amazing but the person on the phone was very rude.
8436,"Wonderful, caring people who take good care of you."
8437,"Staff are friendly, though they are always out of items on their menu. Whether it be breakfast or dinner. Everytime I come here I always have to pick another item because the item I initially wanted they don't have. What's the point if putting it on the menu if they're going to be out of it... frustrating!"
8438,Great store
8439,Great Mexican food
8440,Fresh food. 24 hours!!
8441,"Wonderful atmosphere, great place to get a high class drink."
8442,Hands down the best fries in town!!
8443,The Eagle River McDonald's has very good service. The boy's are 'lovin' it!'
8444,"Texas Roadhouse is one of the first choices for us when we go out with the family. It has options for a variety of appetites and I can not think of a place that has better customer service.  It has, by far, the best, most friendly and genuine staff. I have the same great experience everytime at either Anchorage location. I can not say the same for a location I tried while traveling out of state. Although I do have a usual dish, all of their meals are good and would recommend any of them."
8445,It was good but had to wait for about 1 and half hrs to be seen.. best to create an appointment to be seen on their website
8446,"Food was good but table sticky, and slow service."
8447,The foid is delicious and the service is great! I will definitely be back! ♡

8451,Best breakfast in Alaska by far!!!
8452,Never enough checkers  !!!
8453,The only reason my son and I walked near this park was because we had to cross it to get were we where going. Almost every time we have gone there I either had to walk my sad mid home because there was a person sleeping on the equipment or I had found needles on the park grounds. I feel this park is dangerous and wont take my son there again.
8454,Get here early the donuts go fast! Great selection and are delicious.
8455,Beautiful place
8456,One of my favorite stores
8457,"Lunchtime disappointment

Typically we have made it here around dinner time, the food is full of flavor and well made.

Today we did a pickup order and it was bland and had corn in the fried rice and egg drop soup? A real shame to spend that kind of money on poorly seasoned/prepped food."
8458,"Love the ""do it yourself"" gyros style sandwiches! Great niche!"
8459,Bomb! It was yummy delicious.
8460,Great employees... always kind and willing to help....very good product availability....
8461,"Great local spot with a buzzing atmosphere, some of the best food in town and live music some nights."
8462,Been going to this restaurant over the years with family and friends. big unique tasty burgers  geared towards Alaskan type  flavors. The only - is they still don't accept debit and credit cards so cash only at this place
8463,Great location
8464,2 for $8
8465,Confusing store arrangement & helpless sales associates.
8466,"Loading area if you take the trip to Denali natural park. A must do if you visit Alaska. Saw bears, elks, birds, etc."
8467,Cool place to visit but worth it for the Ambiance
8468,Best sporting and outdoors store in the valley!
8469,Try the lamb. Do it.
8470,Always enjoy going in there.
8471,"Normally my experience is great, but now I have a event I'm trying to plan on. So I'm trying to plan a order ahead. I called your line to ask how to do it was given this 888 number that is not even taking phone calls. I called them back and was put on hold. Figured out how to do it online and I wish I could show you a picture, but the plan ahead order clearly states anywhere from 1-21 days however blocks out the days after the 4th. Seriously considering taking my $140 order somewhere else because I am being refused help as well as the online service clearly is not working. Please reach out to me."
8472,Beautiful!
8473,Fast and friendly service the food is great
8474,Nice place to relax
8475,Didn't have my favorite candy
8476,Been going here for awhile. Will always be better than panda Express in my opinion. They have the best staff and best wait time!! Quick and very very delicious:).
8477,"The park was under construction at the time we visited. Additionally, it was hard to find."
8478,"In my opinion the Inn At Whittier is one of the most comfortable and beautiful hotels in Alaska.  You'll notice the beautiful woodwork in the lobby area; you'll notice the beautiful Pacific Ocean just beyond the windows; and you'll notice the Inn At Whittier is a little small.  I think the size of the hotel is just right for me, cozy.  Enjoy the walks, boat watching, and the delicious drinks at the bar downstairs."
8479,"Great place to take your family!! Great place to learn about sea life! You should definitely go there and support their efforts to educate the public, and care for the marine life. 😊😊"
8480,"Met a friend for breakfast and had the buffet. It was very good and our server filled to-go cups with coffee for us, and unexpected and welcome thoughtfulness."
8481,Great place
8482,This used to be and old mechanic garage Hartley motors I love what they did with the place .. Super adorable A lot of neat stuff a lot of weathered stuff and designed to look vintage ♡♡ Definitely worth a walk around super cute try the kombucha on the other side♡♡
8483,Another FABULOUS PRINCESS AK LODGE!
8484,"Beautiful interior, it also has a pond you can look at in the back. There's a deck in the back with a few tables. Amazing food, I loved the fried zucchini, and very nice customer service. Has a pool table and dart game. Two musicians also showed up and my group and I enjoyed and had fun with them."
8485,"Put good in get good out,😁🎃"
8486,"Safe practices by employees all wearing masks. Clean restaurant, healthy food decent price."
8487,Great food good music
8488,"It's now called Satly's and it's honestly horrible. Went there with a group of friends to have Italian style food and was super disappointed when I was handed a new menu with over priced snack like items. Mainly sandwiches and salads. Paid for the drinks and the appetizer that we ate (the waitress tried to charge us for the other one that didn't even come out yet) They should really have signs up saying that it's changing and the wait staff should address it as soon as they seat people.
It sucks that they sold the place, Geraldo's is only a few miles away and we'll be going there from now on."
8489,Excellent food and Superior service. Everything you could want waited on opening day an hour to eat it so so worth it!!!  My dog even got a Corn dog!
8490,"Great food and service!

The add-ons are a little pricey though, not in the custom of the original Asian hot pot restaurants so not a full five star review."
8491,Messes up order
8492,Well maintained pool that is clean.
8493,Delicious food! The tacos are my fav.
8494,"Went to change plans, but all I really needed was to up my preset megabits in my phone systems.
Thanks to the employee that helped me."
8495,Multiple bays for washing and vacuuming your car.
8496,It's a NO kill shelter dedicated to rehoming animals. With animals turned in they'll do all they can to follow your wishes while rehoming them.
8497,"The sweet n sour sauce wasn't up to standards, very bland :("
8498,"Was ok, our kids food came out 10 mins after ours,my roast beef looked like it had been cooked 5 times,pretty much a hard shredded mass."
8499,"A grand bar exemplifying Alaska in all ways. Rustic, old school, and good feel bar. Music and dancing on the weekend. Chill and relax midweek."
8500,Great price on B&W turn over hitches
8501,Best shopping
8502,This store and its employees rock.. rock stars
8503,"Bento boxes are good proportions and delicious AYCE Sushi, my usual orders:

Rock & Roll, TNT, any of the baked rolls, Gyoza, J Special #2.

You'll be leaving full. Start with 2 rolls then drop to just 1 at a time so you can finish it.

No dessert with the AYCE menu and they do not offer half rolls."
8504,"Service was great, friendly staff, comfortable environment, fair prices."
8505,"My new favorite in dining and entertainment. Amazing food, beverage, service and atmosphere. Cant wait to experience brunch someday!😋"

8509,"These folks are always super nice, thorough, quick and really friendly. Somehow, this place is a well kept secret!"
8510,Gate Restaurant ..
8511,The food was good but the price is bad
8512,Great restaurant! If you need a Viet fix and you don't want to drive far away to get it. This is the best place. It might be the top pho in anchorage but it's definitely consistently good. The restaurant has convenient parking as well as a clean restaurant. The only reason I dinged it a star was because it's not as good(portion wise) as some of the other top Viet places which are a little farther away
8513,Best chinese restaurant ever
8514,Good place for breakfast except for the steak omelet that was 90% onion and about 10 very small pieces of steak
8515,"Great staff, Bacon jam burger is great, loaded tots!"
8516,Patty melt was good but no big deal. Found out later that I should have had the halibut sandwich.
8517,Lots of TVs if you're into sports.  Great views and awesome outside seating in the summer time.  Decent bar food.  Good overall.  The bartender's can be slow but they make good drinks.
8518,A dump
8519,My Bank First Naional Bank
8520,Got my COVID vaccine today :)
8521,Nice 😌
8522,menu was incorrect on the sign and my order was wrong. I was the only person at Mc Donald's at the time.
8523,Really good food and enough 4 dinner
8524,"Not THE worst mocha I've had, but pretty close."
8525,Great food
8526,Good food at a good price. Sushi is not the best in the area but acceptable. A good place to eat.
8527,"Its an incredible place to see wild animals up close. My favorite is the bears, i did the close encounter with the bears for $85 where they took us around back where we got to feed the bears. They show you a few tricks and then let you take photos. The whole experience with the bear encounter was about 30 minutes long. The whole park itself isnt that big but definitely worth the stop to see nature up close. They also have a great snack shack."
8528,Great atmosphere
8529,"Good coffee, friendly staff, dog treats for your canine. They can be plagued by long lines. They retain their staff for so long that I makes me hopeful that the owner compensates the employees fairly and treats them well."
8530,Great food great service!
8531,"Good food , super busy. Sliders were bomb"
8532,Really great selection since they opened up this bigger one. Brings a lot more options and variety that helps reduce the need to drive out elsewhere like Wasilla etc. Great local selections as well for tourists.
8533,I love Slow Burn. The staff are outstanding. I'm glad they have a new store.
8534,Love this place!
8535,These guys are very awesome they do great work you should come down and visit

8539,They're very chincey on you sub toppings
8540,Typical Chili's food.
8541,"Mostly I went here because it was very cheap, and I was visiting friends in Talkeetna.  The room was small, warm, and very clean.  Not ""clean for this price range"" but very clean by any standard, I was impressed.  There were no smells, not cleaning supplies, not staleness, not human or smoke.  No smells at all.  I used to be a housekeeper, and I can tell a lot of effort went into cleaning, both now and in the past.

The room was quiet as well, it is very much separate from the bar.  The room was cheap, among the cheapest in town.  If you are looking for a small, cheap room, with a warm shower, this place would work great."
8542,"Long wait time on the food, but the server was attentive and kept us updated. Food was delicious once it arrived."
8543,Surprisingly good burgers made to order.
8544,Not quite sure was told that they could not service me because they did not have enough coverage in my area. Sorry we have all the customers that we can service in that area
8545,"Beautiful facility, Clean, perfect spot for serious athletes"
8546,Good was great.  Service was great.  Totally recommend

8551,Great venue for large entertainment
8552,I love thg he Aspen chain.
8553,First time trying halibut tacos. Yummy
8554,"Awesome food and location, right on the airport."
8555,"9-2-16, very nice rustic place. One gas and one diesel pump."
8556,The automated system takes some getting used to.
8557,Anchorage trip from the valley
8558,Good fries.  It looked like they used frozen burger patties. Just okay for the price.
8559,Different varieties
8560,My family loves this restaurant. The bulgogi combo and yakisoba are my favorites. The seafood and tofu stew is also incredible if you're into mixed seafood like octopus and soft shell crab
8561,Great coffee
8562,"The path which definitely will lead you walking into the nowhere that you come from!
The atmosphere that definitely will bring you into a world created by yourself!"
8563,"Relaxing atmosphere, great service and excellent food. Amazing pizzas!!!"
8564,"Great store front for a great brand. Helping staff too, but don’t expect to meet anyone that uses the products"
8565,The food was delicious!
8566,"Excellent selection of beer, wine and other hard to find products. Decent prices and helpful staff get you in and out quickly."
8567,Horrible
8568,The closest thing Homer has to a music venue (hosting Beausoleil when we were in town) also has respectable bar food
8569,"Great place, great soup!"
8570,Awesome! Almost wore out my camera taking pictures of the Trumpeter Swans!
8571,Always great
8572,Game stop is always amazing but I love the people that work in this one specifically. Very informative and helpful!
8573,Good eats
8574,"Had a church party with a nice lawn. room enough to set up a volleyball net, bubble table, play dough table and room for throwing Frisbee. The gazebo picnic area gave us plenty of room to eat and stay out of the rain when it rained occasionally."
8575,"Awesome shop for kids of all ages! Everything from gaming gear to nanos, jigsaw puzzles, princess play gear and STEM sets!"
8576,It's a fun place to ski or snowboard. The staff there are polite. Depends on the weather. You'll either have the time of the day. Or you'll have a slow day on the hill. Only depends on the weather.
8577,"Great place. Impressive beer. The prices are a little high, though."
8578,I really like Once Upon a Child.  The sporting goods store next door is great as well!
8579,New menu not as good as it used to be. Bring back the carmel pecan pancakes!
8580,Almost everything in the store is cheap
8581,Such a great environment! Friendly people and great products!
8582,This place has some of my favorite foods and the servers there are so nice and one of my best friends parents work there.

8584,Good food. Military Disc
8585,"We ordered no red sauce white sauce we ask for stuffed crust and no stuffed crust but she said ok I make
We ask plz no red sauce. Plz
The dough was still raw in the middle
And it cost 50.00 if you want grate pizza go to the Stamp Mill in Valdez.  YUMMMMM"
8586,Helpful and knowledgeable staff!! They are happy to take the time to fully answer questions. They got my special order books quickly!
8587,"Authentic Chicago dogs in Alaska!  Tastes just like you're in chicago.  If you haven't ever tried a real Chicago dog you gotta get one.

They have burgers, brats, pizza, and Italian beef sandwiches too,  but the dogs are what make it for me."
8588,"It was a 2 1/2 star hotel. I reserved a king bed and got an older room with 2 Queen beds.  When I asked fir another room with a King bed I was offered a refurbished King suite for TWICE THE PRICE!!
Unfortunately, there was No Way I was going to stay in the other room with 2 Queens, so they knew they had me!"
8589,Pretty spendy so may wait on next trip. Good food tho
8590,This location has the best staff. Very helpful and fast. Great Pizza
8591,Rentacar winter tires have to ask for em
8592,We took the cable car to the top to take photographs. The panoramic view was spectacular.

8597,Great taste of fishes
8598,"I've visited this place twice in a week. Both times I ordered the same dish: spicy veggie mac and cheese with a side salad. First time I visited, the mac and cheese was outstanding! The cast iron skillet it came in was full to the brim, the breadcrumb topping was perfectly browned, and it was cheesy and flavorful! I was so happy with the dish that I wanted to go back, and I did!  I really wished I had taken pics of both dishes, because it was like night and day! When I placed my order the second time, the the skillet was far from full and the breadcrumb topping barely covered half the dish. Maybe the difference was the first time I went, it was a weekday and the restaurant wasnt that busy, and the second time I went was a weekend, and crazy busy. But consistency is key, so I'm hoping when I go back, I would get the cook that was there during the weekday vs the weekend cook!

The wait staff was amazing and extremely helpful and I do plan on returning. I just was disappointed with my dish because it was so delicious and plentiful the first time. I'm hoping my second visit was a one time occurrence!"
8599,Great store and employees! Easy handicap parking and access inside and out. Help with most anything without much of a wait. Great supplies for our awesome furry family members.
8600,They have a sweet little playground and lawn area. My 3 year old loves to watch the planes and play here.
8601,"A little expensive, but great job."
8602,Great place to visit while in Alaska. There are outdoor exhibits with different Alaska wildlife animals. You can drive through and step down at each exhibit to see the animals up close and learn more about the Alaska wildlife.
8603,Great prices . Convenient
8604,"Great museum, beautiful animal mounts and artifacts, definitely see this exhibit, admission price - donation"
8605,Employees not worth minimum wage. Food is thrown together  sour cream clumped In on place hard shell tacos always broken
8606,Great customer service and a clean little room and a decent standard breakfast. The only issue was the heater is very loud thus we were awoken too many times. I will definitely stay there again but ask for a room with a newer heater.
8607,I love the fact that this place is open 24/7. Because of this it is rarely too crowded and machines are very available. On weekdays staff is here and they are very nice.
8608,Good food
8609,Excellent service and great food
8610,Something is definitely wrong with them the prime rib wasn't what it was a year ago and the wait was definitely longer than usual
8611,Fantastic experience. Steak was perfect.
8612,Really nice and quaint place. I ordered a turkey sandwich which was delicious. Everything was clean and orderly.
8613,I was very happy with the way Dawn was today. She was very pleasant and professional. Got me in and out and always smiling and happy.
8614,"This place rules! First off, late night eats until 5am, perfect for hungry service industry folks. Ruben egg rolls, pork belly tacos, breakfast burritos, steaks, sandwiches, salads, milk shakes... The variety is great and the quality is high! $10/avg menu item price. Cool aesthetic inside, too."
8615,Good friendly service
8616,"Carr's is not as good on their prices as Walmart or Fred Myers; but I refuse to shop at Walmart! So that leaves me with Carr's or Meyer's to do grocery shopping. We shop at Carr's more so than Fred Meyers, as I've been to a few Fred Meyers in town and have watched rats play playing in the isles. Every time I see this, I've gotten the manager and show them the rats playing and was told we know about it and that was that, so I quit shopping at Fred Meyers, especially the one off of Northern Lights and shop at Carr's"
8617,"When you can't get into the state DMV this is the only other choice, but the staff was kind and helpful. Under this oppression of face masks and ""distancing"" the staff was respectful and patient"
8618,It has most of what I need. However I am still looking for WB cut
8619,Shopping was fast and easy . They always have amazing sales meat . I would recommend the meat sales that the always have if you like to save $$$.
8620,Great cuts!
8621,The yarn offered here are so beautiful and soft. Needles are high quality and if you need help you can talk with any of the staff and they can help you from a question about a piece you are working now or a piece you want to work on in the future.
8622,Such a beautiful park!!
8623,"We went on the solstice and it was super crowded, but it didn't feel crowded. There was plenty of parking and everyone is super nice. This is a steep hike! But it is breathtaking."
8624,Excellent service outstanding food and great portion size for price
8625,"Great point to see the city at anytime, night day or snow.
Also great place to see the Aurora."
8626,Great place to have some bbq and a beer

8628,Program needs work
8629,Luv them/all family 2 me
8630,"Good to great all around... With the hardest to decipher bill ever. LOL. And, we did just that with our great waitress. Don't let that throw you. It's all good, but don't expect to understand a bill with doubles and top shelf upgrades and such. It's new math writ large. Grin."
8631,Typical fast food. Tasty.. Tacos. No complaints about customer service.
8632,"Exceptional  pizza and open late .way to go guys feed the party crowd
We all gotta eat right lol."
8633,If they don't have it they'll make it anyway for you
8634,Always a great place to unwind and entertain!
8635,My sisters hair is SOO SOFT
8636,Home of the $96 dollar oil changes! Pretty shady of you guys to take down your prices that you used to have posted on the wall. This is exactly why businesses go under. Wasilla is a small town so it won't take long for folks to notice the change. I had my cars serviced here for 2.5 years since I moved up here with outstanding service and price. Today I took in my van in for an oil change. Not only did I  have to wait for 4 hours to get it done (mind you it wasn't as busy as it normally is either) you guys decide to charge me $40 extra for the same oil change I have been getting for 2.5 years. Guess this was the first and last time you guys get to do that and that's how you loose customers. Guess the dealership it is from now on.
8637,Great food!
8638,Dorothy was very knowledgeable and hospitable. The church and gift shop were lovely.
8639,Good breakfasts at this cafe!
8640,"Typical Mexican restaurant decor, highbacked booths encourage a sense of intimacy.  The waiter is fast and the food very good though not particularly authentic, more like Alaska than Mexico."
8641,Good place for taking photos...
8642,Great use of masks - the always delicious Salted Carmel Cheesecake stole the show after a ricebowl with salmon.
8643,Dog friendly.
8644,Great music venue
8645,Great place to bring your children. Lots to do and learn!
8646,The steaks are to die for! They have such good service and food. The best place in Girdwood for a fancy meal.
8647,Great people
8648,Very nice staff. Clean rooms. Nice atmosphere.
8649,delicious food
8650,Los of animals you can see up close!
8651,Had to wait but it was so worth it.
8652,Always fun
8653,They do a good job on my oil change and its a reasonable price.
8654,"This is Old Chicago's ugly little brother. Food is solid, service is good, nothing about this restaurant is unique or particularly high quality, but if you are looking for a cold beer, a decent pizza and other american food, you can do much worse. They have their own signature beer supposedly brewed by glacier(IIRC), its a red ale, its pretty solid. Pretzel is pretty good as well.

The main attraction of this place is its proximity to other options and the muldoon and military communities. It's good when you are sick of other options."
8655,Great drive-thru for coffee.
8656,"Excellent in all arenas: atmosphere,  food,  drinks, service..."
8657,Small but friendly
8658,Two words: THE PIE! Holy moly! Best pie I've ever had.
8659,They do an Amazing Job and they are such Wonderful people!
8660,Really cool park with some neat little businesses and loads of historical information.  Anyone who visits fairbanks should definitely stop here.
8661,"A very authentic Chinese food place, with fast service."
8662,Food was super delicious!
8663,"The small BBQ restaurant on site was worth staying here. Get the chocolate-bourbon pecan pie for dessert.

The camp is close to a busy road so you can hear traffic. $45 for water and electric. On site waste dump and washer/dryer. Staff was friendly."
8664,This car shop is awesome. They do great work & the guys are extremely nice.
8665,What a quaint tiny town.
8666,"The Raven Hall is one of the larger buildings at The Alaska State Fairgrounds.  You'll find restrooms inside and plenty of exits.  The Raven Hall was used as the main building for the Alaska Chicks Vintage Home Market (May 12, 2018)."
8667,"Very comfortable, the service was fast, and the food was cooked very well!"
8668,Always a greeting when you walk in. Good friendly staff.
8669,"Simply amazing. I LOVE the attention and time they take with each item they prepare for you. Nothing here is boring. The menu is to die for, even if you’re not the adventurous type, you will be so happy you tried something new! I haven’t been disappointed with one little thing here. The atmosphere is cozy yet happy. You feel
Like they’ve known you forever when you walk thru the door. It’s worth every penny you spend and a date would be impressed with the experience - as it isn’t “just a meal”. Good wine to top it off. I’m getting  hungry thinking about it! Yum!"
8670,Very nice sorry hole with an impressive waterfall!!!
8671,By far the best taste of what Homer has to offer. This is definitely a local favorite.
8672,"Omg the drive thru lane was long which was understandable since I went there on a Friday like around 9 pm... the person taking my order spunded like he was kind of annoyed because I was taking too long to pick, and when I did, he just told me to go next window. When I got my food, it was hot, fresh and the condiments like sauces and straws i requested  was actually in the bag. The one that handed me my order was actually nice and wish me a good night."
8673,"We had been here before on the bar side.
This time we went to the restaurant side. It was evening and they had a special of Prime rib for two for $49.95.
Was supposed to be 12oz cuts.
We ordered them medium.
Came with asparagus, soup or salad and a side.
I got the soup which was absolutely delicious.
My husband had salad. While we were happy to know the greens were washed, they weren't drained properly so there was a pool of water and dressing at the bottom.
The asparagus was fresh but overcooked, droopy and waterlogged.
Now for the prime rib. It was well done, not even close to medium. There was no pink to be seen. We picked through it trying to find a pink piece. I've never had prime rib with the texture of ham steak, then again, I've never had prime rib cooked beyond medium.
The server didn't come back until with the check.
I told her the mashed potatoes and soup were great. Then showed her the prime rib and told her about the asparagus and salad, quietly of course.
She said that's what usually happens with that small of a cut and I told her last time we ordered the same and it was perfect.
Then she said they were short staffed which is ridiculous because it's peak tourist/fishing season.
She said she was our cashier also in a bid for sympathy. Didn't adjust the check so we cut up the meat for our dog and he ate it. (Which at least tells me they didn't microwave it)
I paid the check, left the normal 20% tip.
She was very nice aboit it and pleasant at first.
In summary: First time was awesome, second was a waste of money.
They are a pretty popular spot with locals so go and be the judge yourself."
8674,"Super awesome pizza, amazing cheese, terrific sauce, fantastic friendly staff! Some wings were delicious and the bread stick were the best I've had in a VERY long time, my wife love the beer cheese too. We will be back again:) bathroom and decor was fun as well."
8675,Sucked
8676,Store was clean and staff was nice pleasant place to be
8677,"The owner was so great, and very helpful!🙂"
8678,Good food and great service
8679,Amazing.  Alice the owner is a beautiful woman and she was so inviting and caring about our concerns. Tending to our needs answering our questions as well as engaging in conversation while doing a great job on my daughter's hair.  I will be going there again and recommend her salon to those who are in search of a place to relax while being pampered.
8680,GREAT PLACE
8681,Great small sushi restaurant/bar. Food was very fresh and the Florida Keys roll was awesome!! Reasonable prices for sushi in Alaska.
8682,"Quick food, you know what you're going to expect from a chain restaurant."
8683,Amazing boardwalk and facilities.  The amount of birds we were able to see and photographs in less than hour was outstanding.
8684,"Nice clean supermarket, with a big gas station next to it. If you need anything please pay them a visit"
8685,Pretty empty an ominious... Some local stands that are cool though.
8686,Food is still good.
8687,"Had an Issue with my billing, they took care of it right away."
8688,Excellent
8689,very convenient stay. staffs are very friendly.
8690,"Tasty burgers, ice cream...amazing"
8691,"A quick bite, through the drive-thru..."
8692,Great coffee and soft serve ice cream with lots of outdoor seating.
8693,"Good coffee, just gets crowded real quick"
8694,Salt of the Earth... rad place
8695,Decent seafood
8696,"Busy bar serving cruise ships. Talks beer but focuses more on pushing food to tourists off ships. Bar staff frantic, made me quite uncomfortable. Felt better out than in. Either hopelessly understaffed or incredibly inefficient, we were pleased to leave"
8697,Cheap food an it taste like cheap food .
8698,"My sons birthday party is held here every year.good pizza,friendly staff.the place is clean.good atmosphere for a bowling alley.i like this place and would recommend it to others"
8699,No newspaper
8700,Friendly cirtious most enjoyable.
8701,"Amazingly scrumptious, savory food. Tariq is friendly and accommodating"
8702,Chain steakhouse. Does what it says on the tin.
8703,They would get more stars if they werent so slow in the drive thru.  20+ min waiting for fast food is a bit much
8704,Just another Mall
8705,Very very good!!!!!!!!
8706,This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is delicious and the service is fast.
8707,Great place. Clean. Friendly staff. Able to make an appointment with no trouble. Definitely would recommend
8708,Worst Mexican in anchorage.
8709,"They have great prices and the atmosphere is very nice.
However, between the lack of customer service and quality of work I will never be going back there again."
8710,"The springs are AMAZING. The hotel could use a little update, but otherwise the staff is very friendly. Wifi is limited to by the day rates and has the tenancy to just go down. Food is pretty good at the resort restaurant, but the water is very sulfur tasting. Hightly suggest the tomato soup."
8711,"Bring your bug spray. This state campground is near the water and in the woods. After a good rain the mosquitos will carry you away . Tent camp sites are located in wooded areas. RV sites are a shared parking lot that can be cramped, lack of privacy, and difficult to back into.

Has all the typical State park features, drop box for camping fee, pit latrines, walking paths. Dogs require leashes."
8712,"Beautiful, serene peaceful"
8713,Check it out on Saturday night. The live entertainment will put a smile on your face.
8714,Great food and service
8715,Super place
8716,"great vibes, great coffee and good food. a bit of a wait but they are usually pretty busy so it's not a big deal. great baked goods as well."
8717,Awesome waitress and food!
8718,Like how relaxing it is waiting inside while waiting to board ferry.
8719,Mmmmm
8720,"Prices are very high for the portions and quality of the meals.  It smelled amazing, but actual consumption revealed it to be bland.  Kung Pao, even medium heat, has a kick.  This had none.  The Mongolian beef was too sweet for my liking, but I'm also fairly snotty when it comes to Chinese.  I wouldn't go here again based simply on the cost, but if price is no object, it would do for a fast meal for two."
8721,Always have what I am looking for.
8722,Great place for family fun
8723,"Rent clubhouse for weddings & receptions with a pond/mtn view! Gym, pool, spa, & pool table on premises for residents . Preschool at the Clubhouse."
8724,Nasty
8725,Manual car washes seem to be hard to find these days. They take credit cards - no need to find quarters! They have all the tools and functions you'd expect - no dryer.
8726,Great corner store. Friendly place. No mountain due tho :(
8727,"I come here most Saturday's in the fall because they host the official Oregon Ducks football watch parties. The staff has always been great to me. There is a decent beer selection, which is great. I love to get the pizza rolls (the marinara is amazing). If you're looking for a pizza, I'd recommend the Big Kahuna. And make sure to get the ice cream sandwich. Homemade brownies with vanilla Ghirardelli ice cream sandwiched in between. To die for. Go Ducks!"
8728,Fast service highly professional. brought in a new suit that needed to be tailored cleaned and pressed on a Friday picked it up the following Tuesday. It looks beautiful. Thank you so much.
8729,Waited 15 to 20 mins to get waited on.  Then manager waited on us.  Food was good.  Place was clean.  They have a nice gift shop also.  I felt that they were understaffed.
8730,Always beautiful & calming
8731,Best Wal-Mart in Kodiak....
8732,I have been going to this restaurant since I was little. They have great customer service. I love everything on the menu but they are especially known for their Reuben!
8733,What happened to Alaska land of my childhood 🤔
8734,"Trust me, eat the bacon, salami, lettuce and tomato sandwich! Friendly owners and a gorgeous setting. Well worth the stop or stay. Open during the depths of winter too!"
8735,Great safe place to target shoot.
8736,Good wash experience.  Considering the month pass.
8737,I have had some of the best luck finding things in this store. Not very big but friendly people and new stuff seems to come in often.
8738,"(Translated by Google) Very beautiful and immense, you feel small in a place like this.

(Original)
Muy bonito e inmenso,te sientes pequeño en un paraje como este."
8739,"It would be 5⭐ if the staff were more friendly, but I understand with the area why they are more stern & tend to seem more interested in getting you out of the store than possibility of increased sales."
8740,"Stopped in for lunch and some beers on our way out of town. This place is pretty big and looks brand new. We each ordered a flight of beer and we were not impressed (disclaimer - we are not beer people!) but the food was awesome!

I ordered the poutine and it was thick and rich. I think my wife got a flatbread and it was really good as well.

Highly recommended if you are in the area."
8741,Not sure why it is called dollar zone? Its a great place if your throwing a party and need throw away serving trays. You can also find kitchen gadgets for multiple dollars- mostly more dollars than other discount retailers.
8742,I just got one of their Orange Cream Milkshakes and in this Alaskan heat it was on point for 3.89 a medium shake will definitely be satisfying
8743,"Its McDonald's, what else can ya say.. quality really depends on who's working & if they like their job or not"
8744,"for me, it just didn't live up to the upscale image they're trying for. they have a good burger but it's really not worth the hassle of downtown and servers that act like they're better than the customers. maybe that's just my experience but that's my take on it."
8745,"They have knowledgeable staff, friendly and fun atmosphere. The staff was extremely helpful and assisted my son when he made a purchase in a informative, friendly and helpful manner. Excellent and unique spot for browsing for a firearm. Love the decor."
8746,An exceedingly efficient company with very friendly employees. I'll never go back to the DMV.
8747,Make your own buger and it's a about the size of 3 mcdoubles. It tastes great although they don't have very many signature burgers that they make.
8748,Good people who care about your pet for a good price
8749,The view I love it because so beautiful
8750,"There is a large variety of animals, and has a very well set-up, although there are many animals that aren't able to be there, but there's plenty for you to enjoy. Also I recommend to go during the winter, because the animals are more active so they can stay warm, and it won't be as busy."
8751,Liked.
8752,Fun for walk or playing around.
8753,A good place to let off some steam
8754,"Nice field, lots of goose poop."
8755,Great food....great price!!!  We visit whenever we get up to Fairbanks.
8756,This coffee hut is arguably the best one in town.
8757,"Good people, good service, and quality parts!"
8758,"Not really the best food, but very quick service."
8759,"Perhaps it was a one off night for them. I was expecting more from the number of positive reviews on here. It was not horrible but below average. Chips were not fresh and service was the real disappointment. Never had  ice tea refilled and salsa was only filled once. Food itself not up to par of several trips in Mexico as well as authentic cuisine from CA,Tx,Az, and Nm. Hoping for a better experience next time."
8760,Strange and spendy very different place with many people i have never seen before.
8761,"Love the food each and every time. The bathrooms are horrific,nasty every time we come in from the valley and stop to eat. There has not been a time you can even touch the stall doors they are always sticky.we  stopped goingfor awhile."
8762,"Expensive and very commercialized, the consession vendor has a capitalized monopoly on the area."
8763,"Our salesman, Will Sparrow was friendly, professional and available when we needed him. Staff is not pushy and will let you browse"
8764,"Our bartender Christina was the best bartender I've seen. Not only did she take great care of everyone sitting at the bar, but she made drinks for the entire restaurant. Busy worker bee for sure! Food was amazing but my drinks were the best :)"
8765,"Great selection of a variety of strains along with informative menu displays make shopping here easy. Beyond this, is the deli style service they offer here, a convenience that no other place in the Valley offers to my knowledge. It is this level of convenience and service that gets me coming back and also recommending to friends."
8766,"They have gas... and diesel fuel... and beer. And snacks.  Oh, and you can get heating fuel here. People are friendly. It's a self service gas station.  They have coffee. I think you can get an espresso in the mornings but there was only one attendant so I wouldn't bother them unless they have back up. Probably a bit over priced, but you save a drive into town."
8767,Clean well maintained
8768,"Excellent, original and eclectic Alaskan menu. Downtown and great for visitors!"
8769,"I got warm bread, Hot chicken and fresh salad!"
8770,Great service
8771,Alright food. Slow service if you're in a rush. Nice people and service.
8772,This place is not closed.  Hit the wrong button!!  Nice mall.
8773,"Good food, great service, moderately expensive but decent value"
8774,So peaceful and beautiful. The colors are amazing.
8775,Good fries
8776,Out off all fast food one of my favorites. Love the jalapeno thick burger.
8777,"C'mon folks McDonald's is McDonald's....

The only thing different from this visit then my last was

The customer service ......

They have improved since the last time and the workers where friendly prompt and respectful..... and cant forget fast...... thanks McDonald's"
8778,An absolutely fantastic place to go!
8779,Wish the employees were more strict about people cleaning their machines afterwards. I'm tired of cleaning dirty machines so I can use them. Please put up signs or something. Make people clean up after themselves. It's gross.
8780,Good grocery store
8781,Don't forget to resell your textbooks!
8782,"A small space, but very quiet and peaceful, especially if you want to do some reading or sketching. There is a koi pond, birds, and of course a plethora of plants. Warm, humid, and a good break from winter weather."
8783,Ok
8784,"You can tell why it's a neighborhood favorite as soon as the smell wafts through the doors when entering. Authentic, not Americanized, and so good. Just like my Asian grandma made it."
8785,I understand that it is fantastic when it is not raining and you can see the mountains.  Great people everywhere.
8786,I mean.....it's a store a typical store that has work gear nothing fancy but prices are outrageous.
8787,"I was at Golden Nugget RV Park to visit friends on Wednesday Nov.21. The park is exceptionally well-maintained. There is a small, but more than adequate, on-site laundromat. There are showers and restrooms as well. The staff is helpful and available."
8788,Nice and clean.  Very helpful people.
8789,"Confusing to navigate, don't really carry basic hobby tools like souldering iron tips."
8790,Very nice helpful employees always ready to assist you and seem to really care about you and your health needs. Much better than the service gotten at a chain pharmacy.
8791,"The flowers here are incredible, but the locals that hang out here may not be everyone's cup of tea."
8792,Food was not good service was ok she was nice
8793,"Loved it, kids still rave about the pool and breakfast. Dog friendly room was great."
8794,Extraordinary drive through the park.
8795,Excellent.
8796,"I would not return. Poor service, food was not that good. Very loud."
8797,"Well, when I was growing up, we didn't have such stores to go to for parts..Now we do at my 68th level in life..tee hee..I'm from the Top O The World by the way..The Last Frontier..Good day everyone,,"
8798,Poor selection
8799,"Great show. Medium sized venue, no bad seats. Note the show goes on rain or shine. Grandstand is covered, but if it is raining folks in the first 2-3 rows will get wet."
8800,"Great service,  great food, did a small flight of local craft beers which were all great! Wonderful experience with our waiter Chris! Ask for him!!!"
8801,Bomb dot com
8802,They almost always mess up any subs I do for ingredients unless I use the app. And then sometimes ordering through the app is unavailable. 🤷‍♀️
8803,Manager sounded like she was about to spit the biggest loogie of her life.  There fast but everything is thrown into the bags.  There main manager Rochell looks like she was hung over.
8804,It's just another Walmart
8805,Doesn't except smart wallet nor does the store have Alaksa Usa.
8806,Well lit easy to navigate and cleanly all staff and patrons were all masked up and practicing safe distancing!
8807,Super good food
8808,Very fast and efficient they did An awesome job will refer them to my friends!!!! Reasonably priced too!!
8809,Good drunken noodles and panang
8810,Great service... Food and drinks... Thanks for my 🎂 🍨
8811,"Tasty burgers, served fresh, bottomless french fries and tasty drinks. Our server was very good too."
8812,Typical gas station
8813,Best place for a beer and pool or shuffleboard.
8814,Easy to shop here friendly and knowledgeable staff!!
8815,"Taylored Restoration will give you an estimate and draw up an agreement only to Come back not only once, but twice after the project has started to make it “cheaper”. Less expensive flooring in the situation I’m referring to, not only once but after the project was started came back a second time with an even cheaper option.

Taylored will ONLY out one coat of paint on your walls

Taylored will NOT do any matching for transition strips from vinyl flooring to next

Taylored WILL leave cabinets unfixed to walls an unleveled

Taylored says they will send a final cleaner, however none of the ceiling fans in house were cleaned, cobwebs in the corners of ceiling from dust collecting, not a single window cleaned, adhesives left to the flooring from when they covered them to protect them

Only came in 7 weeks behind schedule & hear nothing but complaining coming from project manager Brian. Throughout the project I was monitoring for out of state friends, Brian (the project manager) treated me like literal garbage, abusive language towards his staff and customers, has a superiority complex, sucks at customer service & could clearly care less above finishing project in a timely and professional manner. A complete jerk!

I hope everyone at Taylored has to deal with a project where someone like Brian is their contact so they can see the level of customer service they are allowing their brand to represent.

Needless to say, if you’re able, save yourself the headache and go with another company.

There was only a single person doing the majority of the installation work. Was expected to do sheet rock, paint, trim, plumbing, electricity.

Essential the house was left abc competed with the bare minimum to finish the project.

Kitchen sink was left not completely hooked up and has a leak."
8816,Dependable knowledgeable reasonably priced
8817,Always excellent service!
8818,Prefect Carmel cappuccino and just the right blunt undertones without the Starbucks citrus yuck.
8819,"Clean and spacious, unique cafeteria style food setup that includes a coffee place."
8820,Mmmmm
8821,"ordered a brisket dinner, cost me $32 with grubhub, when it arrived there was not even 3 bites of meat in the box and the potatoes are undercooked in the potatoe salad, the $3 lemonade was yellow water, if it wasn't in a clear cup you would have no idea it was ""lemonade""
Appalled how management could let such sub bar food leave the kitchen. Also on the menu it says the brisket dinner comes with cornbread or a dinner roll, not neither as was the case with my order.. paid for it but sure didn't get what I paid for."
8822,Family friendly safe and good spot for recreational water vehicles
8823,"The food was fantastic! I had their mixed grill and it was a bit of everything. I think the lamb was my favorite. It was HUGE and served with two sauces, one tomato based the other was a curry base. The garlic naan was FANTASTIC! On the down side, service was a bit slow and we had to share a table as a couple... at 5:30pm. Not exactly what I had in mind, and I'm simply not in to that ""community table"" thing, so it was a turnoff for me. I even called to make a reservation and they told me ""no problem at 5:30, no reservation needed"". Oh well, the food was great though!"
8824,"Had the smoked salmon chowder and a pizza and both were fantastic!  Service was great and although there isnt a lot of seating, we only had to wait about 10 minutes to sit down.  Cant wait to go again for halibut and chips as the table next to us ordered it and they looked delicious!!"
8825,It's not the Wings the Phillies. Are to dry
8826,Our waiter was excellent. Very clean and seating appropriately. Food was great
8827,Great mall
8828,My grandchild enjoyed the week stay here! Very quaint
8829,Easy and fast. Lot is kept clean and ice free
8830,Just what I need
8831,The food and ambiance were both very nice. I will definitely go back again.
8832,Shawn Idom at hair science has created not just a Barbershop and Barber School but a community! He goes above and beyond for all of his clients and provides outstanding service. He is always looking for better ways to serve people and better his shop. I highly recommend you schedule an appointment today!

8840,"If you go early, you will get out quicker!"
8841,"(Translated by Google) Sloooooooow!

(Original)
Sloooooooow!"
8842,One of the best parks for outdoor activities. Not many parks have a Beach on the ocean. This is a year round park for people who love to be outdoors.
8843,"This particular Carrs is a mega-Carrs. In fact, I have yet to get over to the west end of the store. Clean with friendly people and a fantastic deli, I will drive across town to come to this location."
8844,Good food. Service was great.
8845,Mashed potatoes tasted like baked potatoes.
8846,Great hikes beautiful views
8847,"Spectacular views, drive, hiking trails!! Watch out for Moose if you chose to hike,  follow the guidelines of Nature Center;In case you encounter wild life. Paradise for bird photographers. There's this 30 mile drive from visitor Center into the park preserve. I could spot fewer species of birds. Watch out for weather news before planning this trip."
8848,Everything you need
8849,I love the foods available here variety with multicultural selectuon.
8850,Love grilled onions on burger! Great fries
8851,Great halloween place
8852,It is a lovely botanical garden with a wonderful variety of plants!
8853,Herb garden
8854,The kids say it's the best park in Anchorage.  It has the added dog park and my dog enjoys that.
8855,Drop off you old electronics for recycling here. They were great about taking all kinds of old gear and getting it properly processed for recycling.
8856,Not healthy
8857,Ok
8858,It was a small group but a good NA meeting all in all the people were friendly and the building was easy to find with the assistance of Google maps
8859,Great place
8860,Very knowageable helpful and professional people. Filled and loaded my order very fast. With great service like this I will be back! Thanks employees of Lowe's!
8861,Iam not into processed foods.
8862,for GOOD service sit in the BAR.  If you want terrible to mediocre service sit in the other part.   Food is not bad.  Pizza is good.  Enjoy eating there now I know where to sit to get good service.   Takeout can be hit or miss.
8863,"Beautiful park in Ester, Alaska. Was pretty packed when we visited and hard to practice social distancing, but could have just gone at a busy time. Plenty of things for kiddos to do for a great outdoor pastime. Highly recommend checking this hidden gem out. Only about 8 minutes drive from Fairbanks."
8864,Always a friendly experience.
8865,Quick service
8866,There going downhill food is ok but no deserts like they use to have no more soft service ice cream they got tubs of ice cream that the kids were sticking there fingers in to taste test.
8867,Lots of outdoor activities!
8868,"My wife and I typically don’t buy cars from small dealerships, but we are certainly glad we did!
These guys went above and beyond to make sure we got the truck we wanted at a fair price. Our sales rep Brenden Farley was honest, straightforward and made sure everything was done in a timely manner. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and we will definitely consider them in the future!"
8869,Great place.
8870,Drive through is so quick and easy.
8871,Helpful & knowledgeable
8872,"This is for the restuarant.. I ordered a 52 dollar porterhouse steak. I was really thinking it would be something special. Wrong. It was the most un-exciting steak I have ever had. There was a few grill marks in it, other than that it just looked like a cardboard colored piece of meat. Taste? Meh it was okay, I at least think it was fresh. I'm not even sure there was salt on it. I really wanted to put steak sauce on it.  It came with a little puddle of mashed potatoes and 3 asparagus. Sorry no photo."
8873,Customer service is ok. Employees got irritated when I price matched there item to AutoZone and it was $60 cheaper at AutoZone for the same thing.
8874,"We had a big company party.    Close to 20 people.      They had orders taken and food out in around 30 minutes. Very impressed.     Food was good, and hot.   Everyone was happy.    Thank you!"
8875,"Foolishly did business with these crooks after repeated warnings from multiple people.
Low down thieves!"
8876,Good store
8877,"(Translated by Google) The first Starbucks I saw in my life with a fireplace

(Original)
毕生见到的第一个有壁炉的星巴克 里面还算大 可以休闲"
8878,I booked a trip for the glaciers and security  comes bothering me on 9-25-2015 and said that I couldn't say in the lobby and wait
8879,"Everything you need for fishing, boat repairs, home improvement, and houswares."
8880,Nice location helpful staff
8881,"The playground is geared towards kids between 2-8 years of age. Nothing amazing, put a small fun place to hangout. During the winter they have ice skating, which is well maintained and our go to place!!!"
8882,It's a good Freddy's
8883,Great sushi. Delicious Mongolian beef. You Get what you pay for.
8884,Nice little comfortable theater
8885,Very good place to eat. Friendly staff and a variety of entrees for adults and family. Definitely a great place to eat anyday.
8886,"Great mall, lots of good stores"
8887,It was a little slow but expected so ok
8888,Beautiful building
8889,Low income neighborhood with a lot of sketchy people living in it. The community is well laid out and seems well managed. But the crime rate is really high.
8890,"Fun, amazing sledding! Beautiful!"
8891,Nostalgic and great price.
8892,Love the meats here
8893,"The best sushi place in Anchorage and one of the best that I’ve been to in the US. Consistently fresh and generous sashimi cuts. Great selection of udon and other Japanese food as well. Only downside is that it can be crowded during popular times, but there is usually space at the bar. Highly recommended."
8894,Really only the only Mall
8895,"There wood stove pizza is amazing! And if they dont have a pizza on the menu for you, you can totally ask for toppings and build your own."
8896,Its okay.
8897,Gorgeous
8898,They had a wonderful selection and great food. It was nice to be able to go eat at a place where having a food allergy was understood and easy to find options.
8899,Excellent assortment of meats and excellent prices!
8900,Overpriced for the quality
8901,"The best dry rubbed ribs I've ever had. I've been to barbecue places from Alaska to Miami. Super tender and moist. No need for bbq sauce, though there in house choices are pretty tasty. Their chicken thighs are also very tasty. Good thing I live 160 miles away or I'd be fat and poor - but I'd be happy!"
8902,Great food.good people.nice seanary.
8903,"Good food, hidden gem."
8904,Nice park
8905,Great tasty meals and very nice service
8906,"A locals favorite. Owners Raleigh and Jenny serve up creative, fresh and delicious modern American fare. Decor is light and friendly just like the service. Excellent coffees and homemade fresh pastries everyday. Menu is constantly changing offering new experiences regularly for very reasonable prices."
8907,"Still beautiful, sadly extremely empty for the mall part. To the stores in them you are amazing!!"
8908,"Love home depot, the location isn't all that great. But they have great service and their prices are somewhat affordable. There garden and lawn section is my favorite area."
8909,"Great service, enjoyable front desk interaction, hairdresser was fantastic..great prices and great haircut"
8910,"Nice, very clean."
8911,Love love love this place
8912,Food and staff are good but prices are ridiculous. Wife and 2 kids and cost me over 100$ for dinner. This is not a fancy place to eat.
8913,Amazing acoustics!
8914,Love the view and the drinks.
8915,Nice outdoor seating with live music.
8916,Best bar in Seward
8917,Thanks had a good visit with friends! Keep em in line Jake!
8918,"Great hotel with an amazing staff, awesome views and just a quick walk to shopping and fine dining!"
8919,This is my favorite sushi spot. You get alot for your money and I leave full every time.
8920,"WOW where to start. I pulled up and there had to be 500+ mowers snow blowers and other things sitting around. I waited around for 15 minutes because I guess the owner and his helper were more interested in getting his car washed than doing their job. I showed him a part that i needed fixed he said it was a cheap Chinese piece of crap and it was ruined. He followed that with go home brush up on my Chinese and get a new one off the internet. I asked if happened too have one that was compatible sitting around that might work, he looked around his Sanford and son's parking lot and said yes, but I am not going to look for it go home. He was a real ass to say the least had no people skills and apparently very little to no small engine repair knowledge also. found the part at anchorage small engine repair and had it fixed in less than 3 minutes when i got home. Save yourself time and money just avoid this place."
8921,Good but a bit over priced.
8922,We walked in and the first couple of people didn't offer assistance.  Then we got help from a very nice female associate.  Who helped us get everything setup.
8923,"Just a visitors perspective... Breakfast burrito was good... Reindeer sausage was like everywhere else that serves it, must be one supplier in the area. The menu leans strong vegan, if that's your thing, you're in the right place. The table of 4 behind us had sweets and pastries and were not satisfied, lady (mom) said, ""worst, grossest carrot cake in the world, it's almost tasteless!"" The man took it all back to the counter. The cashier taking the order seemed angry, looked very unhappy. Looking around at other people's food, meh. If I resided here, I probably wouldn't dine here. I really preferred the Snow City Cafe over this place for breakfast, seemed a lot easier to communicate our order and we actually had smiling service."
8924,Excellent customer service. Very fast windshield replacement.
8925,Good patrons good tips
8926,Never returned calls
8927,Very helpful. Great customer service. Someone always asks if you need help
8928,Good coffee
8929,Great hike but bears kill people on this trail in 2017
8930,Always a treat when we go to Anchorage!
8931,Fine place like every other hallmark I've been to
8932,Amazing place to learn about animal conservation/preservation and get up close and personal.
8933,"Fun, fun, fun with fantastic baked goods."
8934,"I love the scenic views behind the plaza. Inside has semi-ok shopping, not to browse but if you're looking for specifics."
8935,Fast friendly service
8936,Lots of variety... and love it!.
8937,"Love the glow in the dark lights. There's an alcoholic and non drinking side
Wasn't sure if there's a place to get something to eat as well. As the only 2 places looked as though they only served alcohol from being on the drinking side past the barriers. Happened to be next to very enthusiastic people who yelled in cheer each time one of their 8 people made a strike which was every other time so ended up getting a major headache from them. Other than that, a great place for kids, a fence thing goes up for kids so the bowling ball won't end up in the gutter. Unlimited amount of rounds, just pay for the hours. They provide white socks to wear with the shoes to help further prevent athletes foot and foot fungus."
8938,"Pretty nice place the main lady who is usually serving is very nice, the food doesn't take too long and it's pretty good."
8939,"Loved our experience. We called and were able to schedule a same day temperament test so our pup could have a doggie play date instead of having to stay in the hotel in his kennel. They were super sweet, helpful and he had a great time. They even had Frontline on hand for him to ensure that he wouldn't come home with any ""extra"" friends. This place is fantastic and we'll definitely be using them again on our next visit down from Fairbanks!"
8940,"Yummy rice bowls full of fresh veggies, served fast by friendly staff. A bit spendy, but worth it for the quantity and quality of the food."
8941,"They rarely have the parts in stock that I need even though I own a subaru, one if the most common vehicles on the island.  But they are cheaper than napa."
8942,Best option on the peninsular! Great sound and picture.
8943,Very kid friendly!
8944,"The food was a little less than awesome, but the service was nice, and we enjoyed our time."
8945,"After having some pretty disappointing food on our trip to Fairbanks (no disrespect, Fairbanks, but I hope we just didn't find the good options), we came here for dinner on our last full day.  It was simple, but kind of perfect.  It wasn't just the contrast that made it stand out, either.  I started wondering how I could start a place like this back home, which I will admit to doing a couple times in the past, but it isn't a regular occurrence.
Honestly, we were cautious in Fairbanks.  We wear our masks everywhere, not because we are worried for ourselves, but because it is the socially accepted right thing to do right now.  We walked into several places and felt unwelcome, mostly related to this.  We felt more welcomed here than anywhere else we went, and that meant a lot.  The food was excellent, as well.  As I said, it is simple, but it is done right.  The ingredients are fresh and balanced, and so is the menu.  The options range from vegetarian and healthier to more indulgent.  It was not a difficult decision to go back the next day before our flight home for lunch, and we won't make another trip to Fairbanks without stopping here."
8946,Great friendly service!
8947,Bernie
8948,"The crew at this location is the best!!! Quintin,Miguel, and Cheyenne are great. I start my morning with them offering great service and fresh food."
8949,Love this Lake!
8950,Great service easy in and out
8951,Buffet is great and food is delicious and 🔥 hot all you can eat is clean and personnel is there to assist whatever you need will go back again and again 😀
8952,best coffee I was able to find in alaska during my vacation.
8953,Got my truck right in and got the estimate done within 45 minutes.
8954,"Its consistently cold this winter, which is a nice upgrade compared to years past. Plus this year's fireworks were awesome!"
8955,Decent Alaskan venue with an open bar. Seems good for groups.
8956,Sports themed sandwich shop.  Taste good and the new sandwich maker will be awesome soon.  Lots of toppings you get to apply so decide how much of each.
8957,Great chocolate!
8958,Went to wash the car but the only thing working was the soap brush.
8959,"Cabellas is a mini adventure.   I have almost always been greeted with amazing customer service and knowledgeable employees.   One of my favorite places to shop, right after Bass Pro Shop 😉"
8960,Really cool & cozy atmosphere
8961,The cashier did not put my chicken sandwich in with my order.  I felt ripped off.  First I thought she did not charge me me for it. But she did.
8962,Good place to do business with. Clean and friendly.
8963,Great Food!
8964,The PadThai meal was great.
8965,Great ice cream
8966,Great burgers but I think they got much smaller than the last time we came
8967,"This was a amazing place. Been to Whittier a number of times, but the first time at Emerald Cove.  A great and beautiful place."
8968,"Ordered delivery, the man was very nice, but our food was just ok & took, what seemed like forever, to get here. The Queen Tostada we ordered was missing the salsa, & the sour cream was sweet for some reason? The tamales didn't have a corn husk? Never seen that before, not a big deal tho, but there was no chips & salsa either? Isn't chips & salsa a given at any Mexican restaurant, even when you order to-go/delivery?"
8969,Hot dogs😍
8970,Very great service from our waitress and the manager. Nice wine selection. Pricey but you do get what you pay for. Excellent place to eat and relax.
8971,Very helpful and wonderful service
8972,Decent fast food. Normal Alaskan price
8973,"Whale watching was great, no bears though."
8974,Come here for fresh made tea hot or on ice & is always so delicious along with the Staff who serve you they are always so friendly & kind & ask exactly how you want your tea made!  Should be called Sweet Summit...  Love this place!
8975,For the type of place it is there are some decent quality clothes
8976,Cabela's is a great store for everything from clothes to guns and everything in between. Very helpful staff. And a very interesting thing like a mini aquarium. And Cabela's has a useful Truck/RV Parking area on the side of the building. Great for people who are coming down from the Mat-Su Valley and interior Alaska who are going on to the Kenai Peninsula as Cabela's is right near the Seward Highway. I Greatly recommend this place.
8977,Amanda or Amelia and the lady who takes your picture made the whole DMV experience amazing. They were so helpful and understanding and just overall friendly and happy ladies. Thank you both for the best DMV experience I have ever had.
8978,Amazing church and amazing people I been going here for almost 4 years and I love it. Very dedicated people.
8979,Very nice small cozy place with a wide variety of dishes. Very nice staff I recommend Royal 🇹🇭 Thai.
8980,Feels like the food quality has gone down over the past few months...
8981,If you're looking for a great local bar on the weekends this is the spot to be.
8982,It was ok
8983,I think the prices are way to high for used items.  I saw several items I could get new at Wal-Mart for less money then they had there!
8984,Great veterans day program! Thank you so much for supporting our vets and military members!
8985,Loved it
8986,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, good food. A Girdwood staple. Family friendly."
8987,Beautiful presentation. Attentive service. All our courses were perfectly prepared. Chef spent a lot of time on the main floor.
8988,Folks do there job well
8989,Love the little church.  Been going for years
8990,you can find name brands here
8991,Got love Costco.  Buy in bulk an save some coin. Plus they have everything.

8995,"I like the food, their Monday burger special is a steal! Prices seem a little steep on other things."
8996,Great car wash. Love on Wednesdays they give part of proceeds to pet charities.
8997,"We pulled in here after driving up from Homer and being in the car for 8 hours. We had such an unwelcome welcome we almost got back in the car to go back to Homer. The owner who we had been talking to on the phone was the nicest man and we were so looking forward to our experience in Denali. What we experienced on arrival was not what we experienced during the booking. We were under the impression that we would be able to book our excursions with the front desk staff but then we were told no and that maybe they could help at the park. We were told the closest place for food other than the food trucks was back a few miles or into Heely where was a Brewery or grocery store. Unfortunately or stay never got better. Our key didn’t work multiple times and somehow this was our fault.

We ended up figuring things out for ourselves and had a great trip but with no help from Grizzly Bear. I hate to even leave a bad review but we saved and spent a lot of money for this trip and the staff here at Grizzy Bear really made this a very bad experience, I expected more. I expected better."
8998,Such good service. They didn't have a booth for me to sit my car seat in but immediately improvised and flipped over a high chair so we could settle it in. Food was amazing as well.
8999,It's a market
9000,Nice peaceful land mark downtown
9001,"Great prices and product. If you haven't been, go right now!"
9002,Great food and drinks.
9003,Great late night snack!
9004,It's great to deal with a business where the staff know their stuff. Great company.
9005,One of tge best hotels in Anchorage. Right in the heart of downtown. Alot of tourism stuff available down town. Very clean and Friendly staff.
9006,"Walked in to find out information.  The one sales associate who was there was sitting on top of the counter top playing with his phone. He looked up to say hi but didn't get up to ask us what we needed.  Walked over to him and asked him if he worked there since he seemed so relaxed.  I also wasn't sure since he wasn't wearing anything that said Cricket. No name tag, shirt, nothing.  He said it's always relaxed at that location and that's how things are there.  On the plus side he did seem to know his information regarding the questions we asked even though he was continually playing with his phone while he was answering our questions.

My wife was so turned off from this type of service that after we left we figured we would forget Cricket altogether.  Just to give them one more chance we went to another Cricket location, and it was a totally different experience.  Was told by this other Cricket employee that they hear complaints similar to ours about this Muldoon location, and that the Muldoon location and the Wasilla location have different owners so it could be that the types of standards are different."
9007,Like it
9008,It’s worth driving out for this theater
9009,Not a salmon... But a fish nevertheless. Cool little beach at low tide you can walk out to the rocks and around the point.
9010,Great medical care
9011,Excellent coffee and cozy atmosphere.
9012,Great place to see fish
9013,This place has really good food and is probably the closest I will get to getting my Chipotle fix since there are no Chipotle's up here.  I'm probably here about once a month lately so it's worth it.
9014,"Great little park with nice view, minus the occassinal homeless."
9015,Very delicious food and a great modern feel which both contrast the majority of so many places to eat around here
9016,Cute park
9017,Service was good but a little pricey
9018,Very good food and they have grits!!
9019,Cashier and security guard were nice
9020,"Adequate amenities, very busy bus hub. Laundry facilities not great"
9021,Stayed in Cottonwoods with a nice view of the river. Great food and great views at both restaurants.
9022,Food was good. Accurate order and fast service
9023,"The girls used to be so sweet, now they just seem to hate their job."
9024,"Best quick chinese place in town, and the only place that sells Milk bread in loaves. They're the only ones to sell steam buns and all the portions are HUGE. Bring a friend to share. It's nice to eat alone but better is everyone is sharing food with eachother.
The desserts aren't too sweet, which is nice. Not sugar filled. It's very much like how it is back in asia."
9025,Nice walking trail just ensure you have bug spray the mosquitoes are bad.
9026,Educational and entertaining.
9027,"Dirty, poor selection"
9028,"If you like bulk, this is the place for you!"
9029,Fast friendly service.
9030,"Prices at safeway in North Pole and Fairbanks area,  seem to be higher than other stores.  Living in North Pole and using safeway there,  there are usually lines because they have at least 2-3 registers closed.  Always seems to be after everyone is out of work. I don't like there deli.  I love chicken wings,  but their wings always seem to be over cooked and dried out."
9031,One of the best playgrounds in Anchorage for kids. Plus no homeless or druggies around like some of the other parks.
9032,did I say pot is good? I forgot... pot is good.
9033,"Great service and wonderful authentic Thai food!
Their Panang Curry 🍛 is my absolute favorite and they do it right here!
Definitely a good change from the ever popular buffet upstairs! 😉"
9034,"Helpful staff, and they price match what ever the website says so you can look up a SKU and pay that ."
9035,Ordered nachos with shredded beef. Clumbs of meat with a little burnt cheese atop burnt nachos. The cook did a terrible nachos.
9036,"The food was too expensive for whst you received. Cost $80 for 3 beers, chicken and broccoli fettuccine, a chicken breast with a portabello mushroom gravy, and 2 cups of soup. You are paying extra to for the building because it is in the National Register of Historic places. The food was good just over priced."
9037,"Consistently excellent food and service. Whether dining alone, or with a date, or kids, or a large group, I have always felt welcome and enjoyed my visit"
9038,"Beautiful place, clean and we'll maintained. Long friggin bus ride."
9039,You know what you're getting here.
9040,Awesome place to find a totally great meal.
9041,Very convenient
9042,Friendly staff
9043,Pretty views
9044,"(Translated by Google) Very good hotel A bit expensive in season, especially if traveling on a budget. But it is worth the effort to make the effort. Large and well equipped rooms with a luxury bathroom. Recommended. And very close to the Denali national park.

(Original)
Muy buen hotel. Un poco caro en temporada, especialmemte si se viaja con poco presupuesto. Pero vale la.pena hacer el esfuerzo. Cuartos amplios y bien equipados con un baño de lujo. Recomendado.  Y muy cerca del.parque nacional Denali."
9045,"$40 for a haircut is too expensive. I can't even see the difference, she just cute a little bit and she was moving so fast, she finished in 10 min."
9046,Totally disappointed. OUT of Pot Pies and Famous Bowls.  After waiting 10 minutes I was told it would be another 16 minutes for my original recipe bucket to be ready. Place was not that busy.  Will not be going back.
9047,A great place to eat they have good breakfast they have good burgers and your waitresses are so great at their job
9048,Best wings in the valley and great pizza too.
9049,Delicious mexican food
9050,"Best pizza in Alaska, period.  Always hot, fresh, and delivered with a quickness.  Thank you!"
9051,"Needs more parking, or the parking needs to be monitored more often. Stayed here and the restaurant took up every single parking. Other than that the security is awesome and watches all doors to make sure only guest are welcome which is a plus being next to open bars."
9052,The burgers were delicious and my daughter actually ate her corn dog. Worth the prices.
9053,Delicious food.
9054,CBD oil for insomnia and pain relief very pricey..l hope it works out for me it 9:08 im still awake from last night🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 $140.00
9055,"BJ's is great, not b the cleanest parking lot."
9056,c a c a
9057,"Horrible service. Chips were stale. We literally had to hail down our waitress, never did get a glass of water. Now I know why I haven't been there in 10 years."
9058,Very happy  they did just what I asked for  love the new color
9059,Wish they have more sales very expensive
9060,Best burger in Juneau hands down.
9061,"We spent 3 wonderful days at this resort, the hot springs were crystal clear and toasty warm to hot depending where you soaked at. Just a heads up don’t forget to drink as much water as you can, the hot water dehydrates you very quickly! Bring your water bottle, you can refill it in the building where you checked in. There is a lot to do if you want or just relax and unwind. To cool off visit the Ice museum on the property a cool 26f. And very beautiful and unique. This resort is off the grid only Verizon and ATT cell coverage works here what I have been told. We were very blessed to meet the owner Berni sp? And his family. Unfortunately he lost his wife in January and they were having a celebration of life for his wife. What a wonderful man he is and his family.  Sending prayers to his family.  The resort is a work in progress, and progress takes work what he said.  The new hotel covered entry way and drive way was getting paved when we were there in mid Aug . The hotel rooms are nice like camp rooms, don’t expect 5 stars here maybe 3. The restaurant has amazing tasting food, 40 % of the food is grown in the green house and garden.  Ooh, bring shoes that you don’t mind getting a little dirty, paved and in paved areas if you walk around a bit. And hiking shoes if you want to do some hiking.  Lastly friendly staff ."
9062,This place is so run down and poorly managed. Everytime I make an appointment and show up on time they still take an extra 20 minutes to see me. Like what is the point of making appointments if you don't even see your patients on time? On top of that they said they'd have my test results in about a day but it took them over a week to actually get them.
9063,We had pizza and salmon sandwich on brioche buns.  Good good and outside seating has view of harbour.  Only draw back is that Hostess staff is not organized or able to predict wait times.
9064,"I loved my steak bowl! Friendly service and delicious, delicious food."
9065,Fresh chicken
9066,It's energetic and the host and servers are genuine. I love there food and desserts. I could eat there for a lifetime.
9067,Excellent staff and maintained very well.
9068,Outstanding food and incredible service!
9069,"Always professional staff, food is very good."

9075,It's great paint and awesome service
9076,Great place very helpfull people
9077,"Paid too much for food that tasted like it was thrown into a microwave. However, the service was wonderful and welcoming."
9078,Added an antenna to a tower.
9079,Try the Gyros! Great service and nice ambience.
9080,Exceot it would have been so so so much better if I coulda or woulda won some $$$$ @ BINGO tonight. Lol so much for beginners luck..
9081,Great place to lose the time...but your money as well 😉
9082,"Lots of products, good price, friendly staff, very clean facility."
9083,One of the very few places in the valley that you can get stuff in bulk
9084,Stickers!
9085,"Love the jalapeno burger, onion rings and potatoe skins!!"
9086,My husband and I have eaten here twice. Once we picked up and once delivery. The staff are pretty cool and the prices aren't bad but the food is pretty mediocre. Not a lot of flavor amd tortillas taste like microwaved store bought. Not bad in a pinch I guess.
9087,"Convenient, had Starbucks...good...a variety of stores."
9088,Wee bit over priced.
9089,"Nice quality staff, good managers. Great service not many mistakes & when the mistakes do happen the managers are quick to fix employees mistakes."
9090,Didn't find what I was looking for.
9091,"Great food, great prices. Fish was delicious."
9092,Very good cocktails.
9093,Always luv shopping here .. plus they offer a military discount
9094,"Better now than last year. Food tasted great and good portions. Service was a little slow, but very nice. We will definitely return as this is a Fairbanks classic."
9095,Good food
9096,Ive been shopping here for 10 years. Awesome customer service from shopping to delivery. Quick and painless!!!
9097,Great place and very helpful but very pricey.
9098,Very boring place
9099,Huge selection of extreme weather jackets and other outdoor goodies. This is a wonderful historic location in fairbanks.
9100,Great service and food!!!
9101,I walked into steam dot to buy a sandwich and coffee for a hungry elder and was not greeted in fact I was ignored all together when I finally got someones attention I felt they only served me to get us to leave. The whole time I was there the woman working kept looking in our direction with what looked like discussed on her face. It was difficult to get any service at all if the elder gentleman I was with could have walked to a different place so I could buy him food I would not have stayed. A gentleman told me that he would not sell me a gift card for that elder because he does not want to discourage others from coming to his establishment. He claimed the elder had defiled his restroom before and he would not serve him again. He only said that when the gentleman I was with sat down away from ear shot making me mistrust him statements. When other customers entered they were greeted and someone was right there to help them. I feel disrespected and I believe that we were treated unfairly.
9102,We came to eat here after seeing the great reviews and we were not disappointed! Our burgers and sides were fresh and delicious. Our server had great customer service and was friendly and attentive. This will definitely be one of our go to spots in Fairbanks.
9103,Great place to go if you need anything fixed.
9104,"Pretty decent alaskan shop for tourist check it out and see everything they have to offer, all of 4th Ave is a trap 😉"
9105,"An Alaskan tradition! Delicious food and fun gifts, and forget to check out the giant chocolate fountain."
9106,"Great activity's and play structure, awesome river that runs through the park."
9107,"Great burgers, delicious milkshakes. On sunny summer days you can sit outside next the the creek. Beware - they are cash only, but there's an ATM on site."
9108,"Food was delicious, though service was a bit slow."
9109,Staff was kind of rude to me and my 2 kids and wife. All we wanted was a table for 4 and dinner.
9110,"All Lowes are pretty much the same. They have just about everything you need, and if you look around for a few minutes,  you will find it thanks to Lowes easy floor plan. Help is a little hard to find, but once you can flag down an employee, they will stay by your side, instead of just pointing you in the general direction. I like that a lot."
9111,"Mmmmm, our breakfast here was amazing. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was one of the best I ever had."
9112,A lot of spaces  to sit if you don't like crowds
9113,"Bartender made awesome shots.  Seemed like less ""riff raff"" that night.  👍👍"
9114,Good prices and good service. Got what I needed and more than I planned. Glad to see the face mask requirement during the global pandemic.
9115,Not much of a menu
9116,The store in Soldotna was very helpful in closing my account with them. I was switching providers.
9117,"Beautiful simple decor, cozy. Very clean facility. Staff is friendly, pleasant, knowledgeable! Definitely going back!"
9118,You can always find what you need.Remember $5.00 Friday the last day of the year.
9119,Family owned
9120,Good place
9121,Great food and service!!
9122,It's Taco Bell fast food.
9123,Very nice park and clean
9124,Save your time and money!
9125,Crazy but awesome place
9126,I am giving this review a two star and not a one star based only on how the chicken salad sandwich I ordered being pretty good. I ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a Sourdough toasted provolone chicken salad sandwich. I was brought a cup of clam chowder and a chicken salad on 9 grain bread cold no cheese. I sent back the clam chowder for the bowl and then quickly wished I had kept the cup as the chowder tasted like it came out of a can. I wont be coming back.
9127,Comfy
9128,"Amazing amazing amazing. Made a reservation for our wedding anniversary, not only were we seated right away, but at the table there was a happy anniversary card and little bits of ribbon. Everything from the cocktails to dessert was mouthwatering and to die for, and for being a fancy restaurant the prices were really very good. I highly recommend and we will he going again"
9129,"Amazing place. A must visit for nature lovers. Highlights are watching whales, Bald eagle, Glaciers, iceberg etc"
9130,"Beautiful sights, though multiple times ive gone there I've smelt the odor of marijuana."
9131,it's ok as long as u don't plan on having fun its quite full of shady people and bad thikngs
9132,"It's a bar, it has awesome pool tables, no food served here, great bartenders."
9133,The food was good! The inside needs to be remodeled and thoroughly cleaned. Workers were all nice. Thank you to all of the workers.
9134,"First time we ate there was ok. 2nd time we ate there food was bad and I got sick on it. We stayed in the camp ground with our little slide in truck camper,  charged $25.00 electric only, later found out that you needed a code to use the bath room and we would have to pay extra for that. By then the office was closed so we could not get into the toilet or wash room. Will not go there again !!!"
9135,Decent across the board from food to service and speed.
9136,"The new burger replacement; not impressed. The playland was stinky; like it hadn't been wiped down for days; tables needed wiped down,  the floor had food on it. When a staff was brought in; he just looked at what the complaints were and walked back to the kitchen. Nothing was done. We left."
9137,"One of the things I apprechiate about Anchorage is the variety of international cuisine available here. Asian cuisine and gourmet Ramen is some of my favorite dishes in the world. I tried their Naruto Miso Ramen dish. On point with some of the best I've had in Asia. The tasty eggs and the broth were delishes! I was slurping in style. Next I took my waitress's advice and went with a Beef and Chicken curry. Full disclosure, I will destroy CoCo's curry any chance I get. Naruto's curry surpassed CoCos in taste, quality and quantity. Naruto's has earned a spot in my heart and I will be back!"
9138,I have eaten here twice in the last month. I had a chicken club the first time and a chili cheese coney the second visit. They were as good as I remembered. The strawberry sweet is great.
9139,Worst experience of my life and paid a lot for no help at all. The team who was to help me said were sorry we dont know what to tell you. Stay away from this practice.  They are rude at counter when entering and just dont care about you.
9140,"I love this place, they have State of the art gym and anything else you need to get you fit on.
Jacobs lader is one of my fav. You do need a military ID to get on base or gym or have a friend take you in who dies have a id."
9141,"Newly opened, first of its kind, drive though"
9142,Rooms are spectacular and the view is amazing. Received a couples deep tissue massage with my girlfriend from Sondra and Rizzo at the Spa. They were very professional and we both left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. Room service in the morning was prompt and delicious. Will stay again in the future.
9143,"Their staff is always friendly and helpful when you need them to be without hovering over you. There is a large variety of items, many things that the large box stores don’t have and they carry quality items. It’s a great place to wander around in and discover new things and get those hard to buy for people gifts."
9144,"Unique and great experience. I recommend visiting the sealive center before going on a sea boat tour, to educate yourself on the wildlife before hand."
9145,"Wide variety of name brand and Alaskan-themed stores. Very nice mall, lots of options in the food court as well. Fairly helpful staff, a decent amount of parking, and the mall is pretty clean. The stairwell stinks, but that's not a major problem. Nice layout, as well."
9146,Awesome ride and awesome staffing!  The only way to travel when you're looking for a relaxing ride from Ketchikan to the magic of Price of Wales island.  Don't forget to get a tasty snack on your ride!
9147,"Beautiful airport, bright, clean, as far as airport's go it is warm, inviting and a bit eclectic.  Depending what direction you land there are some spectacular views.  We were pleasantly surprised and impressed  in our welcome to Alaska.  Enjoy."
9148,"When pedicurist wasn't able to sell me what she was pushing, the result was a poor pedi."
9149,"Romantic decor, great food."
9150,Good food. Fairly quick. Employees are nice and COVID-19 safety measures are appreciated. 😊👍👍
9151,Clean and friendly
9152,They can order most parts and have most of the basics for oil changes on motorcycles
9153,"Great customer service! I usually call ahead to pick up my order, their team is quick and friendly!"
9154,"This is a wonderful park, plenty of trails, shade, open areas.  Typically not crowded at all.  Ski, sled, bike and some golf even."
9155,Clean store with reasonably priced groceries.
9156,"Good was ok, nothing special. The service left much to be desired. The restaurant was maybe half full but people were waiting to be seated for at least 10 minutes. They could have been short staffed, but if you're interested in pizza, just go to Moose's Tooth."
9157,"Nice place to pop in and eat. We had thia tea, thai coffee, pho, drunken noodles, larb and fresh spring rolls. Everything was great, but the pho broth tasted like a pre-made mix. The service was fantastic and the place was clean."
9158,Great team of folks working there... Very knowledgeable
9159,"I had a terrific experience. The place is clean, well lit and reasonably taken care of.  They use high quality synthetic grass on the bottom floor soccer field which is a pretty good size, too.

Recommended for both adults and children."
9160,"We had a tour with a park ranger, so we got to go further into park and preserve than private cars are allowed to go. We still only went 25 miles in: park is 5.2 Million acres. Totally natural, no efforts made to socialize wild life, they live - and die - with no interference from humans. We saw eagles, both bald and golden, moose, caribou and artic ground squirrels.  And lots and lots of magnificent scenery!"
9161,Good store
9162,"Nice place to chill, but overly pretentious, hipster."
9163,"HELL YEAH! Pool, darts, food, and ash trays! Plenty of room for groups too."
9164,"Low on bike inventory like other bike shops due to the current situation, but great, knowledgeable, and helpful staff. Will purchase another bike here in the near future."
9165,Love the deals
9166,Try their pizza! Highly recommended - almost as good as Moose's Tooth's
9167,"We've been to Skagway before and we've done White Pass, and we wanted a different experience, so we opted for the Douglas Glacier paddle adventure.... WOW.... What a great day. You start with a 40 minute boat ride. We saw seal, see lions, eagles, a whale and several other interesting things. They stopped at a beautiful waterfall for us to photograph.
Upon arrival near the Glacier, we walked for less than 10 minutes where we boarded the canoes. The paddle up River took about 10 minutes then we walked the river Delta for about 10 minutes to the nearest point to the Glacier. The views were amazing.... But the best part of the trip was the staff. They were simply the best I've ever experienced, they are fun and intelligent. You could tell that they loved their job and knew what they were doing.....I highly recommend this excursion."
9168,"Knowledgeable and happy to help.  A tremendous selection of products for all of your fermenting endeavors.  Also, generous contributors to the local homebrewing community."
9169,I had a delivery order that arrived shifted in the box and somewhat messy. They gave me a credit for slightly above what I paid and the manger was very polite about it all. Just the idea of them validating my frustration and then fixing the problem is worth being a return customer alone - much less their yummy food :D
9170,So much stuff
9171,"Very expensive compared to Enlighten, Fuzzy Monkey & AK Frost. If your on this side of town and can't travel stop in and get a preroll"
9172,"Good food, pizzas were fantastic like always!!!  Quick service and personable wait staff."
9173,Great service and epic food! FYI the homemade habanero hot sauce is legit AF but will also light you up!!!
9174,Wanna hang out with some great Alaskan's this is the place

9178,Great food. Definitely an Alaskan burger
9179,Probably the best Value Village in AK
9180,"Always great food, and friendly staff"
9181,"Clean and good service, fast food and I like McDonald's"
9182,Food is great but please get new bar staff. Barely acknowledged customers. Rude!
9183,"Perfect little tea shop with tea, coffee, bubble tea, and tons of honey and cute tea sets to choose from. I was the only customer in shop when I visited and I had the opportunity of getting to know the employee. She was so kind and informative on the types of tea, tea sets, and little tidbits bits of information pertaining to them.
She recommended I get the brown sugar bubble tea and boy oh boy was it good. Sweet, but not overly sweet. The boba pearls were also sweet and soft - I've been to a lot of tea shops that dont cook their boba long enough or the boba gets hard when it becomes cold, but Indigo Tea Lounges boba was perfect. I highly recommend stopping by if you're a tea or coffee lover. You wont be disappointed!"
9184,The homemade fries and bread are really good. The butterscotch milkshake is really good
9185,Always a great place for a steak or just drinks and appetizers after work. The signature pineapple martinis are phenomenal.
9186,Is good price I like watch there and parfume
9187,"Friendly feel, good local brew."
9188,Favorite place for coffee
9189,Omg the quiche. That is all.
9190,"Family Friendly attractions and Eagle eyed lifeguards may protect your kids from drowning, but they might still get tetanus..The whole place is a Fantasical rust bucket. Also many attractions haven't worked for years such as the enclosed body slide and the waves in the tidal pool. Your probably only going to want to come here for either the MASTER blaster the lazy river or the giant orange slide;this thing is extremely dangerous by the way. I once actually fell more than 40 feet  off of it while standing up inside it. Once again, fun location,needs safety and attraction repairs."
9191,"Excellent service!  We just stopped by for drinks this trip, but will definitely be back for more.  It all looks amazing."
9192,Not my first choice to go for steak dinner in Alaska. Service was great but the steak was over cooked and a little tough. Key lime pie is on point though.
9193,"Terrible costumer service. Every time we need to call, we sit on hold for well over an hour. Internet goes out at least once a month. If it wasn't for the fact that they are the only choice we have, I would switch"
9194,Great place to visit.
9195,"Awesome haircuts given here! Definitely the best in town, and best bang for your buck."
9196,Great food.
9197,The best potato patties and strudel in town by far.  Great service.
9198,Excellent customer service! Everyone is very knowledgeable and friendly
9199,Good environment and great staff. Wish wait time wasnt so long but that just means good business.

And the selection is vast and all tasty 😍 the treats case is well stocked and sooo pretty 🧁. Jackson and Em are always super nice when taking and making my order! (And the rest of the staff, I wish I could name them!) I wish I could give this cafe 10 stars because they deserve it! And the I think my favorite part is that my takeout order waste is compostable ☺️ the gluten free waffles never disappoint. The meze platter is filling, fresh and colorful! And the breakfast sandwhiches have the option to be made into a frittata; have you ever seen that? I haven't! I can't gush enough about this place 😍😍 I'm in love!! 💕💕"
9214,It helps with legal issues
9215,"For all the dog lovers out there this tour is a must!! I was so happy petting all the dogs and the sled ride was so much fun.
Be sure to wear clothes you don’t mind all the doggies jumping on tho! Lol cause they are friendly."
9216,"Great staff, fresh food."
9217,Great theater! I enjoy their comfortable reclining seats!
9218,Love this spot
9219,Great place to enjoy a good read.
9220,Nice little diner with friendly service and fun atmosphere.  Blueberry pancakes were really good.
9221,Friendly people who serve superb comfort food. A must place to eat in Fairbanks Alaska. We will be back.
9222,Everything you think a gift shop would having and more
9223,"not many stores in there, very small mall"
9224,Unsafe
9225,Nice place bit spendy
9226,Nice and quiet. Would recommend
9227,Though the Center is quite literally at the end of the road it is worth the drive to see  the sweeping views of Eagle River Valley. Trails are well maintained and a wide variety of Ed classes are always offered.
9228,Their service was the best in town
9229,Long time player in equipping the music industry...
9230,"Cashier was rude and challenging when we asked to see the ticket split before we paid, claimed she could not do it before we paid and proceeded to be rude in front of the manager who had no problem doing what we asked"
9231,Great burgers! 😊
9232,First time riding in a Limo and was Truly Incredible. The Limo Driver was amazing and made me feel like a Rockstar. I will now and forever always suggest BAC Transportation for any and all of my Limo adventures.
9233,One of the best kept secrets in Anchorage.  Great food and service.  Any of the burgers are great and they make the best halibut sandwich in town. For first time try the halibut sandwich or beer battered halibut and chips.
9234,Great people. They really make you feel welcome. No matter your back ground or anything. Dont worry about what to say or wear. Just show up.
9235,Cute little store
9236,"Not a fan of the new ordering system, and that the bar is essentially pointless now. The grilled cheese was still great, but the bloody mary was weak and not flavorful. This used to be my wife and I's favorite spot for brunch, but we probably wont be back. The atmosphere is not nearly as friendly now. Sad to see. When there's a real bartender again and not just people wandering around looking for numbers let me know. Cheers

Edit:
Hahahaha that was my bad. I've been here like 10 times but never during the week. I stand corrected on the weekday service thing, I was oblivious. I'm upping it to 4 stars, but the bloody mary was still weak lol. We'll be back on the weekend!"
9237,"Good burgers, the Chinese food isn’t the best."
9238,Fast food
9239,Garden Bar is awesome! Lots of fresh salad ingredients for $12! Great spot for downtown locals and workers to grab a quick bite for lunch between 10am-2pm.. I'll be making this a regular stop for food. Thanks Williwaw!
9240,Rooms were clean and comfortable
9241,easy access personal servie
9242,I've been working here for 6 months I love it my boss and everyone has been awesome

9247,Had the spa repair parts I needed.
9248,Great job Dave...
9249,Great shop
9250,Delicious and very glad we made this choice to grab something quick for dinner. Portions we're heart and big for the price. We will be definitely visiting again!
9251,"If your looking for flare it's not here, pretty much basic. Help was wonderful but it was Sunday and really busy, have been there twice and first time fool was great.So to be fair I'd try again."
9252,"Best Mexican food in Anchorage, lovely staff"
9253,Great chicken salads! Our server was fantastic.
9254,Pretty
9255,Only downside is the lack of elevator
9256,Great food and drinks. Super awesome service
9257,Friendly and fast!
9258,It was decent  enough
9259,"they have fresh Asian veggies that other stores don't carry. But horrible return policies, and sometimes have expired food. They Take advantage over COVID-19 and not accepting any product return even if product is damaged or expired."
9260,"Great service, good price, and nice atmosphere."
9261,They keep a nice watch on the dogs and have an excellent facility. Staff is friendly and responsible. Our dog loves her day-care days
9262,Good food and ambiance!

9264,Suuuuper yummy! Make sure to go hungry!
9265,Bonnie mcmury
9266,"Awesome place
Well informed staff
Charlotte's Web X SourDiesel!"
9267,"G & P takes care of their humidor and is knowledgeable about the cigars and pipe tobacco they carry.  You can always find a diamond in the rough in there lower shelves for cigars.  Sure they have the Macunodos, Arturo's, and Partagas.  Dont be afraid to try something new."
9268,"Excellent food, good friendly service, decent prices, food arrives at table quickly. Mongolian beef was great!
Edit: I just had to come back here. The food is incredible."
9269,"These guys are the best at what they do. They are very friendly and knowledgeable. Plus, they give back to their community."
9270,Never been in there before but I'm sure it's great
9271,Beautiful
9272,Not going to get much better for a grocery store
9273,"I have NEVER felt more unwelcome anywhere. Our waiter asked me at least 4 times in the first 5 minutes we were there if I was ready to order yet then disappearedafter our food got here, my son had an adult menu and order a burger with fries and a milkshake and he got a small kids meal, and I asked for a to go vox from another server and I got oh I can't do that and walked off (he didn't even let my server know), then it took about 15 minutes to get our servers attention, my son just asked to wait in the car it took so long. It was his Birthday which is why he chose to go there and I had a $50 bill to give our server to bribe him for a good birthday song but when he said he just wanted to go home I felt so bad and almost just walked out. I will not be going back there."
9274,"You pay $30 a head if you want to get to the parking lot overlooking the glacier. You drive yourself thru the gate and along the bumpy gravel road over single lane wood plank bridges for 2 miles to reach the glacier parking lot. The hike up to the ice is your choice but the fee is the same. It's a mile up and back for the self-guided walking tour. Watch your step because you signed away all of your legal rights to sue them if you trip! It's all on you. I think they should install a narrow gague rail line from the visitor's shop to the glacier lot. That would reduce wear & tear on vehicles and on the road and it would be fun and worth more. Its a steep road at points, tho.

Bring a jacket. Its cold by the ice even on a warm day like ours was."
9275,"Food is good and its a nice place but like any ""good"" place in anchorage its going to be busy. Waiting is common"
9276,"Fantastic serivce,  delicious food and very nice chill vibe!"
9277,Gal was great and found what I needed.
9278,Too much goose poop
9279,Cool people.
9280,Chan was very helpful. Very knowledgeable in his work.
9281,Not friendly treat you like an outsider will not take cash or debit an you have to have a return ticket back home before they will rent an credit  card only
9282,"Half the time the order is not ready in a reasonable amount of time. Now the cost of items on the dollar menu have gone up meaning my usually cheap lunch is now the cost of a full meal at Wendy's. So I guess I'll go hungry today and that's the last time I swing by a McDonalds. If y'all are having such a problem with money, stop hiring entitled kids who refuse to move on to greener pastures. There is no shortage of kids willing to take a cheap minimum wage."
9283,Very quiet place to remember the fallen. Also a great camping grounds
9284,trendy and cool
9285,"The two young men working were amazing! Great service, great sandwiches and great environment!"
9286,Please stop showing that commercial where the old guy dances and the prices are not competitive. Not good place.
9287,Great variety.  Great prices.
9288,"Love their breakfast, the sausage cooked all the way, hash brown just the right amount, eggs over easy, and the French toast was great. Love this place"
9289,enjoyed the atmosphere and no rowdies and place reqlly cleamed up well
9290,"Gorgeous views and fascinating estuary eco systems, beaver habitat, water fowl and salmon runs make this corner of the wetlands a worthwhile visit."
9291,When i first moved to anchorage my husband and I love this place. But these past couple years we haven't gone there often because every time we have tried there is always something that came up. Like the ground beef that I had with my tacos got me sick one visit. Another time I was drinking my fountain drink and found food that was stuck to my cup. We don't go their anymore
9292,"taco bell can do better. I ordered tacos rancheros ""steak rancheros"" it came as like stew meat boiled in tomato sauce. Their pork carnitas are like greasy chicken chunks on tortillas. I still tipped cause the waitresses are super nice."
9293,Neat place
9294,Great place to watch the sun set!!
9295,Great service and food! Waitress wasn't that friendly but she was fast!
9296,Not enough employees to move customers along.
9297,Sooooo fun there
9298,Not bad drive threw only no condiments in bag for fries but also didnt ask. Good food. Over all not bad
9299,"My wife and I went here for the first time, upon entry we noticed it was a very clean and welcoming establishment. The waitresses were very nice, making small talk and smiling as they were prompt with refills and clearing the table. The food was delicious with great serving sizes and the coffee was so good we had to ask what brand it was. For the two of us it was just over $40. We enjoyed the Christian music playing over the speakers and found out the owners are believers in Christ Jesus. We can't wait to come back and bring our whole family."
9300,It ok
9301,"I went in, I told him what I wanted, he did just as I asked. Amazing friendly guy and very talented. Constantly asked me for feedback and I gave it to him. When in doubt - trust his judgment."
9302,Nothing really there i wouldn't call it a mall but really go restaurant's
9303,"A bit spendy for breakfast compared to other places around town. Tasty, large servings, pleasant staff."
9304,"We were half an hour early for our reservation so we decided to get drinks out in the garden. I got a Kambucha cocktail and my husband ordered a “the radler”. Nice we got inside I ordered the Peanut Pan with tofu, my husband ordered a BiBimBop with pork. Both really good!"
9305,"I suggest taking the train down the pass, as compared to going up. It was a fun trip. The. staff are very nice, helpful when needed. Now owned by RCCL."
9306,More Intune with Alaska style.
9307,"By far the best Sushi place I've been to. Mmm, good."
9308,We love the theater and the shows promoted for kids.
9309,You should try local street foods...
9310,Best BLTs ever. Cute and cozy restaurant with true Alaska dishes and quick bites too.
9311,Awesome selection of dry and sweet ciders. Servers are friendly and the atmosphere is upbeat great place to meet nice customers.
9312,"Always busy, sloppy food prep"
9313,"This trailer park is ok, but could use a lot of improvement."
9314,Great food. Entertainment was great. Clean facility. Friendly staff.
9315,As much as I love going to JOANN'S I don't dare go there often for if I do the bills won't be paid. 😂
9316,"Smelled sooo good, very friendly and well stocked"
9317,Says they are open on Sundays and they were not open. Sucks cause I walked in the rain. I get that its Memorial weekend but Memorial day isn't until tomorrow.
9318,Loved it
9319,Nice cafe with a good atmosphere
9320,Not very many people & quiet
9321,"Fun place, good food!"
9322,"Worst customer service!  Came in 20 minutes before closing and told the employee we would like to eat in since we normally don’t take long anyway, the front counter girl looked so upset and raised her eyebrows  not to mention the girl in the back making the sandwiches. She wanted to make it clear they closed in 15 min then  She grunted so loud I heard it loud and clear. I Told the girl up front to make it to go since it was an obviously inconvenience for the staff here. This upset me so bad I sit here writing a review while waiting for my food! Rude staff"
9323,Good food
9324,Clean and easy to use the equipment. It has tv for you to watch any shows while you are training.
9325,best in town
9326,"Great quality, great prices, great with kids, great all around ♡"
9327,I went into Lithia in South Anchorage early Friday morning for just an oil change. I came out with my dream car! David Dowd was super friendly and very helpful and got me a good deal and a Wrangler. He worked very hard on getting me to my price point so that I could purchase this vehicle and still be comfortable. I truly had a great experience purchasing my Jeep here!
9328,No way to know when theyre open or close...
9329,"Small place, but fascinating!"
9330,Antogonizing
9331,Fun toys for big boys
9332,They have the parts that I need
9333,Good service. Got my new tires here
9334,"It's Walmart. Enough said. However, this one seems to have a nicer selection of produce."
9335,"I don't have anything to say about this place. This was my first visit to a Smashburger. I ordered the Alaska Kenai burger with smash fries. The fries were tasty and not over seasoned, while the burger was hot and delicious. There was fresh jalapeno on it as well as a generous helping of cooked to perfection onion stack. The egg bun is a nice touch. Service was quick and friendly and the place was very clean. I will be back!"
9336,I love this park. 😍
9337,nice place to start our snowmachine trip
9338,I love you guys for being 24 hours. Don't ever close!
9339,Great overpriced food. Costs less to eat at golden corral
9340,This zoo is very small and charges you to enter.
9341,"Good coffee, neat place to hang out."
9342,They had the biggest crab legs I'd ever had. Heard about it while at home. Heard about the crab on the train. Did not disappoint
9343,Very polite with a lot of selection. Just were out of stock on what I came in for.
9344,Love to get the Spicy Italian Toasted Footlong
9345,"Good and only place to bowl in the city. Floor or shoes were very slick, almost fell everytime. Slow food cooking but very tasty burgers! Very bad music in jukebox.
It was OK!"
9346,"We have been very happy with our stay both times. Quiet, inexpensive and everything wee needed."
9347,Had takeout but dinning in looked very good.
9348,"Great burgers. Usually pretty noisy, all around a good restaurant."
9349,great place to enjoy with family
9350,"My husband and I have been going taco king for 3yrs.we have never had a bad meal, the guys that work there are wonderful,  they have great customer service.😊  my thanks to them."
9351,Good coffee
9352,Very informative tour and cool sights of the glaciers

9354,They have the meats.
9355,Going out from business
9356,Good food. At bit noisy. Great mixologist
9357,"(Translated by Google) For those of us who are strangers, it is interesting

(Original)
Para los que somos forasteros es interesante"
9358,Thought it was very good.
9359,This gym has everything I need. I like the layout of where everything is. The staff are all friendly and helpful. And the regulars are nice as well! Clean facility and enjoyable atmosphere. And you cannot beat the membership price!
9360,"Our dog died suddenly a little over a week ago. He was part of our family for several years. Both my husband and I couldn't even look at other dogs without crying.  A few days ago he went to the shelter to look at a bird cage, and while he was there he was looking at all the dogs. He found our Kira in a cage at the back of the room, curled into a ball, looking very miserable. They both made eye contact,  and Kira was the only dog in the whole shelter that not only didn't make him cry, but also made him smile. We can never replace Marlon, but Kira has filled a whole in our heart and our family. Thank you so much, it means the world to us.💖😍"
9361,It was a beautiful and nice hike. The views at the top were amazing!
9362,"A newer Bass Pro. Good parking, wide selection."
9363,"Helpful, friendly staff. Great selection of comics and gaming supplies of all kind."
9364,Loved the food but always seems packed
9365,Best modern Japanese food on the East side
9366,The viewing deck is a sweet view of Twin Peaks!
9367,"HOCKEY IS ALWAYS FUN!! ICE DOGS WON, WOOHOO!"
9368,Good food fast. So many options but not an overwhelming menu. Great music and atmosphere.
9369,It was a creative looking little park. Would definitely take kids there if I had any.
9370,Perfect little rest stop. Great stop for the view and a few pictures! Awesome view of the Spit as well
9371,Decent food and service. Good drinks
9372,"I love shopping at carrs because I collect my skymiles, and everything I need is there. Oh and close to home 😊"
9373,Beautiful
9374,"(Translated by Google) overpowering!

(Original)
מהמם!"
9375,"Loved it, but it's gone"
9376,Ice fishing this evening and didn't catch anything! Better luck next time!
9377,This is possibly the best pizza in Fairbanks. The dough is perfect. Made in a wood burning pizza oven which gives the crust that perfect crunch. The toppings are varied and fresh. Let me also say that it’s not fair to go to a place called house of fire pizza and review them poorly because wood fired pizza isn’t what you like. If you want to go to Pizza Hut then go there. But this establishment provides a more authentic pizza experience that can be tailored to your liking! Bravo!
9378,Great place to shop
9379,Produce and meat are tragic.
9380,Always fast and very helpful.
9381,Great lunch. Local seniors crowd.
9382,"Always loved this place, good food and GREAT service!"
9383,Fair prices regarding its a souvenir shop
9384,"Great service, great beer, great food and of course, the Magic Bus!"
9385,It was tasty food but definitely not worth the price. The portions are big and the staff are friendly. The place is small and quaint. Try to make a reservation if you can because they get busy fast. The egg rolls are subpar.
9386,Its football time
9387,Helpful but took along time
9388,"Wonderful nature center!  Well kept grounds, good walking trails for the most part, pleasant staff, nice main building, great public outreach programs.  Some of the trails are rough and may just be works in progress, so be careful not to stumble or twist an ankle.  RECOMMEND!"
9389,"Cheap, delicious Thai food!"
9390,"Talk about Great Value for the money.

Chicken that actually tastes and looks like Chicken;  imagine that!

Staff are fast, efficient and unlike, dare I say every other fast food restaurant, they've never screwed up an order.

If you qualify don't forget to ask for your Senior Discount."
9391,Nice. Clean
9392,"Feels like new. Good furnishings, nice kitchen corner, large bathroom & tub/shower. Good view considering the location in town."
9393,Awesome 👍 👍😊
9394,Awesome staff and great food! Would highly suggest.
9395,"Large fields and a decent hill for sledding accompany a park with a gazebo and tables to create the perfect atmosphere for a picnic, flying kites, or staring at your phone ignoring everyone around you."
9396,Pizza
9397,Freaking scary. But our bus driver had mad driving skills. Beautiful vistas.
9398,The guinea pig product is extremely disorganized. It's in 3 different aisles. There was only 1 cashier and 6 people in line.
9399,"My dog hates his nails clipped, and makes it almost impossible at home. He actually likes coming to this place. Less than 5 minutes and he's good to go. Super well priced."
9400,"As for a visitor center, this is a dumb location!!! If you end up here with an RV rig, the streets are congested and there is nowhere to park."
9401,Best brisket in anchorage!!!
9402,Average and buy one take one home has hidden fees and bread is extra
9403,Great family run business Gary and Tony and Bonnie are the greatest thanks for the great experience
9404,Service is not what it used to be☹️
9405,The staff are always extremely friendly and helpful whenever I stop in. I have a kiddo allergic to soy and I love that I can get her Naked bread 3/$5 instead of grocery store prices.
9406,Pretty nice for a Walmart
9407,Always easy time get in and out
9408,Great service
9409,The food and service was great. Very quick service. Visit again someday
9410,Great place to get a quick bite to go. Their breakfast burrito are awesome 👌
9411,Good icecream
9412,My favorite park is usually the park I'm visiting. But for some reason I keep visiting Denali. The visitor center is the most approachable way to see the wonders of the place. It's a welcome resting and watering spot for hikers as well.
9413,Great atmosphere and good food
9414,I was able to order something online right in store and pick up was fast and easy. It only took a week and the product was awesome!!
9415,"Enjoyed it. Some dishes a bit spicy, but not in a bad way."
9416,One of the better stores in town
9417,Good causal food
9418,Bathroom is nasty.  Visitors are going into the bushes and trails instead.
9419,Service was fast. In love the vanilla latt'e. Some places don't get it quite right. But Starbucks knows how to do I t right.
9420,Super great place
9421,Beautiful view!!
9422,"They're so kind and always remember who we are. Great quality, great prices"
9423,"Moose's tooth, as always, was great.  45 minute wait which is normal.  Even though the computer systems went down, everything was great and not too long at all.  They even messed up our pizza and gave us a free small one.  Phenomenal place to eat and hang out!!!"
9424,"Always super friendly, even on the busy days. If you are looking for a good place to unwind I would definitely stop in for the BBQ and the western burger."
9425,Great coffee
9426,Loads of fun
9427,Love the arcade game at the front
9428,My wife  loves to  shop there
9429,The restaurant had became a victim of the fire and was burnt down on Feb 7 of 2019.
9430,"Great place. You fly in on float planes over the several on Juneau's glaciers, including the massive Taku glacier. You land on the Taku River. And Taxi to the dock. The flight in alone was worth the ticket. You spend a couple of hours at the lodge. We were there when the weather had been unseasonably hot which presented two issues 1) the heat created several fires in Alaska which covered much of the state in smoke including Juneau,  and 2) the amount of mosquitos on the trail was quite large.  Even with these, the trip was worth it so don't let a little fog deter going.

At the lodge you are treated to a wonderful salmon meal. The grill/smoke it right there when you arrive."
9431,Too many pushy people.
9432,"They have the specialized, pro-level gear for a reasonable price, and the service is the best in town. If you have something specific in mind, this place is an excellent choice."
9433,Great selection of donuts. Too bad there's only one in Anchorage
9434,great waitress ok food
9435,"The food,service,and staff are awesome!"
9436,You get a head wash and a massage with it.
9437,Service on a Saturday was very slow. My burger was ordered pink and came dry and over cooked. The waiter was kind and only slightly forgetful. Prices were considerably higher than the lower states but that's to be expected.
9438,Best Subway in Kodiak. I only went there twice before the employees knew what I wanted before I ordered
9439,Yum
9440,Great food and beer. I've always been amazed by everything I've ordered (with the exception of a reindeer sausage pizza that was recommended by the waiter.) Huge outdoor patio that's fun when the weather is nice.
9441,My kids love this food
9442,Love the remodel.  Food was good.
9443,Pretty good curly fries and chicken sandwiches. I also enjoyed strawberry shake!!!
9444,"Had a lot if fun. It was my 1st time going. Few things they need to inform pple on when they come in and are buying beer and bowling. Like not being allowed to take ur drink to ur lane! And that it needs to be carried by an employee! They didn't tell me and I got ""chased"". Ended up waiting awhile for a lane, but once we started bowling it was great."
9445,"This place is always a favorite little get away for me. I love the music, the staff, and the wonderful people who live there!"
9446,A real delight and I learned so much about Alaska.
9447,Taco night is good...
9448,"Good place to stay, at the post time the outside was being updated. The room flooring needs a upgraded. All the staff were great!"
9449,Pretty good
9450,Great work and great people they did an excellent job at a fair price.
9451,"American style food with a focus on pies and breakfast. This restaurant is a Denny's type place, food is nothing to mind blowing and the service is hit or miss"
9452,Crowded and claustrophobic feeling space.
9453,Over 10 visits always awesome. They're very fast with long drive thru line's
9454,Food was really good.
9455,Great facility
9456,"Very nice place, good food and friendly lady"
9457,I took my 9yo in just to look and everyone was so great about answering his 9million questions. He left with some stickers and a VERY big Christmas list. Thanks guys! :-)
9458,Worked with Albert he was very patient and honest with me.  Had a great experience.  Would totally recommend and come back when I decide to upgrade my vehicle again.  I did not think I would be able to buy a truck and he found reasonable options for me to explore.  Left with a reasonable rate and I am a very happy girl.
9459,"Nice people, good food, fairly quick, convenient location"
9460,Such yummy coffee- vanilla big train chai!! Great prices and friendly faces:)!
9461,Nice place

9465,Has all you need or can get it.
9466,"Good and secure, storage rooms are clean, staff is friendly"
9467,"Really cool, this guy is doing business in something he loves. I know from personal experience that this is a road less traveled and therefore more challenging. I wish Bret the best of business and hope he keeps me in mind in case he needs help in his print shop. Thank you for speaking with me Bret.

Robert,
An admiring screen printer"
9468,They get you in and out witha tire change or a oil change fast.
9469,Love the customer service. No wait.
9470,Big spacious fairly priced
9471,Nice place.  well kept and good for kids to come and learn about animals. Wish the coffee shop hours matched zoo hours
9472,Petco & a Sporting Goods Store near by.
9473,"Great place if you want real food, from real people who aren't trying to do fake diner upscale stuff... Just real diner food that you like, then this is the place to go.  Probably my favorite everyday place to go to eat."
9474,Okay for temporary stay

9500,Real Native History
9501,"Classic Alaska burger joint. Some of the best burgers in town, IMHO. Good food and great prices in an amazing atmosphere. The outside seating along Campbell Creek is a delight when the weather cooperates. I like their ""onion pieces,"" not so much the onion rings though. Really good shakes too."
9502,Love their food!! Great service!

There's always great music, a lot of smiles, and an uplifting and friendly atmosphere. It really brightens my day going here, I'm so thankful for the memories I have had here. Great place for time to relax alone or with friends/family!"
9515,"They were fairly busy so it took  a while to get help, but once they got to me I was helped quickly. They ordered my parts which came in faster than expected. Downsides, transactions can take a while so there may be a bit of a wait and their loaner tool box appears to be fairly depleted. Upsides, good people, knowledgeable staff, helpful and efficient when they get to you."
9516,Great prices on gifts & Fudge.
9517,Very beautiful 💙
9518,Love their appetizers!
9519,"Good shopping complex - Best Buy, Target, Regal 16, many more.  A little too spaced out and hard to walk from one place to another but sometimes necessary due to parking."

9522,Great service and wonderful people.
9523,Knowledgable people that don't try to sell you stuff you don't need and help guide you to what you do. Well stocked selection and a great place to support local business.
9524,Very good place to have a bite. The waiter was kind and on the ball. Did  not have to ask for a glass to be filled or nothing. Best place I have eaten at in Anchorage so far been here for a year and a half. As far as food and atmosphere go here and bring friends it is the best.

Staff was great, we were there almost at 8pm and they were closing but we had a great service with friendly server.
I recommend this restaurant with 5 stars."
9531,Awesome fast-food restaurant! Love their chicken sandwiches!
9532,Typical of airport fast food
9533,This location tends to have the shelves stocked better than others.
9534,It's McDonald's you know what your getting food wise. However the staff at this location is always friendly they work hard to keep it clean at all times. The mangers aren't afraid to jump in if the need to to keep everything running smoothly.
9535,Always good. Busy.

9543,Good facility. Had everything I need for a workout.
9544,Great hike to see Seward and the surrounding mountains.
9545,Customer service very helpful
9546,The associate that helped me may have changed my dog's life! He was suffering from recurring ear infections and I never knew there were OTC solutions that could help prevent them. She helped me pick one out and he's been SO much happier and in less pain since then. I'm incredibly grateful.
9547,I love going here for quality coffee or a unique waffle
9548,Chax exceeded my expectations!  A+ work!
9549,The chicken parmesan was so good... moist

9552,I love it here!!! It's so fun and great food!
9553,the food is always amazing!! The ladies who run it are always very pleasant and friendly!! Best burger in town.
9554,"Very good!  On the multiple repeat list.  Creative items as well as classics.  A Homer must.  Service can be slow, but absolutely worth the wait in the good atmosphere.  A terrific place to enjoy with friends."
9555,"Our family was finally able to drive up from Delta on the last day to visit the park.  Enjoyed the sculptures, some melting had occurred but did not diminish the artwork.  The kids like the slides.  I'm not sure their was an international element to the artwork this year, being a COVID year, however, the park was a success in my estimation."
9556,Average burger joint
9557,Quick and fast and I love the tots
9558,Natural Pantry for vitamins
9559,Poor selection of Purina pro plan food. Always out of stock. Very high prices compared to other local stores. Poor customer service!
9560,Clean and stocked. The only place to get yucca in the valley.
9561,Exelect service nice people
9562,Breathtaking
9563,A good selection of products that are reasonably priced and close to home in the North Pole Mall.
9564,"This little hole in the wall has a wonderful selection of sushi, Chinese, and Korean food. All of their menu items are custom made fresh when you order them. Appetizers, lunch, and dinner options will not disappoint. Beef bulgogi, chicken katsu, and veggie rolls are my personal favorites. Hubby and kids go tos are: Spicy Tuna Roll, Mt. McKinley Roll, and Samurai Roll."
9565,Great as all of them are.
9566,Great deals and helpful sales people
9567,Great food and allergy friendly
9568,Great place for a birthday party the staff is great. Prices are ok and the pizza is good. My little loved it and I can not complain as I grew up going to cec. However cec has competition now and it seems they have started to step up their game to stay relevant
9569,"Normal Juneau over pricing but the food was really good, the coffee was good, the service was great and I would have given 5 stars if the women didnt start slamming her broom around our table and moving chairs out next to us while we were trying to enjoy breakfast. Pictures is ""Killer French Toast"" and ""Loco Moco"" we had a large order of amazingly seasoned tater tots and portions were generous. I hope they bring their Ramen back soon!"
9570,Great place. The pub food is excellent
9571,Such an amazing view
9572,Decent hotel and room. Very basic. Excellent location. Close to everything. However the room we were in had no views but was clean. Has a restaurant which served good breakfast as well. Free shuttle service dropped us off and picked us up from the Rail depot.
9573,It so beautiful
9574,Enjoyed a peaceful yoga flow in the presence of Reindeer.
9575,Awesome train trip from sea level to White Pass on this historic railroad. A must for all at delightful Skagway.
9576,Nice place
9577,"Great menu, great place for all day breakfast. Peaceful friendly relaxed"
9578,"(Translated by Google) It is still a great place to visit at Fairbanks, which you will not see much of.

(Original)
별로 볼 것이 없는 페어뱅크스에서 그래도 볼만한 곳입니다."
9579,Nice rooms with great views. Clean and comfortable space!
9580,"Paid $16 for a car wash (their top of the line) that didn't even get my car clean. Wand washes are still the way to go if you want quality.
Edit - the manager contacted me and had me come through again (on them) and had me go through the bay with the attendant. That baby is the one to use. It's worth the extra few bucks to get your car super clean."
9581,They usually get your order wrong and the food is lukewarm.
9582,Some new safeguards in place. No more serve yourself spicy hot peppers and pickles. They have some prepackaged in cups but they have a smaller selection. But their burgers are still excellent.
9583,Great food will vome back as always soup was very hot great on these cold winter night
9584,Lovely place. Very welcoming ♡ Excellent staff☆ I won't go anywhere else.
9585,So many toys to look through if you have the time.
9586,Looks like a nice place. We only stayed for lunch as provided by HAL on our way from Denali to Seward. WORST food I ever had...
9587,Currently closed for construction.
9588,Great staff and work very reasonable
9589,Love the pizza here
9590,Staff was the best.  Gave great recommendations for my first time there.
9591,"Best chicken fried steak in town.   Also had a biscuit instead of toast.  It was huge and very tasty! Will be going back to try the biscuits and gravy.   The service was also very good.  For the money it has probably the best bet in town.   They do need new booths.  Otherwise, no complaints.

I went back on the day of my wedding with about ten other guys.   The wait staff was excellent and very fast.   Food came out quickly and as always was excellent.   They even accommodated some special request."
9592,Oldest coffee roaster in town. Well deserved reputation for excellent coffee and service. This espresso well worth the effort. Covid safe with curbside and in store service. Enjoy =)
9593,It is ok.
9594,"They post vehicles on Craigslist pretending they are private seller and confessed that it was their selling strategy(?).
Purchased vehicle condition was fair but poor detailing and they didn't provide a spare tire (Which is illegal to sell vehicle without it).
Make sure you check & get everything straightened out before you sign on your paper work. Owner will change his attitude once you sign."
9595,"Service is usually good. Burgers are usually excellent. I say usually, because sometimes they are understaffed and both food and drink suffer. I used to come in all the time for burgers but anymore there are more consistent choices nearby. I hope they fix the problem because a good burger in a dive bar is worth traveling for."
9596,Great place to spend time with family & friends
9597,Top of the world came up for work interesting to see
9598,Beautiful place with beautiful grounds. Large pool and sauna.  Trolley lift up the mountain is a little costly but they throw in a free drink at the bar.
9599,"$8.00 for a tiny cup of flavorless soup and $17.00 on a breakfast sandwich the size of an egg McMuffin.   The prices were too high and the quantity was too small.  There were no napkins on the table, the server acted like we had Leprosy even though we had masks on, our water was never refilled and we were never checked on by the server after she took our orders. I will not be returning."
9600,"Love this place, they always do a good Job and are super creative, fast and friendly"
9601,The French fries were great! Good burger too.
9602,Excellent food and excellent service. A perfect date!
9603,"I ordered Frito Pie with Brisket and although I started to eat it pretty quickly it was really cold. I took it back for a replacement and they insisted I receive a refund and a fresh order. The replacement was generous and delicious.

My friend ordered a BBQ plate with ribs and I wish I would have ordered that too because the ribs were AMAZING. I would definitely eat here again."
9604,One of the best Chinese food in Alaska.
9605,Great historic center along with great information.
9606,"Carry Alaskan Fish oil for dogs and cats. I make my own cat food, nice to see an Alaskan product for alaskan pets.  I didn't notice if any of the three Alaska Fish Oils were alaskan owned. 2 are labeled with 'wild & sustainably sourced'."
9607,Clean place with good washers and dryers.  They keep the showers clean too. Nice hot water with good pressure.
9608,The ice cream wad very tasty and the service was great!!!
9609,I mean what's not to love
9610,Good food and coffee
9611,Good food and drink friendly staff.
9612,"Fast and super friendly staff, great food! Will definitely come back for more."
9613,House balls are a bit overly chipped. Prices are above norm but overall that's to be expected due to this facility being the only alley in the valley.
9614,"Good food, decent service, found 3 HAIRS in my food though."
9615,Go there.
9616,"Great customer service,  Mike helped me get into the truck I wanted and helped me get a great Interest rate and low monthly payment.  Thank you."
9617,Overwhelming!

9620,Amazing gluten-free food!
9621,Nice 👌 views from everyone
9622,"Nice store, good inventory, walked around store and looked at everything I was interested in. No one offered to help me so I left."
9623,Cashier was very friendly and helpful. Prices are not too bad and plenty of registers open
9624,Excellent location for a walk in the park. And close to downtown anchorage for easy to access activities.
9625,"Best pizza ever, stone oven and they have local beers. Ordered the margarita pizza and the pear one...forgot what it was called, perfectly thinly sliced tomatoes and pears didnt make the pizza soggy like a lot of places normally do, delicous and a beautiful view"
9626,One of thee best in town
9627,I only dropped a person off at the Hotel. They commented on how nice the rooms and service were.
9628,Best restaurant in all of Alaska by far.
9629,One of my go-to places to pickup gear for my dogs.  Nice staff.
9630,"Just make sure you are VERY clear what you'll be billed for.  I expected to pay $58 and I was billed $72.50.  It's $58/hr PER man.  I had two guys here for 1.25 hrs and it was $72.50.  Just ask them to be very clear what you'll be billed for.  They DID do a nice job on our yard though, so I do appreciate that."
9631,Poor selection of laptop accessories
9632,Great views good food
9633,Quality time with my best friend!
9634,Some employees were either wearing their mask on one ear or with the nose out. 15 minute wait in the drive thru with 2 cars ahead if me. The food was hot though. Reported this info on the online survey too.
9635,"Clean theater, a bit overpriced"
9636,Delivery is awesome.
9637,"Love, Love, Love this place! I went every day or two and had an awesome tan. Everyone there was super nice to me and made my whole ""relaxation"" time even better!"
9638,Must stop on the way to Talkeetna. Great beer and fun tour
9639,Salted cream cold foam cold brew it the bomb
9640,THE BEST!!! Oh my god the food here is amazing. Staff is friendly and fast.
9641,"When you walk in nobody greets you. I didnt  have a room but i was able to walk into the establishment and go straight to the pool and after i knocked loudly,  a guest opened the door and allowed me in. There were only 2 very young girls in pool (1 being mine)  this made me VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. ANYBODY  could of  gotten in there. Kids were 8 n 10.
Need to b more aware of the people coming in n out."
9642,Great
9643,My self as well as my family didn't care for the food.
9644,Great little cinema with a good range of snacks
9645,"Love the place, the food, and the ambiance. There is a selection of board games to play while enjoying your yogurt and the artwork on display changes every month. A few vegan options are available with a great selection of toppings to choose from. I recomend NYS to all my friends!"
9646,Great coffee and really cool atmosphere.
9647,The burgers were ok. The fries were good. The price wasn't bad. I probably won't return and would rather try other places than try again.
9648,The store was clean just not a wide selection
9649,"We visited for dinner , and though it says that the place closes at midnight, we'd recommend reaching before 10.30 as they close down the kitchen soon after. Out of the orders, the special that day was the best - a shrimp ravioli with peppers that was done very well. The lasagna was good, but the carbonara and the pizza weren't very good. The carbonara felt like an alfredo sauce pasta and the pizza was too thick (maybe we're too used to NY style pizza). Service was decent though although we felt the place was slightly pricey for what they offered"
9650,"Always a fun stop in Homer.  Make sure to watch a movie, hike the trail, see Bishops Beach, then hit up Two Sisters bakery.  Great way to spend a couple of hours."
9651,Great food. Beautiful little spot
9652,Great food and amazing shakes
9653,The food was delicious the service awesome. There was just a bit of a mix up when it came to paying the check.
9654,Awesome boneless wings!! Every time
9655,Good
9656,Drive thru coffee
9657,"Travis was an awesome waiter, food was delicious. Got a New York sour by asking, omg that drink needs to come back. Above and beyond service!"
9658,"You'd think being part of a big chain this place wouldn't be that great, but I've had nothing short of amazing service here. They have good employees working here that are helpful and friendly. I've had them go above and beyond for me on multiple occasions."
9659,Rick and all the workers are wonderful! I needed to get the cars winterized while my husband was away. I was nervous but he explained nicely and got them done perfectly for a really good price. The second visit was to get our tires changed. He helped us to change them patiently. Thank you so much!
9660,"Food is good, but service is sometimes lacking. Overall, a good dining experience."
9661,Curry and seaweed
9662,Took a bit to get seated and once we ordered it felt like forever but the food was worth the wait.
9663,Great Pho!
9664,"The two-hour snowmobile tour was SPECTACULAR! Beautiful scenery and four moose. We also had a great time ice fishing. Rod, Jr and Aaron were outstanding guides and hosts! 12th trip to Alaska. Rod's is HIGHLY recommended!"
9665,Only pre packed flower.
9666,"This place is always a favorite little get away for me. I love the music, the staff, and the wonderful people who live there!"
9667,It's Bullwinkle's. Not a bad alternative to dominos but don't expect much more.
9668,My kids LOVE THIS PLAYGROUND!
9669,The sales associates in the store were very helpful.

9677,Best place for human food and animal feed.
9678,The prices are reasonable and the location.
9679,"My first time experience was super from the second I made the phone call to me carrying my yummy pizza out to my truck. I ordered the Saverio's special with no cheese. First time eating anchovies on a pizza, the store placed the anchovies on the side in a small container and allowed the customer decide how much if any to place on top. They are like a fishy pimento olive. The staff was super great and the order was correct and delicious. Plenty of space to eat inside and parking is no problem. I consider the price extremely fair for what you get. Can't wait to try other items on my next visit. They do some delivery so call them up and find out what the schedule is. They open at 11am so a customer can get in before the lunchtime rush if needed. I called my order in at 11 and it was done by 11:20, I was in and out.
Thinks guys, see you next time around."
9680,Great prices and great staff

9687,"Again, Thai is the best."
9688,Good pizza good service
9689,It is the best place to stay the prices are outrageously cheap for Alaskan residents they're clean they have the most great food in their restaurant only serves dinner so you know but they do have kitchenettes in every room but microwave coffee pot and refrigerator no no dishes are utensils supplied I must stay if you go to Anchorage and even if you don't live in Alaska they have other discounts! 💜

9704,It's Walmart
9705,"My windshield took a beating this past winter (Oct 2019-April 2020) which lead to chips & cracks. I called around for quotes and saw that they were the cheapest at about $580 (including military discount). Safelite AutoGlass was ridiculously expensive, quoting me at a little over a grand. The gal that had answered the phone was friendly and informative. I ended up canceling my appt because I felt it wasn’t worth dropping half a grand for a new windshield only for it to get new chips & cracks this coming winter and so on. If it interferes with my line of sight then I’ll for sure reach out for an appt."
9706,"The food was pretty good, however they didn't have enough seats to fit our party, so we had to split up our seating."
9707,"Cleaned up my nails and applied gel. Relaxing atmosphere, but a bit messy."
9708,"Always something yummy at Mykel's! Try the cornflake chicken, you can't go wrong - and their pork shank oso bucco is incredible!"
9709,Great owner.
9710,Must see
9711,"Im really not picky, but theyve got this watermelon juice that I cant live without. They have nicotine bumps and pretty great prices. Juul pods. Accessories. The whole nine. Definitely worth it all."

9732,i felt like a rockstar except instead of autographs they wanted me to be a part of the team.  Nothing makes sense and you can witness the fact you are you in your sleep. Good luck to you for your time with my mouth.
9733,They had great products and the pricing was on par with other shops. I had a much better experience the second time around. The staff was attentive and helped me with all my questions the manager even reached out to make sure I had a good experience so I will continue to shop here. I bought some clothing and i'm in the market for a new pair of boots and this shop is on top of my list for choices to buy from.

This time I tried their cheeseburger and it’s fantastic. It came out a lot faster this time, and was delicious."
9740,"Food price has gone up over the years drastically, and it always feels a little crowded and noisy in the seating area, but they have excellent coffee! The food selection is diverse and their flatbreads and baked goods are amazing! My personal favourites are the breakfast pockets and their smoothies.... people who are regulars there are friendly and the staff is always helpful."
9741,I went in the other day and Derrick (spelling) was extremely kind and professional. He answered all of my questions and even showed me one of the studs that I had questions about. Recommend this place highly for his customer service skills.
9742,Amazing products and a range of products and its actually not as expensive as i thought
9743,Great shop with great assortment and knowledgeable staff
9744,"I went there twice. First time they ran out of crab leg. The king crab pho is okay. Crab legs are tasty, pho is soso."
9745,Nice workers
9746,Maybe it is a place that will grow on you but my time there was odd
9747,"I'm an urban city girl and didn't know if I should laugh or cry walking through the store. At the front they have a board with pictures of hunters kills. It smelled like licorice that was actually bear bait. Lot's and lots of guns, knives and camo. I'm sure it's a hunter's Paradise, but for me it was pure entertainment"
9748,Great service and the sub was yummy! !😅☺😊😃
9749,"We get the funghi pizza every time. Every meal has been delightful. Lovely spot, nice atmosphere."
9750,"These people are a joke.  They say ""They are on your side"".  At the same time, they agree with the opposition."
9751,$10 for a hair cut that is not terrible. Fast service.
9752,Excellent burritos
9753,It is a fun place to visit.  The prices are very expensive. Don't forget to see the Reindeer next door.
9754,Lots of mosquito's.
9755,"Two words.  Sunday brunch. All the traditional breakfast foods, plus lunch items like cod in a lemon caper sauce. Plenty of seafood like salmon and fresh shrimp. The little deserts are all so good i can't pick a favorite."
9756,"Went here for a morning meeting. Great laid back staff. Barbie is a load of fun. Will return, for sure."
9757,Considering this is our only sporting goods store....they have saved the day on many incidents by having what is needed for all sports!
9758,I worked here.
9759,"Aptel Studio Hotel was in an ok location, it wasn't in downtown and the area was a little bit of a lower income area. We waited about 20 minutes to check in. There was another person at the desk while we waited to check in, she was on the phone talking about her dinner plans the whole time we waited. Our room itself was nice and extremely clean. It did have a mini kitchen but no plates, cups, or cookware. It was a little noisy throughout the night. It's a budget place to stay and was fine for the price."
9760,Ok price tacky interior
9761,Not pressured into a service you don't want. They listen.
9762,"The outside doesn't say much for the delicious food. The inside isn't amazing but it is fine. It was roomy and the tables are cozy. The people are nice and friendly. The menu was vast and attractive. Wait time was longer than normal but the WIFI is great. The portions were large. Always check out the soup of the day. My recommendation is the Sockeye Salmon sandwich. My grandma has been fishing for 64 years and she said ""That was the best smoked sockeye salmon she has ever had."""
9763,Good service and food at ihob! Or if it is changed back to I hope then ok
9764,Yo mama chicken is da bezzzzz!!!!
9765,You need these in your life!!! And you need them now!!
9766,"I enjoyed the historic atmosphere, friendly staff, and great subs."
9767,Great food and ice cream. Service is car hop. Love this place
9768,Awsome
9769,"First time customer and I will be a repeat customer. Chan was personable, professional and helpful. Of course, there are going to be upsells, and one should use their own discretion. However, I was impressed with the actual ""full service"" oil change! Say what?! I must say, I have been deprived going to places like Quik Lube and Alyeska Tire. All fluids were checked and filled, tire air pressure was checked and filled to match for all 4 tires, and I had no idea that I had a ""cabin air filter"" (duh!) that I okayed to be replaced because it was filthy!! This shop is located in the Northway Mall parking lot. It is super clean, and organized. I like the window in the waiting room where you can check out the cars being worked on, and see where your car is in the process. It's first come, first serve, so when I called on a Saturday to inquire if I could come in at 4 p.m., I wasn't told; ""Oh no, we are too busy."" as I have been told numerous times at Quik Lube. Instead, I was told; ""Sure, whenever you're ready come on in!"" Of course, the busy season is coming up, so timing is everything. (I have been wanting to get my oil changed since September!) I lucked out yesterday, and it truly made my day. :-) I paid the amount I expected to pay, and I will be back. Thanks Xpress Lube."
9770,The perfect Burger
9771,"Are you kidding me, primerib - GCB just went primetime!"
9772,"Its cool, i think, what were we talking about?"

9776,Great. Staff very friendly.  Live going there
9777,Have never really had a good experience from this place to start with but this pass weekend  went there for breakfast with grandkids  at 10.00 am. they had ran out of sausage  yes I get that they are getting ready for a remodel on the 9th of May but really to run out of sausage 4 days before they close. it is a very busy place in the morning and they know about how much sausages they would have to have to last for 4 more days .the staff there have never been really a nice bunch of people they act like they are doing a great thing just being there to take your order and we are just wasting their time.
9778,"Good service and good food, as authentic as possible."
9779,"Awesome food and location, right on the airport."

9789,Great selection and variety of local products.
9790,"Had breakfast. Yummy biscuits and gravy. Service, as per usual in Alaska, was not good. Missed a shuttle because of it. Ordered coffee and it tasted like they took the ashes of yesterday's coffee and added water. No wonder my stomach was upset all day. Much preferred the brew pub on property."
9791,Please bring my shrimp fiesta back.  - -
9792,My daughter loves the milkshakes! I think the pretzels are awesome!
9793,Quick is right! Friendly too.
9794,Went in and the machines went down. Went back and they had put a hold on my account so the money i set aside for registration wasnt available any longer thanks mariah
9795,"Great little place in Bethel. There's a library and there are occasional events and things going on, like the Saturday market."
9796,"Good for sports, 90% of menu is gross and overpriced."
9797,"Very friendly, very good looking staff. Best cruise in town, possibly the world. Can't imagine a better day."

9801,The troll is so slow lol
9802,"First visit was a birthday celebration of 9, seating was ideal, plenty of room yet comfy/cozy, just private enough. They were very busy but service was great throughout our evening. We had lots of tasty appetizers, all created in house; mozzy sticks, jalapeno poppers, calamari, burnt ends(pork belly), nice selection of beverages, we all ordered something different so got to see alot of good food from steaks, burgers, fish tacos, pasta dishes, and a spinach salad I will be returning for 😋cant wait to try the wings❣we were all more than satisfied. Thanks to the hardworking team that made the celebration so much fun, we'll be back."
9803,Great bread and delicious confections.  Personable staff and wonderful location.
9804,"Quick and easy oil change while you wait. When everyone, in town, was too busy to change me over to winter tires I went to SE Mine supply and they took care of me. I'm not sure what other services they offer but I've been very happy with these services and their reasonable prices"
9805,Good good camping supplies and other stuff
9806,I love the cleanliness of the restaurant. Staff were very kind and knowledgeable. Hot Pot was delicious. Tons of food and well presented. Best crab rangoon I've had in Fairbanks.
9807,All ways helpful
9808,Awesome and the hockey games they sell super nachos!!!
9809,Good selection but didnt notice I bought beer that was 4 months past it's best by date. Ended up tasting skunky they need to stay on top of that!... I doubt there is a return policy on beer.
9810,"Fun place, good burgers.  Great service.  Lots of beer"
9811,"Not great, the buffet bar had 2 dried up pizzas and a lot of empty pans.  The fresh fruit bar seemed to be nearly all canned fruit. Won't ever go back."
9812,Great selection and variety of local products.
9813,Overpriced coffee
9814,Good location to hold all your stuff.  Not open 24 hours .  Only if you pre override to get in that night...
9815,upscale quality items. When you can't find an item at other places chances are Freddy's will carry it.
9816,Super fast. Got me in immidialty with no appointment. Right to the point.
9817,"I had a great experience here. I have rough credit, but Nick listened to my situation and helped me drive away same day. I'd strongly recommend everyone to give this place a try."
9818,Fast delivery
9819,Popcorn is okay and tickets are not really great price.
9820,It was very crowded. People didn't have any sense of directions which way to walk. But tons of food vendors. Walked around that place bout 5 rounds and we had to leave.
9821,Friendly helpful knowledgeable staff
9822,Awesome food
9823,They seemed to need more help but the food was fresh and the store was clean.
9824,"Great Beer selection, one of the best Hamburgers ever!"

9828,"After the earthquake, my sister-in-law was helicoptered out after paddle boarding."
9829,"OK food, but the service needs improvement.  Not enough  servers for the number of patrons, during football season.
The wait was 15 minutes to get our order taken....that's too long!"

9831,Great staff
9832,"Food was fantastic, service was quick and friendly"

9848,"Really nice visit today! There were curators at the moose, the fox, flying squirrels answered all our questions and more 😁"
9849,"Wonderful Place! Especially if you love to see Flight landing.  (Only if they land from that direction, and that depend on wind direction.)"
9850,"(Translated by Google) very big playground.

(Original)
sehr grosser Spielplatz."
9851,Better than the other locations in town the store is cleaner and they don’t mess up your food when they are busy
9852,Great food and service
9853,"(Translated by Google) Peaceful and calm lake park.

(Original)
평화롭고 잔잔한 호수공원."
9854,The one m10x1. 0 bolt I needed they didn't have but thank God home depot was next door they had everything
9855,"Every time I go to this location it's the same woman behind the counter and every time, she puts a huge scoop of rice and a pinch of meat with a half ladle of cheese. And if you ask for more of something she acts like you just asked her feed it to you too. Very rude."
9856,"Love this little Cafe! The staff are very friendly, and their food is delicious."
9857,The cod fish was really good but the servise was terrible because the person defiantly had an aditude and the oysters are supposed to be big but it was as small as a bottle cap
9858,Great visir
9859,Drive through once a week.  Always great being a trucker.
9860,Good.
9861,I think my digestive system is unqualified for this establishment. Had the gumbo. Poor server was a bit challenged to meet the needs of the guests. Went at 6:15p on a Monday
9862,An older more run down looking place that offers some good shopping opportunities.   I enjoy the gym and Burlington.
9863,"Gas, snacks, restroom WashYourHands"
9864,Nice rooms quiet and the staff is friendly
9865,Helps people and it's old school
9866,"Obviously nobody goes to the Retinal Secialist because they are having a great time!  But the care I received on each of my half dozen or so appointments was phenomenal.  Their newly remodeled space and covid conscious cleanings made me feel right at home.  The streamlined process from check-in to check-out was efficient, professional and friendly.  Dr. Bushad (probably spelling that wrong) or “Chad” as he asked to be called was perhaps the best Doctor of any kind in any medical field I have encountered.  His ability to relate complex medical names and procedures in understandable terms was much appreciated.  Everyone in the office seemed like they really enjoyed being there and helping people.  I honestly hope I never need to see another Retinal Specialist but if I do this is definitely where I will return. Highly recommend!!"
9867,I went in for some fleece for my kids school project and no one offered to help or assist me with anything but I finally found 1 and they don't grant the prices on the aisles unless u ask about it
9868,My car is Always Clean leaving. Not like many others 🤪
9869,"Not good at all trying to get them to stand by their customer service Is tough as nails
Wouldn't recommend buying From these guys"
9870,"Service was fine as expected for a coffee kart; speedy. Ordered an americano with cream. I’m familiar with steam dots beans, I think this coffee was underwhelming it was bland in flavor and not what I was expecting. I use to barista and have my own preference for how I like the espresso, I acknowledge my preferences but this was just underwhelming felt I coulda went to holiday and gotten black drip that was more robust in flavor and body."
9871,Clean and lots of shopping options.
9872,"The food is good and affordable, and the staff is polite. However, in my opinion, the sandwiches are over priced by a dollar or two."
9873,"Cleary marked trails, park was clean, great views."
9874,The Palmer location is by far the worst location I hve been to. The parking lot is small and hard to park in. The drive through is really tight and is extremely difficult to go through in my 4 door F250. Whoever decided that this new location was a good idea should be fired.
9875,One of the best views on planet earth.
9876,"Dying mall, sad."
9877,Ordered a pizza from here it arived early and was Very good! Yummy
9878,Awesome view and awesome bathroom
9879,"Great place for quick stop.
Or bulk shopping"

9881,The budtenders are amazing. Look forward to see my girls in the A.M
9882,Central place for all events plus an excellent place to hangout.
9883,"So glad they are open again, friendly staff, good food, you get so much more like endless fries and drinks and the price is comparable to fast food, so why not eat here and get real food."
9884,Clean store helpful friendly prompt staff
9885,Pretty good WiFi
9886,Nice venue for the home show function.
9887,Love this place
9888,Great Bagel Burger and ice cream!
9889,I have purchased a lot of furniture from these guys over the years.  Great customer service and easy to deal with.  Thanks!
9890,"Great location, beautiful view of the creek and hospitality is a 5 star"
9891,This place has great meals and tasty food .. just call or stop in and order
9892,Quality coffe
9893,all kind of staff
9894,Go see the guys if that boy vapor they've got every Vapor product you need if they don't have it they can get it they love their customers and the best prices in Alaska Fairbanks Anchorage Wasilla boy they're everywhere must be a reason yeah because they Rock
9895,Breakfast is great. Service is always bad.
9896,Friendly and helpful and prices are great
9897,Good service. Attended a private work dinner. Staff was very professional. Portions were not quite filling though
9898,Love their margaritas.
9899,"We arrived late at night, and the desk service was really helpful and friendly. It's a quick drive from the airport, and then a quick drive to downtown Anchorage. We needed to pick up some odds and ends, and the hotel has a regional shuttle that will take you, free, to the local Walmart. The hotel is really well run.."
9900,Great staff and latte. I have not tried anything else but it looked goid.
9901,Good selection but often out of stock (like most of Alaska). You can order online and pickup in store. They price match too.
9902,Good food and nice cold beer!!!
9903,Not a bad location except the homeless going in and asking for money or stealing.    I like the people who work there and the security are good people.
9904,Took great care of us
9905,Love this olace good food
9906,Ok Reubens
9907,Where the South comes to the North
9908,"Of all the locations I saw while at the park, the south veiw is the best at a distance."
9909,"This place has become a staple to us. Right down the street from the La Quinta Inn & Suites Anchorage Airport, great food, great service"
9910,Very nice place to grab a beer. Everyone is chill and not trying to bother you. In my own opinion the burgers the the best burgers in town
9911,Nothing to brag about
9912,"This place as most, is expensive.  We had to request someone come straighten the cabin.  We wanted a place for 4 people to sleep.  There was a futon, extremely uncomfortable to sleep on, no new shampoos or soaps left in the room.  No real place for 4 people to sit.  Not happy for the price.  It got cold a couple of nights, they had enough blankets, grateful for that"
9913,Very nice employees
9914,Nicer strip mall on far west side of town. Lulu's Bread and Bagels for breakfast coffee on one end and Red Fox lounge for afternoon beers and pool on the other end. .. what's not to like?
9915,Great Food. We'll good again.
9916,"Great place to top off your tank and belly.  Service was prompt, restaurant was clean and inviting. The coffee was hot and the Coconut Cream pie was excellent.  I will definitely return."
9917,just another safeway :-)
9918,"Well the food could be more fresh. Sushi was grate also the clams. The desert was good but not sansational, but I don't think they were aiming for that but it was good. Better than McDonald's, but not as good as golden coral."
9919,"Love it. My number one coffee place. Good food too. Baristas are the nicest, makes my day every time."
9920,"We tent camped here for 2 nights while exploring Valdez. The center of the campground was in the open and there are treed sites around the edges. Don't expect lower foliage separating the sites. Still this is much nicer than the other RV parking lots in town which seemed wide open.

There is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold.

Wi-Fi didn't reach our site on the back edge of the campground. Overall we were happy with our stay at this campground and would stay there again."
9921,Love love their coffee and customer service.
9922,Excellent service and a great rental. Pickup at the airport and hotel were spot on.
9923,"Updated: after not following a public health mandate (and willingly putting people in danger) I have changed my below otherwise old glowing review from 5 stars to 1.
-Won't be back.

""Had both a burger and pie.. It was all delicious. The burger has to be one of the best in Anchorage - didn't like the selection of unlimited toppings for the burger.. More choices wasn't great to make it an easy experience. Portions are large, and the Oreo pie was well received by the ladies at the office I bought it for.

Will be back."""
9924,Good hotel
9925,Great easy hike. Wonderful view points. 30 minutes or less is free. Probably only $5 for day use only. Fantastic true & funny bear info posters.
9926,"Great spot, conveniently located near the people mover downtown terminal. The food is good, the beer flows cold, and the pool tables are in good shape. The staff is friendly and helpful and the place is clean and comfortable. I like it and will definitely be back."
9927,Incredible staff looking out for my needs yes i bought a new car from them best thing ive done
9928,Never try to go get flowers from here. The florist is never at the desk.
9929,"Wait staff was friendly and attentive for drinks and napkins. I had the Chipotle Chicken Rice Bowl that was awesome. Large enough portion that I took home a to go bag.  Had 1 margaritta, very good but a little spendy....$13. All good. I will go back."
9930,The dryer on the stall we used didn't even work...
9931,"Everything was delicious. Magical tacos, great service, great beer. Don't stop anywhere else, go straight here!!! Were from florida and can safely say best fish tacos anywhere!"
9932,Where I take my pictures
9933,So extremely expensive for a damn burger and fries
9934,Very Innovative Bowling Center.
9935,Great place!
9936,"Always great food,  large portions.  Moderately priced and closed on Mondays,  but we have never been disappointed"

9938,These guy dont know anything lost 2 caskets idk what kind of ppl they hire but dzmn sure not smart ones
9939,Affordable and caring

9950,Best place for physical therapy I have ever been to (even been to lots of places down south). Truly magical in there!!!
9951,The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Every thing I have tried has been very good. I highly recommend Two Sisters Bakery.

9959,It's not club but it's the closest we goat at Fairbanks
9960,"The food was Great, the service was Amazing and they even gave us free samples. As for pricing you get what you pay for. I had a cinco cinco for $15.95 and my plate was huge and I couldn't finish it and I eat a lot lol. It was the Best cinco cinco I've ever had."
9961,Cute little museum for our young kids. It was kind of small but perfect for our 3 year old who loves animals!

9964,Great dessert
9965,"(Translated by Google) Love your gluten free options.

9968,Such pizza!  Very wow!
9969,Great costumes service!!!
9970,"Great selection. I appreciate the ability to buy single beers or mix and max.

Great growler selection also. I personally can't say no to the miniature dark chocolate squares at the check out!"

9980,Couldn't get a table until over hour wait
9981,"Good burgers, better staff."
9982,"Wendy's is probably my favorite fast food burger franchise, and this location is par for the course. I would note that if you see a long line at the drive thru, then it's probably faster to go inside. The staff is friendly and easy to interact with."
9983,Did a great job with new water heater!
9984,"(Translated by Google) Fast food ... Good snack

(Original)
Muy bueno y los empleados muy amables y atentos la comida muy buena y variada"
9989,"We had one of the pet friendly rooms.... I was satisfied! The room was spotless and the staff great. The only issue was the livingroom couch. We were in room 115, the couch is very uncomfortable. The seat isn't very deep and the back is short and sloped back. Seems silly but my wife and I couldn't get comfortable when having coffee. I ended up sitting on the floor."
9990,Excellent place to get ramen! This is my favorite place to get soup (excluding pho). The restaurant is always clean and the waitstaff there aren't constantly bugging you. Prices are about what you would see in Anchorage. Be aware though that they are not open on Monday's.
9991,"Although the staff are generally friendly and helpful...the store is constantly out of basic, every-day, items. It's mid-late October right now and I couldn't even find half the office supplies I needed. This has been the case the last 4 times I have been to the store in the last year. Seems like things have really gone down hill as far as stocking goes. I will not be returning again. Very disappointing."
9992,"They provide grate services with a knowledge staff and friendly dimir, there work is highly recommended by most and is top quality speaking from experience... if you need body work done or just some paint and sanding work I'm pretty sure they have you covered plus some work/parts are covered under a gracice warranty and gives pice of mind some other shops might not offer. Hope this helps & best of luck because if your reading this you probably need some work done and I know I was happy with my results and all the recommendations I was given for this shop!"
9993,Great place to travel on a budget and meet good people. The hosts are friendly and give you great tips on must do things in anchorage.
9994,"Nice little cozy place right at the hub of the Glenn and Richardson highways. Friendly staff, quick service, and excellent food. Very reasonable prices for the somewhat remote location. They also have great breakfast options."
9995,Clean and comfortable.
9996,Grillo fireworks has been a staple for my family and our traditions for the New Year’s and the Fourth of July. The staff is always friendly the prices are always fair. They have wonderful firework shows. They’re open more then just around the two holidays. The display is awesome the monkey in the fireworks the jingle it’s just very much a staple for all Matsu Valley ppl.
9997,Hard to find help and owls are full of freight
9998,My new favorite!!
9999,"Granted, they were a little shakey when they first opened, but they got their stuff together now"
10000,In Alaska and we actually were in there 3 or 4 times
10001,They over filled my oil when I paid for an oil change. I mentioned it a few days later and  didn't even offer to double check if it is overfull. I checked my self. It's way too much oil. Won't be going back.
10002,Beautiful walk with the kiddos! Stay tuned for outdoor wildlife events for kids. We attended a fantastic kids wildlife day!
10003,Best meal for the price.
10004,"Loved it. Pool and gym on sight as well as restaurants and a bar, rooms were clean and well kept. Employees were knowledgeable. Gift shops withing the hotel and was walking distance to most sights in Anchorage"
10005,"Ah yes.  Delicious food.  My wife loves it here as well.  Great staff.  The ordering process is a bit different but just grab a menu,  decide what sounds good and walk up and order.  8/10"
10006,Always have what im looking for and staff friendly & helpful
10007,Beautiful views from the top of Pillar
10008,Be a nicer place if it had better seating to be able to watch the kids better.
10009,Don't trust them
10010,"Loved it, great food. Have a granddaughter  named Sami!🙂"
10011,Good Mexican food
10012,Absolutely stunning!
10013,All season spot. Love blueberry of this place.
10014,"Quick and nice staff, but charge waaaaay too much for basic things."
10015,Great prices
10016,Dont like the pot holes
10017,"Best cafe I've ever been to. Prices are good, the food is along the lines of Himalayan comfort food. It gets me out of my comfort zone by assuring that everything will taste amazing! The hot chai is a must."
10018,"(Translated by Google) Everything

10019,Good food. Fried okra was da bomb
10020,"This is a well maintained and very quiet RV park. It has a dumping station as well as a water station, so you don't have to run into town to dump and fill. At 17 dollars a night, including electric hookups, it is also very reasonable"
10021,The employee Hailey did a great service.👍👍👍👌
10022,Great spot
10023,Fixed faster and less expensive than the dealer.
10024,Helped me get back on the road thanks guys!!!

10027,Old pump
10028,The parts I need
10029,Good breakfast and clean.  My only complaint was that you could every noise your neighbors would make.
10030,"My steak was great, but this is three times in a row that we were told they were out of prime rib!  Really?!!  Who does the ordering?!!!!"
10031,Great customer service. Honest assessment of car issues.
10032,"Nice atmosphere, good place to visit after the gym. Better walking distance than the one in Carrs"
10033,they are always having supply problems
10034,Always have a good selection of seafood!
10035,"Because they are the only one in the Soldotna, Kenai area."
10036,Stunning and luxurious hotel on the center of Anchorage. Staff sang Happy birthday to my mom at check in and made it extra special for here. Many amazing sights and glaciers are viewable within driving distance from here. Also the lounge has amazing views of Anchorage and the area. Definitely recommended.
10037,Modern center hosting the cultural elements of the natives
10038,"Awesome insurance, wonderful people who really care!"
10039,Great service. They treat my pets with lots of love but they NEVER answer the phone.
10040,"Amazing cakes, best boba in town.  Can’t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!!!"
10041,Nice park for dogs on a leash
10042,"As always, beautiful and amazing."
10043,Love this place. Great beers and staff is amazing. Nice place to spend after work time.
10044,Best pizza slices in Alaska! They only serve them till 5pm. Try the Nona salad with walnut dressing- sublime!
10045,"PX does not have much and/or selection. Might as well go down town for everything that is not grocery. Not worth the time to go visit PX

Ft Wainwright Commissary is great for large grocery shopping.  Don't buy milk there,  because it's about $1.00 more an gallon compared to downtown Fairbanks.  They take advantage of the WIC program when it comes at least to milk. Sometimes when you buy meat,  bring it home,  and leave in refrigerator for a day or two,  the meat is already going bad"
10046,Best hotel in Seldovia.  Overlooks the harbor where you can watch sea otters play in the harbor. The time lapses were filmed in the room and outside on the deck if their restaurant.
10047,Amazing thing to do in city to shut out city life if you know what i mean
10048,Fish and chips were not messing around
10049,Good Food and Good People.
10050,A view to remember.
10051,Loved it
10052,Ihhhha cowboy i like alska
10053,I didnt receive all the items I paid for almost $200 in items. Then the buy 3 get 2 free sale wasn't even honoredl
10054,Service was excellent.  Place does feel kinda dated  but otherwise great!!o
10055,Great icecream
10056,this store is huge! We had a great time I got everything we needed for our project! LMAO
10057,Favorite Safeway West of the Mississippi!
10058,Very professional service and very friendly.
10059,Nice fishing area.  Too bad the fish weren't biting!
10060,Clean friendly
10061,Well stocked and clean. Prices comparable for the location
10062,I live in this place. Love coming here. Great options for the whole family..Vegan/Vegetarian tasty options....a must if you're ever in Anchorage Alaska.
10063,"My girlfriend and I had tempura appetizer, ronnie 1 & 2, not even remotely good for sushi. 55 dollar disappointment. I wish I didn't eat there."
10064,Its depressing as it's a reminder that we used to have a cool place to go
10065,Strawberry cosmopolitan. My wife and I shared one but you might as well get one yourself. Over the top good. Tower of Tuna and Bean Cheese and Chips. Everything was better than I could ever explain. Waitress was beyond cute and adorable and very efficient. Told us she only works there when they need her.
10066,"Food was great!   Big portions.  More than we expected.    Loved the garnish bar.   Self serve for sauces, pico, guac, sour cream, etc.    Will definitely go again next time we are down there."
10067,Kind of pricey... But still good.
10068,Great job
10069,"Delicious, well maintained area, interesting visit."
10070,"Awesome little place for breakfast. The breakfast sandwiches are really good. Great coffees too! Will definitely go back when we are in Seward again. It is a little expensive, just like any place downtown."
10071,"It's a carrs, it's not as busy as most, and you can get your shopping done pretty quick"
10072,Always enjoyed the friendly and accommodating service down at Craig Taylor. Great selection of equipment and parts and if they don’t have they always work to get it for you.
10073,"Staff was very helpful, great selection and awesome vibe"
10074,Great views
10075,"Our food was good, well made, and this unit has a great Asst. Manager who will make a great Manager due to his lead by example approach and Customer Service skills."
10076,Excellent service and and large portions. The pancakes were awesome.
10077,Very nice experience.  Quality food.  Very fast good service.  Delicious...
10078,This place was very helpful. The representative was Soraiya and she’s the store manager. It’s quiet and they do take the time to help you.
10079,Best fried chicken in town
10080,"This train depot dates back to the original colonists' arrivals to the Matanuska Valley during the 1930s. It's a City of Palmer historic landmark. Rarely used anymore for its original purpose, it is now Palmer's community center.

I just attended a middle school graduation for a granddaughter here. Recent upgrades and renovations have taken away from it's historic ambiance, but were much-needed. While I sorta miss that the flooring doesn't creak and moan anymore and the old feel of the depot was sacrificed for sake of modernity and functionality, the graduation went well, in part thanks to the improvements.

The exterior of the depot remains original and is worth a look if you're in Palmer town."
10081,"Super in every way! Shuttle, clean, friendly staff, owner present and involved. Great redo since I was there a few years ago.  I'll ALWAYS stay here when I Juneau."
10082,"I love there sesame chicken, for those of you who don't know they have an express menu if you look on there counter you'll see it. also you can sub the soup if your like me and would rather have a soda.
These people are fast and respectful, I always enjoy seeing them."
10083,"We usually go here once or twice a week, but last time we went, we decided to order inside as the drive thru was long. I watched the staff take and process 17 drive thru orders before making mine, after I had ordered. I stood there for 20 minutes and then because 2 doordash delivery people came in, they rushed their orders ahead of ours. I never said anything to anyone about it, I stood quietly and waited.. Someone loaded each of our burgers with 10-15 pickle slices. We hadn't asked for any changes or anything to our meals, just regular orders. Luckily they were easy to remove, however, with the recent issue of them serving undercooked chicken, and then this on top of it, it makes me think their new manager is not running this place correctly."
10084,"I do not know what's going on with them, but the place smells awful!! I used to be a repeat customer but now I cannot get past the smell even with mask on!!!"
10085,Found everything I needed except shallots an decent Roma tomatoes!
10086,Food is okay service was good.
10087,"Normally great, this time order completely wrong when I arrived home, switched bags?"
10088,Comfy chairs! Fairly clean for a movie theatre.
10089,Awesome selections of quality products.
10090,"Went on their customer appreciation day, I expexted it to be busy and it was. .Not the issue. The issue is I ordered 2 medium pepperoni pizzas and theor cinnamon bites. They made the cinnamon bites first, which were of course not even the slightest bit warm by the time I got my 2 pizzas 21 minutes later. Yes, the bites were done in the first five, then the pumped out a bunch of regular cheese/pepperoni pizzas which took 21 more minutes to get me my stuffed crust. Also I had ordered 2 medium stuffed crust, which should have been $6 additional for the stuffed crust per their menu ( 3 for med, 3.50 for large) but was charged $7. Whrn I asked about it the cashier stated it was 3.50 each, I pointed to the sign which said 3...and he again said 3.50.

I only give 2 stars because the pizza was what I expected out of cheap stuffed crust pizza, else it would have been 1. Seriously bad service."
10091,"A little slow, (new store) but food was just like I remember!"
10092,Always great service and food!
10093,Not bad a little far out of the way but a basic mall
10094,"Great place to take any small engine repair's,"
10095,Always the the best Espresso Shake.
10096,A good place to get some exotic snacks
10097,Best place to buy food
10098,Please clean up the garbage all over the C street side of your lot. It's disgusting it's starting to look like a dump from the sidewalk.
10099,"This is certainly a Fred Meyers. Not much that is exciting about it, but I have been enjoying the new artisanal cheese area of the building. Lots of nice cheeses, meats, and other things for small plates that feel classy and taste delicious. Also, like all Freddy's, it has an Alaska USA branch that is open on Sundays, making this my primary place for banking. Lots of lanes, as well as around 16 self checkout stands (depending on how many are functional or open at a given time)."
10100,Pretty good ngl
10101,"Took my '12 Ram 1500 in for a transmission service and to change the gear oil in both differentials. Dropped off at 8:30am and was called at 11am to tell me it was done. Fast and efficient, but also kinda pricy. Expect that. Less expensive than the dealership though. Didn't try to sell me additional services as I didn't need them. Honesty. I like that!"
10102,Great selection of food products
10103,"Always delicious, and always takes a bit to get through the line"
10104,Price too high for the amount of food given and sushi was not all too good.. customer service was aahn..
10105,"Great wings, good service, good price"
10106,"It's Costco, nuff said."
10107,Very scenic
10108,Watch for poop on floor
10109,Best pizza in Anchorage love it
10110,Great customer service and very knowledgeable.
10111,Excellent and very friendly service. Love the layout easy to navigate even with a toddler in tow. Look forward to  some good Christmas shopping here!
10112,"Compared to other places on this side of town, you have more beer options and different food choices that were not available at other venues. Highly recommend their steak tips."
10113,Love Ray's place!! Super sweet service and always delicious food!! ♡
10114,Beautiful scenery!
10115,"Food was not as good as it used to be.  The servers need LOTS more training.  After the meal, we paid - before leaving the person with me had to use the restroom and while I was waiting for them in the lobby,  the waiter who served us tried to seat me again...he didn't even remember me!"
10116,"Huge,beautiful visitor center,watch the movie its amazing"
10117,Been going there for almost 14 years
10118,Well organized Walmart.
10119,When I got their had to wait awhile it was frustrating. But I always love the out come of the dogs being groomed
10120,"The Mudslide Martini is awesome! !
Ohh, so are the crab cakes, cheese curds & Cuban sandwich!"
10121,"Good little saloon, love the entry doors, was very crowded when I was there, but 3 cruise ships were pulled into the harbor though."
10122,Love this place
10123,Very tasty wide selection of options.
10124,"They have what you need, but some of it is a bit pricey."
10125,The best food in Homer
10126,Great for supplies-i get my yeast and syrups and other hard to find supplies there
10127,"Limited parking, no facilities, good trail access"
10128,It's a liquor store! They have decent selection and are open late!
10129,Love the bundle of stuff I can save more money
10130,Love the salad bar and I love the many selections
10131,Love the biscuits and gravy.
10132,"I live pretty close and shop here often. They recently re-arranged the store, which has made things hard to find. It also seems like certain items aren't being restocked. I'm mainly seeing this problem with reloading supplies. It would be nice to see some improvements in this area, as ordering powder, primers, etc. in Alaska is a real pain.

I would also think that the economy of scale afforded by such a large company would enable them to offer more competitive pricing, but that's usually not the case. Many (if not most) items can be found for lower prices elsewhere.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the checkout process is ridiculous and overcomplicated. They really need to streamline this. There is no sense in soliciting phone numbers when our state has only one area code.

All things considered, it's still a neat store and I'll continue to shop around here from time to time."
10133,"Always enjoyable with the family.  Today, my first steak was mostly gristle, but what can I expect? Also, desserts were really slow on this day. Most desserts were empty or unavailable for over 15 minutes during the time we were there."
10134,Don't really help like they should
10135,"Local, personal, a part of the community, fun, great baked goods made on location."
10136,Really good pizza!!!!
10137,"3 stars for service and 5 stars for food. We had 8:15 reservation and were seated quickly on a very busy Thursday night. Drink orders came out promptly but appetizers took 45 minutes and the meal took 1 hr 15 mins. Wait staff was apologetic and blamed it on a new chef and his crew. Pretty expensive also. When we finally got our meal, it was excellent. Chef special halibut definitely top 5. In spite of the great food, i doubt I'll be back.  I don't usually have 2 hours for a meal."
10138,"Good hotel room, nice worker got me a soda for free , good breakfast,  good place to stay for a while"
10139,Awesome deals
10140,"I only visited to help cater a wedding, so I can't speak as a true guest or of the companies services.... but this place is beautiful! With a movie theater room and a swimming pool and deep hot tub to boot! And you really can't best the views! If you get the chance to check this place out you should definitely do it!"
10141,Great place to find anything you need. Nice people
10142,Clean and basic. Middle of town and 250 dollars. This would be 75 dollar room in the lower 48 for comparison.
10143,Great campground by the river!
10144,They got my order wrong but they took the time to correct it. I always stop at this CJ. They always do a good job and they go above and beyond expectations.
10145,Is was so easy working with George Fox. Thank you George!
10146,"Went with a pretty huge party, and had the room off to the left reserved. Our waitress was absolutely on point, fun, and excited about the food and drinks she was serving. The filet was perfectly cooked, and the tiramisu was legitimately something to write home about. Don't let the location of this place fool you - it is spectacular."
10147,"Super busy, produce isn't that great, clothing section is usually pick thru."
10148,"Nice cool trail system, some easy, some less easy :)"
10149,Clean and quiet mall to enjoy walking around or enjoy a cup of coffee.
10150,Staff is great! A great family business!
10151,Such a beautiful place helping Ultra keep there products updated
10152,Always awesome service
10153,"For being at the top of Alaska's oil pipeline and in a city comprised of purely working folk. Its a decent size store with a large variety of goods. Also NAPA is below it so you get the best of both worlds!

Prices are reasonable too. :)"
10154,"Solat Ali was really great to us, we were first time buyers and he was very patient and understanding for us and helped us get an amazing deal on our new car and we cant thank him enough. Definately will recommend to friends looking for a new used car at a great price."
10155,Called to ask about a product. The employee cut me off before I had even asked my question. Went in anyway. No employees to be found to direct me to what I was looking for. Wandered the store about 10 - 15 minutes and left. Never saw a single employee. Would not spend my money here.
10156,Great buffet with a big selection. Good price.
10157,Nice place
10158,Everything was fresh!
10159,I just got my hair colored and done up by Anita and she was great! Not only was it an enjoyable conversation but she was able to be really creative with my colorful peekaboo. 😀 10/10
10160,Is not maintained or watched very well
10161,"Great prices, and selection."
10162,"Beer was okay, our waiter sucked. Not all our food came out. I spoke to the manager and all he said was sorry even when I asked him how he was going to fix this issue."
10163,Great place to see the bears and caribou. Mt. Denali are very beautiful.
10164,"(Translated by Google) It is always nice to see sincere smiles!)

(Original)
Всегда приятно видеть искренние улыбки!)"
10165,"Fantastic, large nursery! They have just about anything you could be looking for.... Then plus some."
10166,Cheapest gas prices and great staff
10167,"This absolutely has to be one of the best places in Juneau. It is a gem off the beaten path and surrounded by many trails, beaches and various things to do while on Douglas Island. The staff were phenomenal; attentive, friendly, courteous, kind, cheerful and a real pleasure to be around. The restaurant itself was beautiful inside and out, very pleasing astetically, and immaculately maintained. And now for the food. Everything on the menu looked amazing but it was unfortunate the inability to try it all. The wings were fantastic and the steak sandwich was.as.well. Their pizzas and toppings had me wishing I could somehow make more room. I will definitely be hanging out there with every visit to Juneau!!!"
10168,"Easily the best haircuts in town, would recomend."
10169,Delicious breakfast!!
10170,Food is delicious and the prices are great! Service was really good too.
10171,Great price for great food
10172,Fun AND delicious!
10173,Should make the place a bit better. Not many options for the kids round here.
10174,Wicked awesome!
10175,"I mean, it's Target. There's not much to say here. Target is great."
10176,"Nice classic bar with good food , service is fair yet polite."
10177,Very friendly and helpful staff!
10178,This is a must try for great food in Anchorage.
10179,"Worst steak in Fairbanks so far, especially for a steak house.  Took forever was over cooked and other pork dishes were raw. No consistency. They do have some good dishes but it's a gamble."
10180,Always professional and easy to work with.  I love any business in Alaska that recognizes that we're not living in the 1970s anymore
10181,The staff was very helpful and friendly!
10182,The best breakfast- eggs Benedict with salmon.
10183,Great prices!
10184,All three pets go here for vet services + grooming. All the doctors and staff are so nice and helpful. We moved across town a few years ago and still go to VCA East.
10185,Great service and the sub was yummy! !😅☺😊😃
10186,Amazing wilderness!
10187,Best pizza in Alaska
10188,Not a long line at all
10189,"Great pizza, had a great, friendly server."
10190,Some of the best Biscuits and Gravy along with Bacon on the Buffet. Great quality food and service. I would say one of the best in Soldotna
10191,Food is good and fair prices.
10192,Good pizza.
10193,Great trails for biking!
10194,Very good service.
10195,If they sold groceries I'd never leave

10199,Everytime I have brought a car in the work was perfect and to the specs I wanted tint and led interior kit. Will be back soon
10200,Great food and a great staff. I've never been disappointed when I go here.
10201,Trivia night on Wednesdays is a lot of fun. The staff is also on the ball making sure we had everything we needed. Excellent customer service.
10202,Best Burgers In Anchorage
10203,I love going here with my kids
10204,Wish they would get new customer service already.
10205,The bathrooms where dirty. Staff was not helpful. Took forever to get checked in.
10206,"Great staff. Allowed me to check the size of items on my pups before I bought them. Were quick to refund the unwanted items with no hassle. Helped with product knowledge and purchasing. Excellent experience, all around."
10207,"Clean, nice staff, great vegetables"
10208,Great place
10209,home Depot has always been a great place to visit for my home projects.  the staff are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  they have NEVER failed to know what aisle the items I need are in.
10210,Friendly and knowledgeable staff.
10211,"Good burger, not in Tommy's league, but nearby. Ask for fries/onion rings well done. The highlight was the Alaskan Cranberry Tart beer."

10216,Pretty neat
10217,Cool spot to chill out
10218,"The Alaska Zoo is a nice size for such a small City and state.  It is well worth the price to stop in and support their efforts.  Strollers with small wheels are difficult to manage on the gravel paths.  Wagons work find and large tire strollers.  I suggest winter, spring, as best for the animals, in the summer they nap a lot.  Don't forget to check their website for the live polar bear webcam."
10219,"Has a trail for every hiking level! Waterfalls, valleys, Glaciers, peaks of different height, Lakes, you name it!"
10220,"Great Store, Great Staff, Tons of Selection. Dont miss it."
10221,Nice place to vist but a little over priced. 2 Texas Gal's
10222,"We stayed in the open area, and it was ok. Protected from wind, quiet. There is another small camp area in the trees that I fidnt see, but looked nice. Ok for pasding thru."
10223,best pizza place in wasilla!
10224,"Three of us went for lunch... We all ordered different things, and it was all great. Don't change anything."
10225,Bought some birds. They are great at handling the animals and are full of great information. They are so appricated.
10226,Fun for the kids and anyone in town. and the food is great at the salmon bake.
10227,"I was just in yesterday looking for a helmet with a heated visor.  I found some 509 R3 Helmets that caught my attention, but was confused that the R3 was modular in design.  I left and did some web research to confirm and found that (I believe) they are putting 509 R4 Helmets in R3 boxes and keeping the pricing at the R3 price ($150 more vs. the R4 price).

According to the 509 Website, the Delta R3 Carbon Fiber Ignite helmet is NOT a modular helmet, the Delta R4 Ignite is a modular helmet (and $150 less).

Purchased my 509 R4 on-line from a reputable source.   In part due to size selection, but I wouldn't have gone back after seeing their (assumed intentional) methods of mis-marking items."
10228,Great fast service the hostess even went around and brought everyone mints
10229,I’m surprised and happy find BTY Dental.  Thank you to Dr Jeon and his sidekick.  I was fortunate to get the amount of work done for the amount of time.  I really appreciate that my treatment plan was explained to me in a way that was easy for me to understand.  I’ve got some life left in my teeth and they’re looking good thanks to them.
10230,"Great tour, train and pipeline a bonus!!"
10231,"You deserve to treat yourself.  I love the Cubanos here, friendly staff.  Great find."
10232,Very helpful
10233,"A fantastic place to watch wildlife, peaceful and relaxing don't forget to bring a camera!"
10234,tastee
10235,Staff was friendly and helpful with answering questions and assisting with prizes. Food could have been better but was acceptable.
10236,"(Translated by Google) Good fiod good service

Good fiod good service"
10237,Love it but Abit expensive
10238,Beautiful and easy walks/hikes. Some paved walking areas.
10239,"I remember this being my favorite wing place. However the quality has shifted a bit, with how long they make you wait for your food I expect they at least evenly coat the wings in sauce. Not only that but my $4 soda was watered down. I love this place I really do but I simply can't give it a higher rating"
10240,House balls are a bit overly chipped. Prices are above norm but overall that's to be expected due to this facility being the only alley in the valley.
10241,Nice people and facilities
10242,"Great atmosphere, especially for Vikings fans!! They had great deals and the wings were gigantic. Great place to watch games and hang out"
10243,"Best semi-fast food in area, clean, decent food...burgers."
10244,Nice clothes.
10245,I have been here several times now and everytime the food was delicious and the service was great!
10246,"A wonderful church, get next to God, the anchor is there ....."
10247,Great Chinese and sushi. The summer roll and the eggplant entree were absolutely delicious!
10248,Everyone loved there food although it took a while to get
10249,"Wasn't sure what a hoagie house. We weren't even sure that the little place was still there, as a friend suggested it. We found it, and sure enough its still there.

We enteted and were seated promptly. Though it was right about lunchtime, the service was quick and friendly. Many more customers had followed us in and each was greeted happily.

I loved the presentation of the menu, both the clipboard table and the wall mural. The French Onion soup was delicious, but I was not impressed with the potstickers. We quickly learned what a hoagie house was - DELICIOUS!"
10250,I love getting my donuts from them they are always friendly when serving me. Also their coffee is not bad either i end up now getting coffee and donuts. My only draw back is there is no high chairs which is fine my life one sits on my husband's lap and eats his donuts. Otherwise it's a great place oh if you want a certain type of donut get there before 10 am otherwise you miss out. Some days its more like 9am but seriously if you want good donuts this is the place.
10251,"What an Amazing Store. Highly recommend going to see this store. It is so well designed and built. Custom everything, lots of wood and metal, great products, highly recommend their vape pens, incredibly smooth. I will be stopping in again."
10252,Must stop when traveling between Homer and Anchorage. Great place.
10253,Best place in town by far.
10254,Mcds
10255,"I needed a cover for a very bad tattoo someone else in town did. I wanted it done in a hurry, JT told that there was a process and I need to be patient if I wanted it done correctly. I glad I listened to him. He really knows his stuff and he is very talented. Im so happy I chose him. Thank you JT !!!"
10256,One of my favorite places. Lots of trails!!!
10257,Authentic Mexican food. Great salsa and comfy setting. The best Mexican food in Juneau
10258,Great date night or friend gathering. Love the biscuits and gravy for breakfast/brunch.
10259,The place stinks and the stock has been thete for 100years.
10260,Have not been here in a while. Formerly one of my favorite restaurants. Not any more. Portions were meager at best. What I used to share with a friend was not enough for one. Terrible disappointment.
10261,"Great refs, fun and fast paced games"
10262,"Great bakery goods, very good food. Don't waste your money elsewhere on Chinese food. Not fancy inside, but awesome chow."
10263,"In honor of all veterans, well maintained, good view of Denali (if not hiding behind clouds)"
10264,Staff sucks.
10265,It is a really nice park with a wide open grassy area but could use some updates.
10266,You will not find a better heating and plumbing team in anchorage. Chris was awesome! Don’t bother going anywhere else
10267,Gr8 service and Cody did awesome delivering in the snow lol poor guy👍
10268,"Great service, they know their stuff. Friendly professional service."
10269,Best German food in town. Great beers on tap well.
10270,Awesome service and great Cooks
10271,Everything in the store cheaper online.
10272,Great food!
10273,"Place is inviting and comfortable...has a semi-formal vibe. Service is top notch. The food is superb. Flavors abound in carefully crafted and creative salads, tapas, and entrees. Some of my favorites include: the duck preparations, the halibut risotto small plate, the calamari, and the roast beet salad!"
10274,Very friendly staff and patrons. Very reasonably priced drinks.
10275,Only had cold water lots of broken machines
10276,Beautiful.
10277,Lots of memories here
10278,Very good flavors. Way better than most enchiladas and tacos in Anchorage. My wife liked her street tacos too. The avocado salsa is delicious.
10279,Best pie in America
10280,Same stuff different year except everything is about $1 more then last year
10281,Very accomodating
10282,"For service would rather talk to each other instead of helping a paying customer stale fries,  Every time I go to the McDonald's in mount view I'm always shorted something it be  Cold fries it be 10 mcnuggets missing very badd accuracy on the food . Granted they did make up this time what the Apple pie and some fries but that was me having to go back to get what I paid for the last time they told me no no nothing I don't know why I keep going back"
10283,Nice place to go if not a pro
10284,ok but i don't like it
10285,Gokd food
10286,I live for this place it where a kid can be kid and have Pizza play player for hours I miss the firefighter game they had
10287,Great company
10288,Its McDonald's. Its fast and okay.
10289,Quick easy and cheap
10290,The chicken I had off the buffet was quite good. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. The salad bar was fresh and tasty. I liked the option to have the cook do BBQ for you.
10291,"Simply put, great food. Actually, amazing food. The 3 stars are simply for the most confused waiter whose English was so poor that he struggled understanding the menu even pictures on the menu were shown to him. The issues occurred at other tables. I feel bad because I believe he was trying his best yet it really was a blight on our experience. Again, the food was incredible."
10292,"I have always liked the Three Bears Organization and the much needed services they provide their smaller communities. It's very close to having a Costco. I frequent them in Big Lake. They generally have what I need and a lot of what I want. However, based on my experience the last couple of months, I plan to shop elsewhere, which will prove difficult since the choices in or near Big Lake are none and few, respectively.

Unlike Costco, Three Bears stores do not have a mask mandate. I was there a week ago. Out of about 50 customers, 4 in addition to me were wearing masks. Out of a dozen staff assisting customers, only 2 were wearing masks. My cashier wasn't wearing one. What was even more disgusting to me was the food preppers and servers in the deli weren't wearing masks, not one!

I am a senior citizen. I have an underlying health condition, and even if I didn't, I don't want to be exposed to Covid 19. It doesn't bother me that another elderly woman laughed at me for wearing a mask; it bothers me a large portion of the population in the Mat-Su are treating masks politically. I heard some one say, ""A mask isn't a political statement; it's an IQ test."" Its sad to say, in the area, concern for one's neighbor is low.

Again, if you need to shop, it fills the need. If you care about your health, take precautions and be prepared for ridicule."
10293,Good
10294,"As always, a good place to see about Alaskan-based company for canopy, camper and RV needs."
10295,Nice place. Good food
10296,"It's the State fair....Its the sights, the smells, the food, the people you haven't seen since this time last year when you bumped into them at the fair and said you should get together soon and ""I'll message you on **(insert social media app)**.""  Knowing fully well that you have no intention of ever doing it.  You've be reminded in your brief interaction exactly why you no longer associate with them and are secretly hoping that no one else you may know will see you conversing with them.
It's all those things and a lumberjack show.

Actually the fair is a well done event that locals look forward to all year.  If you're reading this to decide if you want to go.  JUST GO..."
10297,Very helpful
10298,Customer service is great! Good selection!
10299,"Hotel rooms are spacious, right next to downtown and no trouble parking. I didn't enjoy the breakfast too much, not much of a selection. Employees were nice."
10300,Good food. Good service
10301,"Had an auto start put in, only took a few hours and the service was awesome."
10302,Great coffee and hot cocoa in the morning
10303,"(Translated by Google) Yes, really good Food. The best are the quesadillas.

(Original)
Yes, really good Food. Lo mejor son las quesadillas."
10304,Love this place. It's like going to an adult Toys-R-Us.
10305,I went there for lumber and they sent me to an actual lumber store because they couldn't cut the limber to the size I wanted.
10306,Nice and clean and good customer service.
10307,They always have great deals
10308,Good group of guys. Courteous and honest.
10309,Great service safe storage friendly staff
10310,"Low-cost hotel, carpet always need cleaning, it was ok if you're on a tight budget, but there is always a quantity of panhandlers. In the hotel. The rooms, bathrooms sheets and bedding always have been clean."
10311,Great tasting food for a decent price.
10312,Troy is fantastic at his job. If you want a home inspection that actually identifies all of the issues and potential issues that a home/building has Troy is who you want.
10313,"Great place for many activities. Fun and safe for kids of all ages. Great walking,running, and biking paths. A little library to pick up or drop of books to share with others. A short little walk down to the beach along the ""poetry pathway"" where children in the community have written poems to share with everyone along the walk. Many outside bbq grills. Clean restrooms. Great view of the Kenai beach. 4 large covered pavilions. Basketball court. Volleyball net. Lots of open grass to do outside activities. Great place to go! I love this park!"
10314,Excellent for birthdays
10315,Thank goodness for the shuttle! I'd still be walking back to the shop from downtown otherwise...
10316,I'm glad there open again and really like the approach they've taken for keeping everyone safe.
10317,"""Great customer service In N Out is a great place to run into family"""
10318,"I always have an enjoyable time, and I'd say I camp here at least twice a summer. Very personable campground hosts. Reasonable firewood prices (comparable to town prices). There is a little general store less than a mile away for odds and ends you probably forgot (lighter, eggs... I've been guilty of both).

5 minute walk to the lake from your camping spot. 5 minute walk to the head of a couple hiking trails. Well kept bathroom facilities. Community bear chests (wish you had a personal one at each lot).

Very, very active bear country. I ran into two black bears at the very beginning of Twin Peaks trail. Another as I drove out, just walking down the middle of the road. Just be aware. Be prepared."
10319,Best pizza in Barrow.
10320,High prices and small portions.
10321,"First of all the staff were excellent from the moment we walked in. There were also some local folks that helped us out immensely. More about that later. The food was prepared perfectly to order and the wait staff was very professional. The salad bar was very very good with a great selection. We had the prime rib with baked potato. Perfectly prepared. I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Turtle Club

Now to the local folks. We arrived about an hour and a half early. I decided to turn around and go for a ride to kill some time before our reservation. Well I got stuck and could not get out no matter what I tried. So we walked down to the restaurant figuring we would have to get a wrecker during or after our meal. Unbeknownst to us someone from the wait staff in the bar saw what happened and was ready to assist us before we even walked in. Then some of the sweetest folks just pulled me out and said that now I could enjoy my evening which we certainly did. It says alot about  the local area. I was very appreciative."
10322,"This was a pretty smooth purchase. Mark Uy found me the right car on the first try, showed me how to use the technology in the car as well as on the app and kept me updated while they washed the spring dust off and topped off the gas. He answered all of my questions and found answers when he wasn’t sure, which I appreciated.

It’s going to take a while to get used to the hybrid but that’s an experience I look forward to. Its also nice to know that if there are any issues Toyota will make sure they get worked out.

Phillip in finance was easy to work with and the service department was great getting me scheduled for my first maintenance visit."
10323,Not enjoyable or easy.
10324,They owe us money.... we have a IOU written on our receipt
10325,Beautiful nails everytime.  Standing g appt every friday.  Lein is the best.
10326,Really chill and can jus take my time looking around without rushing.  Love both the Quantity and Quality of product there
10327,"A little over priced, very ""institutional"" type food.
Mediocre at best..."
10328,Great greens
10329,The twins make this place a real treat to visit
10330,"I've been going to Pairmore & Young for about a month. I went because a friend recommended it.  Honestly I was skeptical, but I have to admit it's starting to help. Dr. Jerz was very clear about what she hoped to accomplish and told me that it wasn't going to happen right a way. In the last month I've noticed my pain decrease, I'm able to do more and I'm not reaching for the Tylenol, ice, and heat everytime I finish a chore like I was. That had changed my skepticism into hope.
I recommend that if your having pain that you give Pairmore and Young a try, they have proven to me they will be right up front with what they can and can't help your with."
10331,Great place for kids
10332,Always a fun place to shop.
10333,I to my dog cowboy to the vet on Ft. wainwright and they determined that he had a significant tumor on his spleen that needed removed as soon as possible. I gave multiple vets a call to see when they could get me in and they all gave m the run around. I called Aurora Animal Clinic and they were extremely helpful over the phone. Any questions I asked that the receptionist did not know asked the Vet after we got off and called m back. They were able to adjust their schedule enough to get cowboy in that day. Dr. Pestch (spelling) did an amazing job and cowboy was back to normal within a few days. The entire team was amazing. This place is the best Animal clinic I have been to (12 clinics in 4 states).
10334,Great service good environment. Good food
10335,Such a beautiful place to go for a nature walk and easy to get to!
10336,"Restaurant is very nice, rooms........."
10337,Very nice and professional
10338,Always helpful and accommodating to my order modifications.
10339,"Stunning views, wonderful staff, gorgeous hotel."
10340,"Love the variety here, and impressed with the expansion of the pet area."
10341,Legit
10342,"I really enjoyed the pizza from this Papa John's location. This was my first time visiting since the remodel. I went around 7pm and they were quite busy but helped me as soon as they could. I showed the lady at the register my PJ phone app which had a BOGO coupon. She admitted that she hadn't heard of that coupon but that she would honor it anyway. She said our pizzas would be ready in 20. My husband and I killed some time at Fred Meyer, came back in about 20, and our pizzas were ready and hot. The taste was perfect. I would recommend anyone wanting tasty pizza in the valley to check out this Papa John's location."
10343,Great park on the coastal trail . awesome 😎👍🏽
10344,"I asked for the best Gram of flower i could get for twenty bucks.  The lady gave me stoney creek kush.  It was dry, burnt extremely quick and after smoking the whole bag did nothing for me and my girlfriend.  Would give zero stars but not allowed. I'm very upset i wasted my money."
10345,We went to it because it was the only restaurant we could find open after 8 pm.  It had a great views and kind of an older classic hotel restaurant feel.  The food was good.  We all enjoyed the seafood dishes.  It was a nice place to eat.
10346,Amazing hoagies but I think they are a little over priced for the amount of food you get. I got a sandwich fries and a water and my bill was close to 28 dollars.
10347,I love the national parks system in the USA! Denali is so well run and beyond gorgeous. Everyone professional and helpful at the very least. Inspiring bus drivers!
10348,Frist time and love it service was Awsome
10349,"Not too shabby. Quality made pizza (af far as franchises go). Way better than Pizza Hut.
The Philly Pizza is great. So far, the crew seems friendly and customer oriented."
10350,Busy. You must have an appointment
10351,Very nice people there. Reminds me of old 60s style motel/travel lodge. Would recommend. Price was kinda steep for 1 night (184)
10352,Mile High Thai  and Spicy Garlic - wow these wings rock!
10353,Very good customer service.
10354,Lovely
10355,The best seafood chowder Eva!
10356,Knowledgeable staff that made it fast and easy for me to buy a trailer!
10357,"Fast and well made burgers so far as fast food is concerned. No dollar menu, though. The most expensive McD I've ever been to and the only one in town."
10358,Not the best customer service. Not much variety. Expensive prices.
10359,"Went in this morning to purchase a 1/4"" Rigid impact that was on sale. Found it easy, found a lady working to help with the item because it has a security tag no problem. She asks if I'm ready to checkout and I say, ""Yes."" She takes me to a self checkout and the girl scans my item, turns out its card only and I'm paying cash. #1.    She then takes the item to register 6 and I wait in line behind people that have an item with a partial tag and need to verify it. The checkout lady could have checked me thru while we waited several minutes to have a gentleman come out and verify the item. #2 As I'm in line the lady who originally got the item for me looks at me with a confused face, I tell her I was paying cash and she said come with me. Pulled me out of line to take me to a register thats closed and was not operational. No offense I've had enough. 40 mind for something I had in my hand in 10 is ridiculous. I was better off just going to the Abbott store, in and out in 10-15 minutes. Stellar service over there, Tudor not so much. Which is a big bummer because that's the big store with the inventory.
Simply put missed opportunities for excellence in service, devil's in the details."
10360,"Attentive staff, and the doc has the perfect pressure to realign what needs aligning."
10361,"Consistently the best cheese steaks in town. HooDoo cheese sauce is incredible and addicting. Really good, fresh salads. A bit pricey, but to be expected when the food is that good."
10362,"Waiting for my Lyft when the security guard with the long goatee came out shouting at me about walking about in the parking lot and happening near his truck in the parking lot.
Horrible customer service, especially as he knows I'm a paying customer.
I've had good experiences here before, but never been shouted at before today. Won't be returning."
10363,quality environment. very clean
10364,Gotta love the gear here...
10365,This place is AMAZINGGG! Tofu salad is a delicious and really filling vegetarian/Vegan option! Instantly one of my favorite places.
10366,"Great selection of jewelry, including some vintage pieces. The prices match the quality of the jewelry. This is not a place to go for cheap, but it is great if you want jewelry that will stand the test of time."
10367,Kratom price ? Can someone give me a heads up on where I might find this cheaper ?
10368,I normaly like asaina gardens food but today i just got the worst meal ive ever receved from them i couldent even eat it my s8 was a s7 the teriyaki chiken was the same texture as burnt rubber and the sweet n sour was probably on a warmer from noon till i got it at 730pm even the foam box has burn holes in it sorry but probably not going to order till i hear they start checking the food befor it gose out of the kitchen that was grose
10369,They did wonders to my daughter hair! Will definitely be back and will definitely recommend!!
10370,Scrumptious food
10371,Mediocre food
10372,Leaving I had alot of gas
10373,"Awesome place,, good coffee,gift shop is normal gift shop Prices"
10374,Was good
10375,"Terrific food! Burgers, chicken and malts! Yummy!!!"
10376,"Chevrolet of South Anchorage is a wonderful dealership to do business with.  Hart, our service advisor, is exceptional.  He truly understands the term ""customer service"" and goes above and beyond to make every experience a great one."
10377,Nice and clean place. You can depend on the staple meals at iHop. Good and fun food..
10378,Great place
10379,It's okayyyyyyy.... I use to shop at Sam's club but they got shut down... So by default Costco is the be only place to shop for bulk... If u have anxiety attacks or just hate being around alot of ppl.... This is not the place.... But food court is cheap but shopping there is a expensive
10380,"People - you have to take this ride of your life time.
Where on earth you can take train to no where. And people on railroad will flag it and it will stop to pick them up.
It’s a fascinating experience and on top of that - it is Alaska .
Last Flagstop service in wild Alaska.
You going be able to see the rural part of Alaska. The beauty around you and train will stop so you can take breathtaking pictures for your pleasure.
Lots of local using it stillget in town and back home, lots of hikers and backpackers use it to reach more wild tundra to explore.
It’s whole family friendly .
Do it! It is safe and very nice"
10381,ABSOLUTELY the best burger in town.  They are always busy so plan ahead for your food.  It is usually a 20 + minute wait but TOTALLY worth it.
10382,It was OK. Great service!
10383,Tied with Home Depot as the worst shopping experiences in Juneau.
10384,B&N is always a great place to spend some time browsing the latest books. I just purchased a 2019 road atlas there.
10385,"A good, though long train ride...giving you a feel of Alaskan pioneer history amidst the awesome mountains.  If you don't have much time, there are a variety of choices....eg being on the water, capturing the glaciers,  extensive hikes!
This was a nice excursion but I wouldn't repeat it, whereas the whale watching was awesome."
10386,It didn’t live up to expectations. Not horrible. Just not great either. The food was ok. The drinks were ok and the service was ok. Nothing was great but nothing was bad either.
10387,My favorite coffee stop! Where the Batistas always have a joviale attitude .The only eay to start the day!
10388,Nice spot to eat and have a beer where dogs can hangout.
10389,Good products with a nice selection of clearance stuff for bargain hunters.
10390,"Great food, beer, and courteous staff.  You can sit in, take out, or delivery.  Love this place."
10391,"My food was good, but there was long linrs and 2 of the things I wanted to order were not available."
10392,Good deli food and amazing sushi rolls
10393,"It's like Kriner's Diner, but without the breakfast options. But they make up for it with all of the topping options for burgers, multiple fry options, and a plethora of dipping sauces. If you have a sweet tooth, make sure to check out the pies!"
10394,My 4 year old and 1 year old love this place.  It is resondably priced especially on the days they run daily specials.  As an adult I wish I could play it all looks so fun!
10395,Fun and Helpful staff. Food is good but pricey. It's a cheap way to have some fun though
10396,Pure pleasure!  The food flavors are unique and they are satisfying to the palate. A Anchorage visit tradition.
10397,Enjoyed it very much had the bulgogi box was tasty
10398,"This place could be such a wonderful stop! It has all the components to draw folks to be here and want to come back. The food was good, the gift store interesting and the lady, Nina, running the place was nice. What made this place challenging was that Nina is pushy to buy food or charge you to take photos inside. She wasn't as warm in the beginning but became so with time. I would suggest that you still visit but be ready to say no to food and continue to talk to Nina."
10399,Had the yellow curry chicken.  It was delicious! The house soup was great too except the chicken in it was dry... go figure! I love the fresh roll. In Arizona they call them spring rolls and they're nearly twice as big. It was my first time and I got it to go. Next time I'll dine in.
10400,"(Translated by Google) Great place to stroll

10401,It's Mc'y D's
10402,Nice place with Rich heritage
10403,Great coffee and fantastic atmosphere.
10404,Nice quiet little shop. Staff is laid back. Customers are usually nice.
10405,Great
10406,Smiles for miles!!  Best spot in Anchorage!!
10407,Good food.
10408,"Crowded with cruisers, excellent nachos. Fun tour."
10409,"Got what I needed but a super sexist larger employee wanted to talk down to a woman. Acting like I'm dumb about windshield wipers. Then when what I said was what he looked up, acted like I was wrong."
10410,Really enjoy the Spicy Chicken Bucket and the other deals to be found here.. keep shopping and look for those yellow mark down tags.. deals are always to be found.. Happy Shopping and Saving
10411,"Best in ankorage for breakie, service was fine, perhaps little bit slow as busy ☺😀"
10412,"The vegan corn on the cob I had there was without a doubt the best corn on the cob I've ever laid my lips on, vegan or otherwise, so much so that I've dreamt about it since. Will be goin back for more, that's a promise"
10413,Lots of selection and friendly staff! Store is tightly laid out and can. E kind of hard to move around
10414,"Friendly staff, fairly priced!"
10415,"They get a 5 because the attendant always has the place clean and unlike other places in town, I've NEVER had an issue with any of their machines.  Anything not working has signs clearly marked.  They also exchanged a dollar that I did lose in one of the machines.  Very helpful."
10416,Outstanding food and the owner is friendly and cares. If you want the burger you can call ahead and reserve one. Do it.
10417,Very nice and helpful staff.
10418,Love it
10419,The whole place smells like feet. You'd be better off drinking under a bridge and listening to your phone speaker.
10420,Best views on a clear day. Worth the visit.
10421,This place was neat but I wouldn't have been heartbroken if I missed it. Nice art but the animal enclosures had some left to be desired. It was okay.
10422,The employees here are wonderful and a pleasure to do business with!
10423,"Disclaimer: we did take-out and cannot speak to wait staff or any other customer service. First off, the prices were high, $18 for Orange chicken in a container the size of a Panda Express 2 item entree, which is like $10. Secondly, the chow mein was literally the fried, crunchy chow mein noodles you can buy in the grocery store, just doused in sauce to make them soft. I'm not making this up. It was loaded with veggies and a portion of meat. All in all, not very impressed. I think the reason they get great reviews is because they are the only Chinese, or maybe any Asian, restaurant in town."
10424,"Beans and rice half the price of other Mexican restaurants in town. They are lightening fast. I barely get condiments and its done. Everything hot and delish, even when I take out and get home.
Have to change this review! We went last month and my sons nachos were absolutely burnt and the hot sauce looked like clear Thai sauce. He couldnt eat it of coarse. My Taco salad bowl was half full and I only asked for beans and rice. But a restaurant can have a bad day and we went back.  Sons tacos were completely different. Chicken meat smelled like dog food. It was not marinated. Just boiled chicken and completely covered in onions and cilantro. Two items he cannot eat. Threw it away and never going back."
10425,Good was horrible service was no better
10426,They do not carry a fairly standard size hole saw. Ended up having to go to their competition.
10427,Crazy busy and cluttered
10428,"The more Walmart continues to put IGAs out of business, the less I am becoming a fan."
10429,"Wowww!  Another gem of Seward not to be missed.  World-class sweets and treats, fantastic & friendly customer service. Best of all, Thai iced tea on tap!"

10431,"Fast, hot and just perfect for me today!"
10432,"Always have great service here. The technicians  go out of their way to explain issues, if there are any. Wouldn't go anywhere else. Great staff, always met with a smile.

UPDATE 9-22-2020
We purchased an extended warranty upon purchase of our truck. I'm totally impresses with the service we receive when we do have issues. My hats off to Mike Gardner, he has shown us that he indeed cares about the service received, staying on top of each matter addressed. Thanks Mike

Wanted to ad, was having an oil changed. Tech came back and said he noticed steering fluid under truck on gearbox. He went out of his way to locate the problem. Could of been a expensive problem if not caught early by Clyde the tech. My thanks to you for being a great service technician."
10433,"Wonderful. All day breakfast, quick, even when busy, and friendly."
10434,Find another place.
10435,"Usless as titts on a BUll.  Typical Union Hacks !!! My vehicle is parked in the garage as where most vehicles are parked. My insurance company uses this company, although not so sure after this. They REFUSED to tow my vehicle out of the garage !  I have just had shoulder surgery so I couldn't move it.  The driving had a Micky Mouse battery jump which did absolutely NOTHING. The second company came out, jumped the battery in 2 seconds and towed it away. They never told any anyone  before dispatching and not to mention I had to wait over an hour !!! I bet if I were having the vehicle repossessed, they would have gotten it out. They claimed: Union Rules. BS to me."
10436,Good food when it's to hot to cook.
10437,"You want quality service, friendly smile, someone to make you feel like your family... Well let Donna's staff and customer service make you feel that way...! From biscuits and gravy to French dip sandwiches... Top it off with the best milkshakes in all of juneau... We love it.. At least once a week we make it our priority to gather the whole family and head down there to eat there homemade pies with a scoop of ice cream.. The dinner menu is phenomenal.. The way the meals are served it's just excellent.. If you want good home cooking bring the whole family to enjoy the moment... You will not be disappointed..."
10438,"Friendly staff, hot food, and the best prices in town! Mozzarella sticks and cherry limeades are on point!! I never have to wait long for my order, and the employees are always smiling!"
10439,This is an awesome trail/ trail system.  Legal to hunt so be careful.
10440,Ice sculptures created by world champion ice artists!
10441,"They didn't have baked potatoes, chocolate frosties, ketchup, lids for cups, napkins, the list goes on. If they're not going out of business, they should...?"
10442,One of our favorite places to camp!
10443,Red bull smoothies a must
10444,Good place
10445,"They got my order wrong. Left an item out, it was to go and they gave it to me as dine in. When they packed it to go they left items I paid for out."
10446,Denali is one of the last places on earth with the abundance of wildlife and breathtaking scenry that is second to none. Denali is a bucketlist kind of experience.. come enjoy the finest of the arctic! Quaint village is invigorating during the summer months.. down home service and plenty of spots to aquire fine alaksa keepsakes. As a resident its our first outing every year. Cheers!❤
10447,Great service
10448,$2.50 for a can soda is way too much I'm not trying to pay your bills
10449,Fast friendly service and they catch ppl who steal
10450,"Had a fantastic time. Bears, sea lions, harbor seals, humpback whales, eagles. Saw it all. Great crew😀"
10451,Great desert place to hang with friends
10452,"Really great, everything is fresh all the time. Try the salmon spring roll, it’s neat."
10453,A bit overpriced but I love shopping here.
10454,Friendly folks
10455,Convenience and discount
10456,It was highly recommended but we weren't crazy about the soft crust. 35.00 for a lg. Pizza was a little steep
10457,What a great way to enjoy a warm and sunny Alaskan afternoon climbing around on the glacier.
10458,"Fun atmosphere, great coffee, limited food options, feel like more foods complimentary to coffee is needed."
10459,Delicious! ! An shocking surprise was their fantastic breakfast. ..delicious grits!! And I'm southern!
10460,Great food but seriously poor performance on the servers part. Sat and waited for 30 mins just for the check. Then waited another 10-15 mins just to pay it. I will not recommend this place to my passengers again.
10461,Hours could be improved upon.
10462,"Nice place nice selection of stuff
Cool glass friendly staff ;-)"
10463,The take home boxes are a real good deal
10464,Back Country. Few people. Seen Alaskan state trooper in a un marked Truck. Lots of Hiking and Boating. The Dragon Fly Size mosquito are no joke. Preparing for them is best not something you should get
10465,"Great ambiance. All healthy food; good for the soul, but not so good for the pocket book. $27 for egg sandwich, drink, and tip....for lunch."
10466,This location is okay because it's part of Safeway. Typically these locations don't have as good of customer service and they don't quite understand specially ordered drinks. Also the staff there seems to speak very openly about personal stuff and loudly at that including striking against the company that they work inside of. The drinks are pretty good as long as you order what's on the menu.
10467,Quick & always friendly
10468,Excellent burgers and shakes made from scratch
10469,Very calming place to sit and have tea and bakery items. They have so many varieties of dried teas to purchase. It makes blending your own easy.
10470,"Everyone there is awesome!! Doctors,Nurse and staff!! Very professional and pleasant!"
10471,"Really good place to stay, located in downtown's heart, you can do and go wherever you want from this point. Very centrical, even drugstore and natural stores are close by. If you are looking for excursions or activities, a few blocks from the hotel heading to the seaplanes locations, you will be able to find them."
10472,Iv been here 3years in that time they have gotten my order right one time.
10473,It took forever for a grilled cheese sandwich and a drink. I just left because I felt the order was lost. Filled up on chips at home.
10474,"Great food, great service. Will definitely visit again."
10475,"Delicious food, big portions!"
10476,Great place for pho and fried rice.
10477,"New, large grocery store with everything else you would need.  Great staff."
10478,"Relatively inexpensive food and a cozy atmosphere; I was sad to see the veg is straight out of a can and the baked potato had no chives, bacon bits, or sour cream served with it, though.."
10479,Great
10480,"Quick speedy drive thru, always correct order!"
10481,Beautiful
10482,Expensive but love that chicken & coleslaw!
10483,Great Lodge and good price point.  On grounds events are ok but a ride to Talkeetna isn't far.
10484,Had men try to get money from me. They got angry I wouldn't open my door or window with my child in the car. They have a security car driving around but they did nothing. Very disappointed Wal-Mart you need to fix this now! I will not return as I do not feel safe taking my family to the parking lot!
10485,Real quick service and excellent food.
10486,Good grocery store
10487,"Some prices are high, but I love their ethnic foods. They are my favorite store around here."
10488,"Great wood fired pizza, delicious handmade pasta. Get the pappardelle."
10489,Very Nice..
10490,"Friendly staff, awesome service. Doctor Lloyd and Weiss know what they are doing and are experts in the field. Office is always clean and they almost always have room for walk-ins."
10491,Decent self-wash car wash. I liked that it takes credit cards and has a setting to stop charging your card at $10 so you don't spend more accidentally.
10492,Pretty darn expensive. I would just got to the Orca if they are showing the same movie.
10493,Blizzards are good where ever you can find them.
10494,"The atmosphere is half the reason to go. The quirky building adds character to the experience, & the food is great"
10495,"Great crepes for lunch, dinner, or a sweet snack. And always fast friendly service"
10496,This place brings class to alaska👍
10497,Do not recommend. Staff was fairly friendly and the most positive aspect of this business. The salon is not very well aerated so fumes and chemical smell are quite strong. Pedicurist was very aggressive and actually cut the side of my big toe. I'm still having pain and redness two days later. If I hadn't applied neosporin it might've become infected.
10498,Good food and good service
10499,"Always hard working staff ready to answer and take care of everyone's needs, I really love taking my children here."
10500,Staff was very curious and pricing was fair
10501,"A lot of specialty items for a large grocery, and they know what the locals want -- things that are hard to get in Juneau like cheese imports and exotic fruit. The salad bar's good, I use it for lunch often, and the deli is exceptional -- the mole burritos & ribs are better than grocery store food has a right to be. Good seafood counter and frozen meats. Good Filipino food selection."
10502,"Absolutely amazing, super professional wizness, ie woman-owned business."
10503,"My family and I ordered here for the first time today. We got the beef bop and spicy pork bop, once my husband brought them home, my son wanted to try cause he heard us saying how good it tasted so he tried a bite and wouldnt give the beef bop back to his dad, so my husband made a second run and got the same order. Full bellies with happy smiles. Very good food. Amazing taste.  Will for sure order from here again. I took photos but dont know how to attach them to my review."
10504,"Homey atmosphere, meat cooked so tender you can cut it with a spoon, cornbread to die for, sides so good you want to ask for more. This small local business is friendly and welcoming and if you eat on the deck the view of the lake is wholesome and relaxing. Great place to visit!"
10505,"I asked for chicken chow mein with crunchy noodles. And they gave me this. I order from here all the time when I’m at work. And when I called. The manager got on the phone and started yelling at me. My co worker heard everything. And won’t send what I asked for or refund me. She says I can return it tomorrow. This is suppose to be my lunch. And I don’t get off of work until 7 am. I work in a hospital and I will for sure be telling my co workers not to deal with this place anymore. We order here all the time and the lady was incredibly mean.

Thank you china garden manager"
10506,Fantastic food and great prices. Friendly staff and fast service. Great for lunch or dinner and the horchata is on point.
10507,Great place to get many kinds of herbs
10508,Great beer and great food with helpful and enthusiastic staff
10509,Good food reasonable prices recommend
10510,Fresh seafoods
10511,What a GREAT place to pick-up a pair of Merrell shoes with Vibram soles! Awesome assistance from the sales associate and cashier!
10512,"I don't eat at Fridays often, I'm on the other side of town, but do enjoy their food.  I really enjoyed the service the other day when I was out with a difficult person to take orders for.  Cher the waitress and Don the GM did a great job of handling a difficult customer and did so with a great amount of tact and respect.  Thanks again!!"
10513,Too expensive
10514,This place is the nicest theater in Juneau.
10515,Good Access
10516,Everything is beautiful. The lack of five stars is from the homeless people everywhere. Especially late at night. Otherwise it has beautiful gardens and access to everything with setting downtown.
10517,Great great food...great great view.
10518,Food is good just a little pricey.
10519,"Beautiful hike to the top. Two trails, one difficult the other kinda rough. Watch out for wild life."
10520,Good place
10521,Best coffee ever
10522,Good food. Good memories.
10523,Pulling trucks out off the beach
10524,"The food is alright, but my battle buddy claims to have been given food poisoning from this defac. This is my main source of food all I can really afford as a soldier here on fort wainwright, it saddens me though the portions are always too small."
10525,Great service. The guys know there stuff. Also if they didnt have what i was looking for pointed me in the right direction to get it.
10526,"I enjoyed the honey fireweed flavor after a hike around Eklutna lake.  The workers are not friendly or welcoming though, so I had to mark it down for the service experience."
10527,Great meat department
10528,Highlight of the day
10529,"The food is mediocre. It's not the worst. But that is not why they get 1 star from me.

They robbed me, for almost nothing. The short female server with the short-ish haircut stole 2$ from me. I called in a pickup order. I came in when they said it would be ready. It wasn't ready. It was about 20 minutes late. When it was ready and sitting on the counter the lady saw it and tended to her tables and collected her tips before cashing me out. It was a little rude of her but everyone has a bad day. When she did get around to cashing me out she printed the receipt and handed it to me and said ""Can you 'fill' this out and sign it?"" I thought she was barking mad expecting a tip on not only a carry-out but a very late one at that. So I drew a line through the section with the tip and signed it. I didn't think I had to write more than that since I had my copy. Well the wife got the bank statement and she wrote in a 2$ tip for herself. We thought about calling the bank, but if they are willing to rob a local for 2$ then they will never get my business again. I'll save myself 2$ and eat somewhere else."
10530,Boo I hate this place so tacky and gross smells like old ppl
10531,"Great facility, updated electric scoring. The lanes seemed to have a heavy house oil pattern."
10532,Much better than any Taco Bell
10533,All the employees are doing a wonderful job and there is one for people wonderful people and they work hard and they are family to me and friends too.
10534,Not good at all
10535,"Always, great food and customer service. Bit less pricey than other downtown places, but doesnt lack on quality."
10536,"What kind of place is open, but doesn't deliver their items and has a minimum 20 dollar order, even if you live 10 minutes away? That's just bad business. Hard to see how this place is open since I've been a customer for years and yet I had all sorts of trouble just to update my online. I was willing to pay for my delivery, take that off as option if you can't even drop off a calzone down the street. I wish I could leave no stars, lost my business, for sure."
10537,LOVE LOVE LOVE this store! Great stuff at super prices AND friendly staff! I follow the Facebook page and got an elliptical for .10! Seriously for 10 cents!
10538,Great food and incredible service. Whole family was amazed. The house fried rice was my son's favorite.
10539,Love the guitar center.
10540,Good fast service!
10541,"Tried selling a car, instead got a story from a salesman. Told me he divorced his wife for his bf that stole $40k from him. 1/10 experience."
10542,It was a great time
10543,Nice decor and service.
10544,I love the compound
10545,Just not a lot to do here.  You have a restaurant and a grocery store but there's just not a lot of stuff inside
10546,"We disembarked here from our 7 day Alaskan Cruise with Celebrity Cruises to start our 5 day land tour and found the disembarkation process easy. First, the staff on the ship kept us informed until we had to leave and when we got off the ship ramp, there were buses labelled and waiting for us where the bus driver verified us and welcomed us."
10547,My son loves this place!
10548,"The waiters and food service have disappointed me about 4 times too many, last time I left because food took too long, and they expected me to accept Guinness in a can without a glass. Whatever explanation for poor food service and naive bartenders I won't bother with. I love Red Robin's I only go to the Tikahtnu location near base now, they always do great."
10549,We saw Northern Lights from this location. But I admit it wasn't the best spot.
10550,This is my favorite location. Great staff and always have everything on the menu.
10551,"Great food, but the service is a bit slow."
10552,"A moose! It was right there, below us as we strolled along the boardwalk! An amazing experience to be so close and watch such a majestic animal, go about its daily life below us. It was the perfect place to catch the sunset and a couple of the friendly locals were more than happy to point out birds or landmarks as we enjoyed our walk around the marsh"
10553,"Modern interior.  Large rooms though toilet area small, separate from shower which is good sized"
10554,"Was very good, great salsa"
10555,Great Burgers
10556,"Delicious and beautiful sushi, a little on the pricey side but well worth it."
10557,One of the better places in Kenai area.
10558,"I love this place! They are the absolute best, I wont go anywhere else for nails or pedicures, absolutely reccomend"
10559,This store just got everything you need for your garden. Very satisfied 👏
10560,Nice
10561,Loved it.  Breathtaking views w great narration of what you are seeing and what the gold rush was like over 100 years ago.
10562,Food was excellent. Never been let down by a hibachi place yet.
10563,"Authentic, in house mouthwatering dolmas and babaganoush"
10564,Anything you need for outdoor activities.
10565,Great place to go for a hike 😎👍🏽
10566,Good n quick
10567,Bouncy houses
10568,"Dine is is not for me, the christian music is not for me."
10569,Huge sports bar with TVs in the booths. Mary is such an amazing server!!
10570,"Waited over 30 minutes for a sandwich. Ordered a simple panini. No orders ahead of me, and had orders behind me made before mine. Didnt even give an apology for the wait."
10571,"I came on the first Sunday of the month which they call a Fast and Testimony meeting where members of the congregation bear their own testimonies of the Gospel of Jesus Christ during the first hour of meeting or sacrament meeting (they use bread and water). The environment was inviting, the people were welcoming, and an atmosphere of gratitude for the Savior was present. Meetings typically start at 9am, 11am, and 1pm and are held on Sundays."
10572,"I recommend this shop totally, very satisfied with the price and quality of their service!"
10573,"This store is my go to Asian grocery store. Has so many different varieties of produce & seafood. Their Chinese food is great, big plates filled with tons of food for a decent price."
10574,"Nice place, huge rooms that mimicked a nice apartment.  Fantastic!"
10575,"Great underestimated spenard spots , great burgers ,great pizza ,  awesome service and fast delivery is also ."
10576,"New, clean, but spendy"
10577,"10/09/2019 I went into this store to make a payment set my Iphone down and it was stolen.  I left it on the counter, five minutes later I returned to the store realizing I had left it there....the staff was no help at all.  I have been with the company for eight years, I will be switching my account.  Piss poor service, no offer to help, unable to pull and look at cameras in store... I will be taking all 5 lines from this provider.  The sales person who waited on us was more than eager to take our 375.00 payment but would not even give us the courtesy of help when she was told I left my phone on the table.  Patricia Ann Hole & Charles Hole"
10578,"Great sushi, I keep going back!"
10579,"The Turtle Club is the perfect place to take a date...The prices are reasonable, portions are Big for a Hungry Man or Family, if you can't eat it all, you can take it home in the doggie bag...There is a Bar and Two Big Dining Rooms, full bar and pooltables... Reservations are required and plenty of parking room...Enjoy a night out with that special person or wife and family-friendly as well..."
10580,The sea cares for no one.
10581,"Great pizza, very fast."
10582,"The Cape Fox Lodge restaurant (the Heen Kahidi Dining Room) offers some wonderful food, including delicious appetizers like the baked brie and crab dip. The prices are relatively high, however, and the service has been inconsistent at times. The lodge itself is beautiful, and there are exquisite, invaluable Native artifacts on display for anyone to view."
10583,Very friendly staff
10584,"Go there hungry, family style entrees."
10585,Food was good. It was just pricey and my server was not really taking care of us. Another server brought our food and another server refilled our drinks.
10586,Alaska aviation at its best
10587,"For fast food, they are great. Love there moonshine burger"
10588,"Staff grated me at the door and opened it for me as I walked in, super helpful if it's your first time or you can't make up your mind. Nice deals and prices on all their products."
10589,"Good prices, fun selection, if looking form farm/country/homestead feel perfect place!"
10590,"They have some awesome burgers here! Very satisfying, especially after a hard day of fishing!"
10591,They still let you smile in doors
10592,"The food is great! I had the Baja Steak Salad and my husband had the Buffalo Meatloaf Sandwich. The server, Kayla was pleasant and helpful when we were making our beer selection. We will definitely recommend this restaurant to friends headed to Anchorage."
10593,"Love, love, love the coffee shop"
10594,Like ice cream
10595,You can always find interesting things there
10596,Wonderfully quaint.  Good place to catch the lights in winter.
10597,"Smells like a toilet in ""north bar"". Here for a concert right this second. Over-hyped, the turn out is lame. Expensive drinks. People are relatively tame, although that could be attributed to the mosh waiver they make you sign. Probably won't come back."
10598,Always enjoy eating at the greatest restaurant in Kenai.
10599,Excellent wings!! Great crunch and flavor and service was awesome!!
10600,The manager Mike is helpful and the tall guy with the glasses is helpful to you but the guy neck is a prick hung up on me didn't order my part never called me back I work at a parts store I get it take my name number call me back no dial tone and didn't wear my part
10601,"Edit: the food used to be great, but now everything just tastes burned.

Great barbecue, friendly people. I always have a hard time deciding what to eat. French dip? Baby back ribs? Eastern spare ribs? Chip beef? Fish and farm combo? Catfish dinner? They are all so good! We always have to order fried okra and either fried mushrooms or fried zucchini too! Don't come here expecting fast service, most nights it's just Mike and his wife working the entire restaurant, but that bbq is worth the wait!"
10602,"Great customer service, renting a pavilion was so painless."
10603,Knowledgeable and friendly service department staff (J is the best for bikes).
10604,KC is great with pets who are nervous.
10605,Nice portions! Very tasty!
10606,I got the most unique photo!
10607,If you need it they probably have it and they have a knolage staff that's happy to help with anything you may have questions about.
10608,So good
10609,Very narrow aisles.
10610,Love the movie theater best seats
10611,"Best sushi house in town!
Ronnies is the only place I go"
10612,"Nice location, good shops."
10613,A conglomerate cares not for the people but the people's money.
10614,"Fantastic, especially after their recent remodel. Parking lot is funky though, but it's due to how the angled the building."
10615,"Great playground! Large area that is fenced in to help corral the kids. Two separate play areas for older and younger. Lots of things for them to do.

There is also a skate park adjacent. A campsite, toilets and a covered pavilion."
10616,Good coffee
10617,"I have been getting company logo wear pressed by them, which had been decent until I brought in garments that were printed crooked...comepletely crooked and off center. When I told them this isn’t okay with me they had told me that I already paid for it and they wouldn’t credit me even if i brought in my own brand new garments. Really disappointed....I’ll go do a much more professional company like Shirts up for honest and clean looking results"
10618,"(Translated by Google) Great food! One of the best dinners I've had in the region

(Original)
Otima comida! Um dos melhores jantares que tive na região"

10621,Great place and convenient!
10622,"This place is amazing!! They take wonderful care of my children!! The wait is never long and they are very thorough.  Staff is super friendly! We have been in for injury and illness, they were fantastic both times! Definitely bring your kiddos here!!"
10623,My goto vegan restaurant in Anchorage. You simply can not go wrong in this crazy good place!
10624,"Great view on the patio.  Can be a bit cold if the wind is blowin at all.  The heaters help a bit but they also offer blankets.  I love the selection of beers.  My favorite was the Double Shovel cider, but there were a lot of close seconds including the porter.  My wife and I shared a burger and pizza.  The food was great.  If you sit outside the food will cool a little quick.  Overall a great choice"
10625,"Food and beer were average, service sub par and prices high for my dishes, see pic of $28 fish and chips. Best pretzel I've ever had!"
10626,Best price and selection in Anchorage.
10627,"Wonderful staff! If have food allergies will accomadate...the salsa bar is super great, food is plentiful, prices low! Family friendly!"
10628,Good cut. Nice barber. No complaints.
10629,Typical McDonald's
10630,It's a decent store. They definitely put customer service and satisfaction first. They also offer a veterans discount.
10631,"Great food and I was so excited that the menu has food I can enjoy, even with food allergies. That is rare! I'm even more excited to learn they deliver now. Highly recommend."
10632,Beautiful day! Watch out for bears though...
10633,"I always feel like I'm getting a good honest deal when I go here. The staff are always very patient and knowledgeable when it comes to selecting the right cut of meat. And, if you want something amazing, get their marinated tri-tip. It is to die for!"
10634,Good soup and sandwich with fresh bread
10635,Awsome!
10636,"Parking kinda stinks, but otherwise a great experience"
10637,Beautiful campground with incredible views
10638,Nice place for a meal. Good food. Good service.

10641,Had a very informative tour
10642,Small but beautiful. Amazing place.
10643,What an amazing place! The hot springs make it worth the drive or flight!
10644,Nice clean place.
10645,One big rip off place stay away. You can find parts way cheaper then them rats.
10646,"I ordered the Battalion Po'boy and a dime size broken piece of jagged plastic was in my sandwich.  The manager decided to offer me another sandwich, which I declined as I don't want plastic in my diet.  I wanted my money back and was willing to bring the sandwich back,  but my offer was rejected in favor of Peppercini's offer of another sandwich, which is always prepared with something special the second time around. I did like the Battalion, just not with plastic."
10647,I always stop by here when I have a chance. The burgers are great. Pizza is awesome. Prices are very good. The restaurant is always clean and has very friendly staff
10648,Wish more people get to enjoy time it with their dogs.  Mine love it here.
10649,Went there to visit friends from stoney river . nice clean rooms and pleasant staff

10667,Great atmosphere and kind staff. Food is delicious and unique. Would recommend the Yukon Gold Pizza!
10668,Poor cleaning
10669,"This is not a real campground.  Just a loop of over 100 parking spots with numbers.  We stayed for day use.  There is a great small creek and sand for the kids to play in at the bottom of the hill before you get to the water.  You can drive down the hill if you have 4x4 but we walked.  Steep walk back up.  Be respectful to the dip netters setting up their nets on the sand.  Also, there are no clams here.  They’re all gone.  They dug them all up."
10670,"very willing to help, will try and get you anything your looking for and small businesses that take pride in what they do appeal to me! great job ak performace rv, thanks for filling the niche here in alaska!"

10679,"Really expensive pizza. Tastes good, but again, pretty pricey"
10680,"Love the customer service and prices, great value every time! The associates will always help you find what you need and the rewards program is actually rewarding!"
10681,"(Translated by Google) A luxury bookstore in Anchorage, where you can drink coffee.

(Original)
앵커리지에 남아 있는 고급서점,  커피도 마실 수 있는 곳."
10682,Nice place!
10683,I've  always enjoy eating here. Good food reasonably priced. You certainly won't find a better place for Mexican food.
10684,"(Translated by Google) A little sordid. The hotel is being renovated, the corridor on our floor was cluttered with mattresses, furniture, trolleys. Not very welcoming. Many homeless crackers in the hotel area

(Original)
Un peu sordide. L hôtel est en train d être rénové, le couloir de notre étage était encombré de matelas, meubles, chariots. Pas très accueillant. Nombreux SDF fumeurs de crack dans le quartier de l'hôtel"
10685,Have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The space is chill and the stylists are on their game. It’s definitely going to be my regular spot from now on when I’m in Anchorage.
10686,"My group and I were so glad we finally made it to Pangea. I've been wanting to visit almost as long as I've been in Anchorage. First off, the atmosphere when you enter is exciting and colorful, inviting and open. Our server welcomed us straight away. Service was great, but what struck me was how each dish looked like it was from real ingredients, used properly to create delicious meals. My Bellini was on point 👌🏻. I will definitely recommend and u will definitely return to Pangea."
10687,Hanging out with the family for the weekend.  Going to the Sea life Center. We came across this eatery. And to hear the kids talk about how the cook did an amazing job on their food was pretty cool. They are very picky eaters. The halibut fish and chips are truly the best I've had in my 25 year Alaska experience. They will see us on every visit.
10688,"I was eating there quite often for a while. Loved the banzai bowl and teriyaki chicken. Never had any issues other than a few veggies that were a bit weird/had blck spots but just recently ordered the bbq sandwich (teriyaki chicken, bbq sauce, tomato and lettuce) and was super grossed out. Got halfway through it and got a bite of something rotten. Didnt open it up to look at ot because I would have freaked out if I would have seen something gross so I just threw it away and went back to work. Never eating there again man that was nasty."
10689,"Gorgeous views of mountains & glaciers, tons of fireweed, and a spot to sit and have a picnic!"
10690,Good little store
10691,"Best fresh coffee I've ever tasted.great experience and they treat you like family,oh and the live band is a bonus!"
10692,Who doesn't like pizza?
10693,Really dirty from people feeding homeless and drunken homeless living in the woods nearby. Playground is nice though
10694,Food was only okay
10695,"A fun, interactive experience. The train ride is informative and the panning for gold is really fun. The staff there are helpful and friendly. One of the guys working there said he liked my monstercat snapback. Would recommend if you are in Fairbanks."
10696,Service great clean place will go again
10697,Fantastic people who are so helpful
10698,"Got food poisioning Horiffically rude wait staff, hands down the absolute worst food and experience I have ever endured at a restaurant. How the hell they are still in business is beyond me."
10699,Great place to get the gear you want or need!
10700,Great experience and lots of fun!
10701,They dont offer double cheeseburger meals according to my last visit. Had to buy dried out cold single cheeseburgers that were not very good. Guess I'll go to all the other McDonalds that do.
10702,Had an amazing server who was on top of her tables but I do not like how they do not us the landings menu up there anymore. Not at all a fan of beer battered fries.
10703,Great food and beer choices ! Get the fried pickles!
10704,Has everything.
10705,"Mostly prices and good inventory keep up,"
10706,"Purchased two guns here recently with smooth transactions from Sean and Sam. Yes, they don’t take CC or even debit cards and it’s strictly cash only purchases. I got over that and spent the $2.20 atm fee. Both guns were fairly priced under msrp. The $2.20 atm fee isn’t a deal breaker on a fairly priced gun. Especially if you can’t find the same gun elsewhere locally.  I’ll Support a local business and drop an extra $2.20 for an atm fee considering it’s cheaper than FFL transfer fees, taxes or shipping costs."
10707,Real easy hike to a great little falls.
10708,Not a bad bar
10709,Excellent food
10710,"Starbucks is always good!
I just purchased from Safeway Carrs Fairbanks Alaska location a cold ready made Starbucks jug! Delicious!"
10711,"As these usually do, they have great quality items without gouging you. Also, I wish I could take every animal home-..."
10712,"very nice, clean roo. and continental breakfast was very nice, fresh product, good coffee and well maintained buffet"
10713,"9-3-16, very good steak and halibut with asparagus and mashers. My wife had the grilled halibut which was excellent. Great beer and Aaron was a good server. Awesome view on the patio overlooking the chena river."
10714,Now...!  Marg.'s are great....time to come back in....   always been Great Food...!
10715,good place very nice ppls
10716,Order the double chicken on the after 9pm deals in the winter!!! It's only available during winter season but it's amazing!!! My girl and I eat here atleast two times a week... depending on weather....
10717,About what you expect for a neighborhood bar and grill
10718,Very Friendly
10719,The peaks of the Wrangell mountains are the best Alaska has to offer. I've spent my life traveling the world and the Wrangells always call to me.
10720,"A good night's rest. Not a run of the mill hotel. If you like eclectic as I do, you will enjoy this jem.
A towel rack and waste basket would have made this a strong 5 stars."
10721,There service was great we went before the rush to grab dinner. Food was really good we had the calamari and halibut fish and chips. Would definitely recommend this place.
10722,"Best cinnamon buns, and pastry in Alaska"
10723,Tiki marsala Friday lunch buffet is the best thing!
10724,"They had everything I needed to fix my acoustic guitar, excellent service."
10725,Great place to hang out!
10726,People that work here are very interested in keeping Alaska Natives healthy.
10727,"McDs is always the same, slow and boring."
10728,Good prices... friendly people
10729,"Has a pool, weight room, jacuzzi and sauna"
10730,"I stopped by with a friend who were being a difficult customer, I were impressed with the staff's patience. Kudos to them!"
10731,Delicious fresh baked treats and drinks using local ingredients. Also great variety in soup and lunch/Cafe offerings.
10732,Great food and the service is always super friendly!
10733,Great addition to Eagle River.
10734,Great food
10735,They always show up
10736,Pretty much just for cars/trucks...not RV with a boat trailer or anything super long.
10737,Best biscuits and gravy in town.
10738,They help people out tremendously
10739,This place could be awesome if they turned the ice skating rink into a work out center... I guess it's cool you cater to the 3% that ice skate while the rest of us cram into a tiny gym in -40°. Good call
10740,Great
10741,"The food was fantastic and the service was great. However one employee, Kyle who looked very unkempt and unprofessional I saw smoking weed behind the restaurant. Glad he wasn't our cook or our server!"
10742,I drive by this place almost everyday. Finally decided to drop in a few weeks ago. It was lovely. Service was amazing and the food was great. Will continue to come back.
10743,Not worth the wasted trip the people where have no idea what they are doing my advice go to the DMV not this place if you want get your I.d. or license changed to Alaska go to the DMV
10744,"I love this place! So cozy and great for meeting with friends, work meetings or even just to get some work done. Delicious coffee and food. Love how many options they have for food. Highly recommend!"
10745,Great place to meet friends in the bar or family in the dining room.  During warm days the patio is awesome.  Good food and full selection for a menu.
10746,Great food and good service.  Try something you have never had before.  I'll bet you love it.
10747,Staff was rude and impatient
10748,"Great place to get any kind of work done. I’ve done business with Pearson Auto twice and they are very professional and fair.
I’m very appreciative of my last visit; the bill was less than what was quoted.  A very good team of people at Pearson Auto."
10749,Lovely. Best in the morning in the winter after it snowed.
10750,Good convenient store
10751,"Really enjoyable spot. The coffee is awesome. The biscuits are OUT OF THIS WORLD. You can get biscuits alone, too, with butter and jam, which is really awesome if you're looking to build sandwiches to take out on a hike."
10752,Absolutely love the food and thar great people
10753,Stellar customer service.
10754,Service was great! Fast and friendly. Food was pretty good. Not the best red robin I have had but it was good.
10755,Super carb mainstay of Anchorage.
10756,"Great Special; Sandwich, New England Clam Chowder, pickled Cabbage, Breve and YUM Cookie.
Quaint, rustic, old town Kenai. A taste of old with new. It's a Go To place."
10757,Prices are really high!
10758,Just another starbucks
10759,Great selection of sporting goods at good prices. Staff is always friendly!
10760,Free to all.  Wonderful taxidermy. Ask at the front counter for the history of Maxine and Jesse.  GREAT 30 minute stop!
10761,Filled up before the trip to Anchorage. Had some coffee here too
10762,Excellent
10763,Nice place to vist but a little over priced. 2 Texas Gal's
10764,Great service.  Acceptable food for Mothers' Day brunch.
10765,"Nice hotel, slow wifi."
10766,"Upper O'Malley then Gasline toward Glen Alps - Very wide and well-worn trail also used by mountain bikes and horses in the summer.  At least for the first couple of miles there is almost no incline and it's completely straight ... More of a walk than a hike. No restrooms at trailhead and it's a small parking area. At this time of year, thick and tall vegetation on both sides of the trail, some wildflowers."
10767,Beautiful views
10768,Decent food and good service
10769,"Super friendly,  quick service, excellent food!!"
10770,My son and I freqquent this place quite often. The cashier guy is great ! He also makes you wear your mask 😷 so don't go there without it !
10771,"Staff always has the best interest for you, making sure you are aware of everything about your medicine. Sometimes things take a while to get to you when waiting in line, but other than that, I can always count on a warm welcome when I come in."
10772,"Easily the worst Starbucks in Anchorage. I've been here 3 times in the last 3 weeks hoping that they could get it right but they mess up a tall dark roast with sweet cream EVERY TIME! It's kind of impressive. I go through the drive through hoping they can get it right and when they inevitably screw it up then I go inside to have them fix it. Today our office manager went to get coffee and guess what  . . . they made her the wrong drinks. I understand that there are hundred, probably thousands of drinks sold each morning at this location but there are also 900 employees behind the counter and they are struggling."
10773,Food tasted better compared to other subways in the area.
10774,Friendly waiters and great sourdough pancakes. Reindeer sausage could be better.
10775,No wifi in the rooms but otherwise it's quite good
10776,Petco has always been our go-to shop for our dog's needs. We have never had a bad experience with Petco.
10777,"This is truly a full service, service station in every sense of the words."
10778,I thought it was very clean and the staff were friendly
10779,"If you're looking at saving a few bucks, but want to be near Denali, then this is the place to stay. Less expensive than anything closer to the tourist areas that are 15 minutes up the road. It's not the nicest place, but you're in Alaska, get over it"
10780,Great
10781,Beautifully tasting beers and incredible pizza. The salmon spread is delightful and the atmosphere is amazing. Would recommend. Thanks Rod Hancock!
10782,Great staff! Delicious food!
10783,"When paying with a card beware that they are charging you for your time in the wash bay, not only your wash time wash"
10784,"Very McD's like...not fast tho and fries seem to be old often as there out of shakes and ice cream every 3rd time I go.
Most employees nice 👍"
10785,So many Awesome and yummy things!!
10786,Just so beautiful
10787,"The best selection in the Valley, easy shopping experience and value."
10788,"Mixed reviews and feelings about the owner. Cheating his employees of pay. 3/4 million dollars awarded to employees by judge.
I will not support."
10789,50 minute wait. Overcooked hash browns. T-Bone on the tough side. Waitress was great though and saved the day !! 5 stars for the waitress !!
10790,Great staff good comfort food. Cozy environment.
10791,Love this place
10792,Nice place.to stretch your.legs
10793,Food quality sometimes varies but usually cashiers are friendly
10794,Great view.
10795,Great atmosphere!
10796,Got a medium meatlovers last night... wish i got a large instead! The staff are really nice and i love the pizza they make.
10797,Doing what's best for the community what's not to love
10798,Awesome food
10799,Crab.was.delicious!
10800,Helpfull slow
10801,Food was terrible don't waste your time or money. Bathrooms were disgusting
10802,Great place to start your Anchorage city tours. Lots of info and very helpful folks. Plus it is right in yheiddle of downtown.
10803,Fast service today and food ordered was very hot
10804,They were efficient and nice. I had a bill there for a long time. I will say I didn’t have any word about it at first and when they used to call me I guess the identification for their number was labeled unknown so I didn’t know it was them. Now their number shows and it’s all paid.
10805,"This is a fun place to shop. They have arts and crafts, gifts, bikes, skis, greeting cards, clothes and lots more. Their prices are ok for Alaska. The sales tax is high because they are on the Kenai Peninsula Borough and in the Soldotna city limits. Today, I bought a pair of slippers and saw a friend who was looking for a fuzzy boa to dress up her dog."
10806,"(Translated by Google) Stayed here for four days and felt a little sorry for such a high score. The accommodation itself belongs to the homestay, a more traditional house, and it is also very warm inside, so people feel comfortable when they go in. However, after living for a few days, I found a lot of problems: 1. The bed is a bunk bed, the ladder on the upper bunk is very difficult to climb, and because the mattress is too high, there is no protective measure around the bed; 2. Charging is very troublesome, the bed is not charged. The blanket can only be placed on the ground in the distance; 3. The blanket is too thin. The four people we live with include me. There are three people who have a cold. Although there is heating, it is very cold in the middle of the night and wake up in the morning, especially for colds. The location is too far from the city, there is a bus stop at the door, but it doesn't take 3 minutes to freeze. If you don't drive by yourself, it is not recommended. 5. The wooden house is especially badly soundproof and the sleep quality is not good. Be cautious, because there are people who come back in the middle of the night; 6. There is a kitchen, but it is very small, and breakfast has never been eaten.

(Original)
在这住了四天 感觉有点对不起这么高的评分。住宿本身属于民宿，比较传统的房子，里面也很温馨的感觉，让人进去就觉得很舒服。不过住了几天发现问题下不少：1.床位是上下铺，上铺的梯子很不好爬，并且因为床垫太高床的四周没有任何保护措施；2.充电很麻烦，床头没有充电的，只能放在远处的地上；3.毯子太薄，我们一起住的四个人包括我一个有三个人感冒，虽然有暖气，但是半夜和早上醒来还是很冷，特别容易感冒；4. 位置离市区太远，门口有公交车站很近，但这边冻透不需要3分钟，如果不自驾又是一个人的话不推荐住；5. 木房子隔音特别差，睡眠质量不好的慎重，因为这边旅游经常有人半夜回来；6. 有厨房，但是很小，早餐从来没吃过。"
10807,"Great food, wonderful staff definitely would go again. Only four star because I dont understand the theme In the restaurant it seems like a mix of a route 66 road house restaurant and a tropical theme. Overall wonderful place"
10808,Amazing food.
10809,"Nice variety of stores, friendly staff, and has a charming feel to it."
10810,Great place to run in the Spring or cross country ski in the winter.  Paths are wide enough for sharing with bikes.  You can explore the frozen ocean in the winter.
10811,Always good!!
10812,Wife loves it. Me not so much but Im not big on Sushi. It was decent though.
10813,Nice place to pickup fkshkng supplies
10814,Never again. Overpriced.
10815,I love that a I'm able to find all that I need from there
10816,If you're in the mood for a slice of pizza go to pizza hut on spenard and Minnesota Avenue in Anchorage Alaska. The staff was pleasant and the delivery was fast. I give them a five star.
10817,Everything I have ordered has been amazing and perfect.
10818,"Best beer, pizza, nachos, and salads in town!!!"
10819,"Love this bar, greats drinks, people, and bands on the weekends"
10820,Price match works every time
10821,"We went in for a normal boys cut for 2 of my sons.  All I said was longer on top and shorter on the side.  Pretty simple.  Both boys cuts weren't great, but one of my sons was absolutely horrible.  It was ridiculously choppy and he wound up with a Simple Jack look.  I brought him back for a redo and felt bad that another stylist had to spend her time fixing someone else's mistake, so I paid for the haircut again. She did better but it was pretty hard to make it look good after the original.  Usually the cuts aren't perfect, but theyre cheap and the app is convenient.  I guess I'll be switching."
10822,I haven't been here and almost 4 years cause the food was horrible  last time. Just went back yesterday and what a disappointing experience. My burger was cook well done and cole just not good the table was gross and ther was fruit flies flying around. How does a place with this much business still have earthquake damage walls. The waitress was not good only check on us one time. This place need a good cleaning.
10823,"we have been to  Home Depot twice in one week, and got what we wanted each time."
10824,"(Translated by Google) We loved it was our first time in the city, excellent customer service, family atmosphere and delicious food. The fried halibut was divine.

(Original)
Nos encanto era nuestra primera vez en la ciudad, excelente atencion al cliente, ambiente familiar y la comida deliciosa. El halibut frito estaba divino."
10825,Food and beer selection are good.
10826,Not a very safe campground where the garbage containers don't have proper locks!
10827,Much like all the other Three Bears stores.
10828,Great tasting food
10829,Half of the workers here are rude. Security is not good or nice. Drinks are overpriced and watered down.
10830,Good quality.
10831,"Ordered a blackened prime rib Caesar salad... got a Caesar salad and a skimpy prime rib, not blackened, on a plate with a plastic cup of jus sitting on top... pretty meager. Romaine was fresh and crisp, but Caesar dressing had little flavor."
10832,"Wonderful variety of choices on menu, delicious food,fine dining,fine drinks, attentive & professional staff, we've been dining there since 1979 and still one of the best restaurants in Alaska 🏔️🏞️."
10833,Great train ride
10834,"Unprofessional. Bad customer service. Didn't make my drink, then made the one I received incorrectly. Didn't really apologise or acknowledge me. Seems like more of a social hangout for the 5 baristas.

The sidewalks are not shoveled. Dangerous.

Too bad, because the place is gorgeous on the inside. Please train your staff and expect more of them.

We had the same issue at the airport Starbucks. Terrible drinks and bad customer service when it first opened. The owner hired all young brunettes with little care for quality of coffee or customer service training. Luckily they're finally starting to come around."
10835,Waiting since before 7:30 am for 45min so they can tell 70% of us in the line that we won't be served. Reason: they only want to do 13 cars a day. Terrible service and mediocre quality.
10836,Haven't been to Wendy's in a while but when I finally returned! I ordered their classic 1/4 burger with cheese! And it was good!👊
10837,Loved tubing so fun.. snowboarding was scary I might try again with training
10838,Amazing job gents thank you!
10839,Atmosphere was good and the staff was great.
10840,"Always low inventory they don't have simple things like a Webcam, or a wired Xbox controller. I only come for simple things but shelves are empty. must be closing soon"
10841,We love their fish tacos and they nachos. Service is always friendly and food is always good. The sampler is nice as well if you can't make up your mind on what finger foods you want.
10842,Friendly service jus takes forever but job is done perfectly & if U have problems U just have to go back & they'll check their work again
10843,"Since it is the closest to me now for laundry I go here. Very friendly staff and helpful. My service dog doesn't bother them like other laundry mat that have an issue with service animals. I do think that the prices are high to wash and dry. And there card reading machine is very slow, the whole card system is horribly slow that could use alot of improvement"
10844,Amazing and friendly service great atmosphere and phenomenal ice cream great place to go for a family outing
10845,"You enjoy the time singing and
praying to are Lord Jesus Christ it's awesome I love it"
10846,Love it good prices great location
10847,This Walmart is kept pretty clean and is centrally located on my side of town.
10848,"I have always had a good service when I come, they give me fast the foods all time, complete and tasteful food, the people who work there have always been very attentive, and many times they suggest combos or desserts when they want to help with the order, the place always  It has been clean and tidy, with napkins and cutlery always, and in general a good atmosphere."
10849,Gives me a stomach ache every time plus not as budget friendly as used to be
10850,"By God this place is amazing. Awesome coffee, awesome snacks, great customer service. I just ordered this on DoorDash and they were so accommodating and thoughtful in filling my order requests. They should give the barista a raise!"
10851,Chili was amazing
10852,Good quality car!
10853,Grate
10854,"It's a good little gas station, with friendly staff!"
10855,Pretty darn good.
10856,Best Asian food in town. Food has good flavor.  Very clean and friendly staff. Good Job.
10857,Not 24/7
10858,Small Costco compared to others but perfect for what it is!
10859,Good stuff
10860,Variety of stores and places to eat fun for the whole family
10861,Decent service and quick turnaround. Quality acceptable and clean premises.
10862,Friendly service and great workers.
10863,Surprisingly great zoo for being in Alaska. My girlfriend and I had a great time. If you find yourself in Anchorage it's worth the visit and ten bucks.
10864,"Great store!  Spendy, but has something for everyone."
10865,"This place is amazing, it has such amazing frozen yogurt,& it's soooo yummy too, especially in the hot summer time. They are so nice,& will try to get you whatever you want, or whould like. I think they even have a type of frozen yogurt for people who are sensitive to dairy products,& it's DELICIOUS. Summer is coming, so go try it, you WON'T REGRET IT. 😋😋😋😋😁😙😍💗💖❤💞👌👍"
10866,It's beautiful
10867,Had an Excellent meal here.. this place is great... The staff is friendly and our server was attentive to when we were close to needing refills a d table cleared.. Their Buffet service is bar far well worth the 5 Stars and I purchased 2 meals to go for my mother ... Great job
10868,Good hangout place
10869,Good service decent coffee good place to drop in to get your coffee fix
10870,I've worked with them several times. I've worked with Tom along in there and he's always been helpful and always trying to save me money as well. Questions from all about guns to shipping them to flying with them. Would recommend  to anyone.
10871,Nice falls by the road.  Didn't know there were trails.
10872,"Good food, good prices!"
10873,Nice friendly inviting good beer and food
10874,Very nice to go to somewhere so modern on first date.
10875,Its not bad
10876,"We were here to to eat dinner after a day of hiking. All three of us settled on having a burger ended up being ok, but nothing exciting. On the other hand, the fries were excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the facilities we're clean. We really like the atmosphere and would too stay sometime in the future."
10877,Great food and service
10878,Best burgers ever!!!
10879,"Great food, friendly staff. Perfect place to stop and break up the drive to Anchorage. Breakfast is huge, bring your appetite."
10880,Good food. Friendly staff.
10881,Helpful staff usually have what I need.
10882,best thai cuisine in town! highly recommend!
10883,They are right on target.
10884,"This place is awesome.  Huge Burgers, homemade onion rings.  My spouse and I usually split one of these delicious burgers as neither of us can eat a whole one.  If they are busy you may have wait for awhile for your food.  But it is worth the wait.  They are a little pricey, but again worth every penny.  They are the perfect reason to drive out to the Butte.  That is if they mountains, rivers, and reindeer aren't enough of a reason."
10885,I love their food!!
10886,Great place to deal with. CJ was quick to respond and helped us get setup quick and easy. Great location with easy access.

10936,Nothing out of the ordinary
10937,Good drinks great prices
10938,This is the place to stay for Aurora viewing. Very isolated and quiet place. Close to the Denali national park. Tons of complimentary stuff for breakfast.

10957,It's ok
10958,I pay for the monthly package and I go once or twice each week. This beats hand washing for sure and my ride stays fresh!
10959,"Menu is limited, and the online menu in our server's own words is ""completely out of date"".  Appetizers are best bet - truffle fries, fried olives are tasty.  Seasonal vegetables are OK.  Main dishes... Salmon overcooked on both occasions."
10960,"Amazing views! Food can be a bit hit or miss, but good overall."
10961,I love frontier outfitters.
10962,"Personally, I consider this to be the best pizza in Anchorage."
10963,Really nice toys a
10964,What’s more American than driving your lifted diesel pickup truck that gets 8 smiles per gallon to the drive thru to get that delicious cheeseburger and fries with a coke and a hot apple pie. You might be a communist if you don’t like those buttermilk chicken tenders with ranch. And don’t forget to get your kids a happy meal with a sweet toy they will prolly loose under the seat. ‘Merica!
10965,Could be cleaner and not so expensive.
10966,The frontdesk guy was discriminating against my nephew who i got the room for he also ignored us told me confirmstion code meant nothing to him. Then told another guest they dnt tajke deposits and told me i had to have one my bephew is 19 legal sge but he discriminated against his age.i had to wait for deposit for a while cause they really dont take deposits WHAT.!!!!!
10967,A good place to get out and enjoy the views of turnagain arm..the mountains are beautiful on a clear day :)
10968,Food ok. Takes long for you to get your food.
10969,"Always a pretty calm atmosphere, except for the people yelling at you to come eat at their joint in the food court 😂"
10970,Best burgers! Great customer service 👍
10971,It has been a long year but eating here again is like none of the bad things ever happened! The staff is on point! The food is AMAZING! Pus the environment is warm and welcoming as it's always been!

10979,Decent food could be better but overall really good
10980,When I feel like treating myself I come here for their chocolate milkshakes. Convenient location and they have a lot of options on their menu. They also have a porch with picnic tables.
10981,Best pizza in the Valley!
10982,It does the job
10983,"Personal I'd rather wait 1-2 more mins for fresh made food,  personally dislike the taste of the foods, and the waste. The make 6 sell 2 burgers( 4-5 mins) the food is thrown in the garbage. French fries and ice cream are good"
10984,They take great care of my dog at an excellent price. Everyone who works there is very professional. And are great about answering all my questions.
10985,They had what my boyfriend needed. So yay!
10986,"I always stop by for everyone's favorite dip and cigarettes on my way back from visiting with family. We will all continue to shop at Tobacco Distress for the attention to detail, the friendliness and care. I have a child with severe food allergies, you might be thinking,
""Why does this matter for a tobacco shop?!""
They used to hand out tootsie pops for the kids. I always had to decline, because of my allergen kiddo. Well, they now carry an allergen friendly lollipop that my kiddo CAN have and that seemingly minor detail, means the world to my family (there are A LOT of us, spread from Nikiski, Kenai, Soldotna, Sterling, Chugiak, Wasilla and Big Lake!) and kiddos. A seemingly simple thing that makes us all say THANK YOU and recomend EVERYONE do their Tobacco business at Tobacco Distress."
10987,Go to Cold Stone instead. This ice cream was so bland and didn't have a creamy texture. No vegan options unless you want a sorbet.
10988,Was fast and friendly
10989,"Great food, love the outdoor patio, $3 oysters. Hard not to love the place."
10990,"Excellent service, really nice guys behind the counter. The seating area's a little bland, though."
10991,"I LOVE this place. I went here for the first time in October 2019, and have been hooked ever since. The pho is amazing, and the service is great. I hadn't had pho before, and the server happily walked me through how to enjoy my meal."
10992,Great staff.
10993,This place is a great place to take you're family to.
10994,Best bathtubs in town!
10995,Excellent selection and knowledgable staff.  Always running great sales.  Growler bar too.  They've got three locations but Klatt is my favorite.
10996,Excellent pizza and beer
10997,"Open 24/7, great hot drinks and donuts for that graveyard shift"
10998,Great service staff and free coffee and cookies how is to complain
10999,"Drive-thru was fast and order was right, just seems like Taco Bell is putting less meat and cheese on there nachos, and finding out they no longer have the grilled stuffed burrito on the menu was a dissapointment."
11000,Beer food excellent!
11001,"Lines are always sooo long. And no plastic bags.
Idk I’ll go up the road I think."
11002,Reliable fresh food.
11003,Best burger in Kenai!

11006,Love the slushies#onlyReasonIGo
11007,Quick fast service was greeted with a smile the food was excellent warm
11008,Beautiful place with a rich history and plenty of photo opportunities
11009,We stayed in our camp site for 3 days n enjoyed it! The staff was great n I was glad to use the showers there also!
11010,"First pros: friendly staff lovely rooms great location. Cons: No room service and the staff have no idea about it. We called three different places starting from the food service number listed in the hotel directory. Second, they have window mounted AC units. This would not have been a problem except in summer blackout curtains are a must. This rendered the ac unit ineffective. Causing it to be on all night and not cool the room at all. The hotel itself is very warm, (understandably so) but the AC unit will only work with the curtains wide open. I would definitely stay in the winter though, and the airplanes are not too loud considering how close to the airport it is."
11011,"Fantastic place. Great (and unique) food, great people, relatively quick, and a really nice setting to eat at. Will be back for sure."
11012,Its KFC what's not to like !
11013,"Beautiful place, might return if there was a management make-over.  Love Princess will continue traveling with them elsewhere.  This place was very unprincess like."
11014,Everything you look for in a Costco
11015,Fast and efficient.
11016,"His prices are too good, he can't keep product in stock lol"
11017,I needed a new four wheel drive SUV when I got off the plane in Anchorage. Glenn and John and Matt at Kendall Ford got me the right vehicle and I was on the road in just a few hours! Thanks guys!
11018,Good coffee
11019,"Small place sweet view of the sunset, cool deck, watch the Chena River flow by"
11020,"The food I purchased, was amazing and cooked to my tasteful appetite! Thank you for great customer service also."
11021,"If you want pizza and a beer and watch a good movie, This Is The Place To Go."
11022,Pretty fun times.
11023,Its ok
11024,Yum... had a white mocha...  staff was friendly and fast!!
11025,Inexpensive most of the time and open late. Great for those quick stops.
11026,nice  scenic spot on the way to Denali
11027,Good buffet.
11028,I did not go in! And it's kinda hard to find the parking lot and the front door.  Also The people that work there seem to be unfriendly!
11029,"If I don't remember things, than it was good because nothing bad happened."
11030,Modern bar that was pretty busy. They looked like they were a bit short staffed for a while. The only bartender did a good job being friendly and trying to get everyone drinks. They had someone join him after a bit which helped a lot. There are more bartenders on the pool table side if you are in a hurry for a drink.
11031,Lots of things on the menu for both meals and snacks as well as drinks. The seating is currently outside but who wouldn’t want to sit outside on a beautiful day. The fish and chips are a staple that was done well. There’s a small bar inside with fun interior decorations.
11032,Very helpful staff
11033,Best italian food in Anchorage!!
11034,Had our order ready to pickup helped unload 8 cores and load 8 new golf car batteries!!
11035,"We stopped in for a frosty to celebrate my little one's birthday early and when the manager made the rounds to check on everyone, I mentioned we were celebrating her 2nd birthday. So, she brought over a kids toy for her. Very kind. The restaurant was clean and the food was good. We will be back to this location."
11036,Nice local shop and they didn't price gouge me like the others in town.  Best prices I could find and work was completed satisfactorily.
11037,Yeah!
11038,"Some of the most kind hearted people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing! Amazing quality of care. Knowledgeable, informative providers. I personally see Rachel Coleman, PA-C, and I trust her with my life. She is fantastic. Every single person in this office dedicates their time to doing whatever they can to helping their patients. Whether it be a refill request, answering a phone call, sending a referral, I have never been let down. I would recommend this office to anyone."
11039,Great steak and lots of rewards
11040,All you can eat buffet. Food is good and never out too long.
11041,"Excellent service, quality and details."
11042,"Very friendly, great with getting to-go orders ready, and always safety first."
11043,People were very friendly. Sandwich was not desirable at all. And the scones were so dry that I actually threw them out. Have had better other times. But this time was terrible.
11044,"I love love love their gellato! It's super delicious, and they let you put up to four flavors in one cup- a big plus since I like to have variety and try new things! Prices are pretty good too, but I still recommend checking prices in other cafes simply because I'm a bit lazy with comparing prices. The staff are quite nice as well- I always feel good walking into their store!"
11045,You want your clothes clean and folded? Like day's of old... It's the best!
11046,Employees were friendly but the people just hanging outside begging for money and approaching my 13 year was obnoxious.
11047,"Numerous examples of a poorly run place, but the best was someone had blocked me in from leaving. The person (seemingly in their own vehicle) was talking to an employee. They were laughing and carrying on with one another, all while I waited to leave. Then, the person gets out of their vehicle and walks away. And it's not as though they had just blocked me into a parking spot, but rather I was pulling around from the back of the building to leave and had to stop for them. More than one employee was in view of all this and said nothing that they may want to move their vehicle and not block the exit. It's a really tight lot to begin with. Not once did I have a positive experience going to this place."
11048,Did t like the salesmen
11049,Resolved my vehicle issue Damon Avery-Hess was very professional
11050,Easy to get help when I needed it!
11051,It's ok
11052,Not what it used to be
11053,"Great food at affordable prices, most plates $10 to $15"
11054,"Last time I was there the system double charged me, causing me to be charged for an overdraft fee, wouldn't do anything about it saying that since it already went through that it was beyond them and I needed to go through my bank. I was not the only person who this happened to"
11055,Good place to walk good place to see ducks and geese
11056,No moose but moose sign.
11057,"Bored staff who were phoning it in.  I had the Reuben panini.  Soggy on one side, dried out on the other.  No sauerkraut.  1000 island dressing dripping off one half, nonexistent on the other.  My husband ordered the rockfish platter.  It arrived to the table six minutes after I got my sandwich.  $16 for about 3 ounces of fish on a pitiful bun with one piece of lettuce and one slice of tomato, stale potato chips and a side of mayo with speckles of what might have been herbs but had no flavor to distinguish them.  Very disappointing for an over priced meal in what is a charming location with a beautiful view."
11058,"Has what you need. Nice view, parking lot, and toilets."
11059,Pizza was hot and correct AND the delivery even came early. Will I order again? Hell yes. This was my first time ordering from this location and I'm pleasantly surprised.
11060,The staff was very helpful. I couldn't find everything I needed. The store is kind of weirdly organized but the staff there helped me find everything I needed.
11061,"Very tasty! Efficient, friendly service. Much healthier than most fast food. I like this location better than the midtown location."
11062,Very good coffee and  food
11063,"I originally gave The Landing Hotel a 4-star review.  But the GM reached out to me, I mean, THAT is service.  I have edited my original post to a 5-star review."
11064,"My son was too shy to let the barber know his type of hair style he liked. And we made a reservation and was seen way later after I mentioned it. So we will go back, but going to express how we'd like to style his hair with a picture, they asked for. Very nice and uplifting experience."
11065,Love this mailbox place when bug post office is closed
11066,They are very friendly and so helpfulI to my elderly mother. They help with any phone or iPad issue she has. They dont talk down to her. Great customer service!!!!
11067,This is a great resource for your gardening hobbies. Definitely check them out!
11068,Clean and friendly. Great artists.
11069,"I have visited obsession records three times at the most. When I drop off the cds. Steve goes through them and pays me for what he wants. I usually end up bringing some home. He said some he can use and some cannot use.. ( I do not know which music genres he is looking for, but...)"
11070,"Long wait for a table, but it's a great place to eat."
11071,"Fantastic sea food and plenty of local beer on tap.

Get there as soon as it opens, it fills up quick as it is popular with tourists and locals alike."
11072,"This Walmart is very large and has plenty selection, however I find that the diversity in ethnic products is lacking. Example, I enjoy Goya products and I was not able to find this  rand at this Walmart. Furthermore, the prices are sometimes still marked as if you were to buy the item in the lower 48 states and when you walk up to pay for the item it is a higher price."
11073,"This place is awesome they have amazing prices and super friendly staff!! The product is top quality, my favorite part of the place is they always have better prices than anyone in town and still have super deals everyday!!"
11074,"I had a wonderful experience storing my belongings at this storage yard. Their system for ensuring stored belongings remain safe is very efficient and, true to their name, secure. I had the pleasure of working with a gentleman named Vic who was very kind, professional and extremely helpful. They are honest and very friendly. I recommend this storage company to anyone seeking storage in the Mat-Su Valley."
11075,Slow getting food
11076,Tons of inflatable fun!
11077,"Old style restaurant older crowd, step back in time."
11078,Old fashioned toys.  Intelligent toys.
11079,"Great equipment!
Kids always have a blast on the spinning sphere"
11080,"Good service, nice staff"
11081,"Service on the deck was a tiny bit slow, but good food. Waitress dropped one of the chicken strips from my friend’s meal and did nothing about it."
11082,Get your order right half the time
11083,Best Korean restaurant in the valley.
11084,food and beer 🍻 are always good. can't complain
11085,Really great food. The portions are enormous. The pancakes are the best in town.
11086,Comfy coffeehouse with good food.  A nice place for coffee or a sandwich!
11087,"Best service, AMAZZZZZING food,. Great hospitality for my 7th time here each year"
11088,"The first time I used Flat On The Spot, I got 2 new tires on my car. Jason not only helped me get the right tires but made sure I wasn't over paying.  A few months later, my car broke down and Jason came to my house to fix it. It wasn't easy either, but Jason went above and beyond to get the right parts and everything installed to ensure my car was running again.
Now I own a new car and being a single mom and small business owner, I don't have a lot of time and definitely don't have any mechanical knowledge- I've joined their VIP program so now I have nothing to worry about. One of their mechancs comes to ME and checks on my car every month! Plus I get free oil changes and loads of other discounts. Honestly this is a God send. I can't be with out a car.  Thank you!"
11089,"Small and has a limited stock, but for the area it's good for what it does."
11090,"I think the price of $140 per person is outrageous.  The views of the glacier are nice and that's the only thing you can't see else where. The ride was 6 hours too long.    I have seen seals, otters and whales else where.   It cost me 840.00 for 6 adults.  Last year I paid 930.00 to cruise Boston to Bermuda for a week for 2 in October. Unless you need to see a glacier 100 yards away spend your time and money else where."
11091,"Last year (2017) my wife and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here at the Girdwood Brewing Company.  This year (2018) we returned to celebrate our anniversary with a tasting of the light beers.  My wife loved the ""dysFunktional"" because it tastes like a tart grapefruit.  I'm more of a dark beer kind of guy, but I liked the Down the Chute.  If you're looking for a place to relax with friends and family then you need to visit the Girdwood Brewing Company."
11092,Ok
11093,Had a amazing vanilla white mocha
11094,Beautiful
11095,I love to go in this store and just look at the pets
11096,"I almost don't want to review this place so I can keep it to myself!  What a GREAT place!  The sushi is fresh and wonderful and amazingly fast.  The Yakitori is amazing.  The BEST we had was the beef tounge, REALLY!  Outstanding service and very, very frinedly.  Ok, now I want to go there for lunch!"

11102,The prime rib was awesome!!
11103,Anchorage's best non-greasy greasy spoon.  Locally owned and operated.  Great breakfast place.
11104,Nice to have a tasting room atmosphere and food available inside. Nice crowd and staff too. Prices are decent. I would give 5 stars if I liked the IPAs more. They were just ok.
11105,"Don't do much business there any more. Was gonna buy a hot water heater electric to kid told me there not on the floor, will there on the shelf there he look up the price and he could find it so he told me there not for sale until there priced. Needed 4 of them for a job i said i will just by them at Lowe's. Idiot could of ask a manerger for price."
11106,"Answered the phone and quick response to a residential lockout.  Lock was damaged and could not be picked, but je knew just the right way to break it so the fix was cheap.  Reasonable cost with no upselling.  Wpuld use them again."
11107,Staff is so nice! Quick oil change and knowledgeable staff very kind to myself and my bf.
11108,It was a good lunch choice . Food was fresh.  Long standing local spot. Outside patio dining  next to creek.
11109,Good food an service
11110,Things are looking up at the new Edgewater Inn. One of the best views in town. Their limited menu was tasty!
11111,This place is the definition of Christmas store! Santa is very funny and great with the kids. Make sure to check the reindeer out next door too!
11112,Breathtaking views!
11113,They have really great burgers here!

11147,Great place to eat! Family friendly
11148,"This was the highlight of my summer in Alaska!  We did the 7.5 hour wildlife cruise and it was amazing!  We saw eagles, sea otters, a mountain goat, sea lions, humpback whales, and puffins.  But the best part was seeing and hearing several calving glaciers!  The 2nd best part was drinking a margarita made from a fresh iceberg!  The buffet served onboard was delicious.  The narration provided during the cruise was great.  Was a great overall operation and would definitely do this again!"

11153,Knowledgeable staff
11154,Best breakfast food in Kenai.
11155,Ok sales sometimes
11156,Waited in drive thru such long time. Could hear that 4 different employees were on speaker taking orders. The 4th person finally got orders correct and fast. Bad place for drive thru entrance had to be on Dimond road blocking traffic horrible.
11157,Contemporary Harborview seafood dining.
11158,Good

11162,The service was good and the food was very good.
11163,Best sunsets

11165,"Been here twice now.  The service is spotty, however the food is consistent and good.  We enjoyed the fish and chips both times.  Lively atmosphere with tons of TV'S to watch the games."

11170,We were searching for a new gas stove and Hannah Raymond helped us find exactly what we were looking for....
11171,Found the product item which I needed. Employee was friendly and very helpful.
11172,Local hang out spot
11173,Cold(20°F feels like 3°F) and windy(30+ MPH/50 KPH) with deep snow drifts when I hiked up. Beautiful views. Google won't let me post the video so you will have to go see for yourself.
11174,Nice inside but very sketchy hill
11175,Great staff and we'll stocked.

11184,Really liked there selection.
11185,It's a nice park with two different play structures and a couple swings. They have a nice covered picnic table area and trash. I didn't see a bathroom but I didn't walk all the way around. It's a wood chip park and the toys are dated but still fun.
11186,"Very good food, great service, and respectable bloody Mary's!"

11188,Wish the prices were better

11193,"Not only the best pizza in Alaska, but the best pizza I've ever eaten and I've lived all over!! Crust is thin and crispy toppings perfectly cooked, the whole pizza looks and tastes like a fantastic masterpiece each and every time I get one. 12/10 could not recommend more."
11194,Can't beat Carl's for the best of the affordable fast food places.
11195,"Rude server, awesome view"
11196,Amazing like always! Waffle cone is mandatory!
11197,I had the halibut Chipotle and it tasted amazing. The only problem is now my stomach is upset and I don't know if it was the food or something else
11198,Food was very good and the service was excellent.
11199,"Best bowling alley in town. The staff are friendly. I have not used the bathrooms so I can't comment on them, but I always have a blast when I visit."
11200,"Potter's Marsh isn't only a bird sanctuary, it's also a people sanctuary. This is a great place to take visitors or just a nice stop for locals who want to take a break from the highway. In the winter you can often skate here, in the fall look for swans, and in the summer pick some wild sweet gale."
11201,We walked on this trail.
11202,Nice bike trails and amazing views.
11203,The best little sammich shop in all of Anchorage hands down.  Courteous folks and safe ordering with all the Covid mess.  Recommended.
11204,"Spent an hour and a half in line for nothing, couldn't find the package 🤬."
11205,"The Manager.  Who were, at the Costumer Service desk. Give me a VERY, GOOD AND PROFESSIONAL,  WAY. HE DID HELP, ME. TAKING TIME, LOOKING, FOR SOME INFORMATION.  THANKS."
11206,Awesome food and coffee
11207,Had some burgers and WiFi there. Quite good.
11208,A fun place with a group. Very different than anywhere else in town.
11209,"Prepare to feel like a burden to the staff at this location. They will do their job, but don't expect them to be friendly in the process."
11210,"Friendly staff, easy scheduling and great care. Dr. Gurr took the time to explain to me what was going on with my problem tooth and he offered a good solution with a next-day follow up."
11211,"After eating here with my daughter for dinner, she threw up all night.  Luckily for me I didn't throw up, I just sat on the toilet the entire next day, thank god I had a sick day to use."
11212,They had what I needed and were open
11213,"Easy to use, can go through the automatic side or the do it yourself. Has    at least five different cleaning potions to choose from."
11214,Nice clothes
11215,"The two-hour snowmobile tour was SPECTACULAR! Beautiful scenery and four moose. We also had a great time ice fishing. Rod, Jr and Aaron were outstanding guides and hosts! 12th trip to Alaska. Rod's is HIGHLY recommended!"
11216,Must go place for repairs or purchase.
11217,"They're new burritos are amazing. If you have to eat on the go, get your food here. Girls are sweet too."
11218,Very knowlegable staff and a great way to see the animals up close!
11219,"Food was good, the server was nice but the food took forever to be served. Gluten-free friendly.

The bottom floor is open seating and we were able to find a spot there quickly. The indoor and outdoor seating on the upper floors had a wait at dinner time.

The yak burger was flavorful but also dry, and the salmon burger tasted great, but the quantity was less."
11220,"Great atmosphere with the nice food options.
Chowder was perfect, it was creamy and best one I have ever tasted."
11221,Older building but very clean. Staff friendly.  Best prices around for washing king sized quilts.
11222,"Menu items are pricey, as expected for a downtown restaurant. Food quality is great!"
11223,It’s got trees
11224,Not that great. Not much selection
11225,Nice room close to harbor. Trendy dining available within walking distance. Rooms have no air conditioning. Fans available in rooms.
11226,"Once again a order was placed on it was screwed up. I ordered wings and they weren't even put on the ticket. Every time I expect a screw up I just wonder what it is.
Horrible service!
Totally inconsiderate manager. When the video games are not working don't lie to me and tell me they are fixed! Zero stars would be appropriate."
11227,Good coffee!
11228,Staff was very attentive and helpful with picking out skis. I found a decent pair for a decent price and I would recommend going back. They also give fairly decent credit for some items on in store credit. Yay
11229,"After a slight accident, Wasilla Family Auto was so very helpful and timely in ordering and replacing the tie rods for our tire. Very friendly and fast service!"
11230,They messed up two orders while I waited for mine (my order was correct). Their skinny fries are akin to shoestring fries from the grocery store. The burgers I received were overcooked and dry and overall not impressive or special. Only reason the review is 3 starts is because I only went once so I am not sure if this is the norm and do not plan on going again.
11231,Nice views
11232,Best food and best place to stay hands down.
11233,"The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about what they do. The dogs are super friendly and it's free!"
11234,Awesome movie! Awesome pizza! Awesome beer!
11235,"Went in to Zushi tonight and immediately noticed how much nicer the restaurant was. It had a stellar atmosphere. You could quickly tell something had changed. Upon meeting the owner who was courteous, polite and efficient. We found that ownership had changed.  The change was clearly for the better. Everything from the flavored water, homemade soy, and top tier quality sushi. I was extremely impressed with how beautiful the dishes were presented. The flavor encompassed the perfect blend of seasonings and fish. This sushi restaurant is great looking and it seems all aspects have been addressed to include wonderful decorations and unique cutlery. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone who wants to have a quality meal at an affordable price. The sushi was by far the best we have had in the Matsu valley. We will be visiting this location more often.  Bonus also that they recognize our military present and past offering a discount which most fine dining restaurants do not."
11236,"Good food, service, and price. How is it Golden Corral can provide food at a normal price, yet every other restaurant is through the roof expensive. Best deal in Anchorage"
11237,"Actually pretty great, food was great, service was great!! We went way back when they first opened and never came back because we did not have the patience towait for the food. The food arrived quickly & hot... loved it!!"
11238,Good food. Fast service
11239,They have a lot of what you need. Service is pretty good.
11240,Thanks for letting me use the bathroom 😄
11241,Yummy
11242,Good alternative
11243,Autozone has to be my favorite place to shop for parts. Spend $20 5 times get $20 free to spend. Awesome
11244,Love the scenary
11245,"Second time visiting Alaska. This place is always a must.  The last photo is a pic of grandson while visiting from KY. SANTA'S HOUSE WAS CLOSED IN JANUARY, 2018. HE KEPT KNOCKING SAYING,  ""SANTA LET ME IN! PLEASE?!) We had him so excited about seeing SANTA."
11246,Better ingredients. Better pizza!
11247,Excellent food and great service. The lemon meringue pie is amazing.
11248,Everything has flavor and the service is excellent. I recommend the avocado fries and and ipa.
11249,"So we went there after I got off work and they told us they had to make us fresh potatoes for the Fiesta potatoes I ordered and took a really long time. When we left we found out that they actually were holding us because they ""smelled alcohol from our vehicle"" and they called the cops on us. We all haven't drank alcohol in months and definitely didn't have any alcohol on us. So we got to eat cold food for having to wait so long... thanks taco bell!"
11250,Good people
11251,Bingo is bingo!!!
11252,Service are awesome.
11253,Beautiful
11254,You wouldn't believe it but they have paint!
11255,This place was neat but I wouldn't have been heartbroken if I missed it. Nice art but the animal enclosures had some left to be desired. It was okay.
11256,A touch spendy for what you get. The food quality is excellent though.
11257,Nice fresh fish forbpurchase at a decent price!!
11258,Very nice breakfast!
11259,"Wings were good and fries were very good.  Clean place with good service.  HOWEVER, you charge me for a side of ranch??  This is a wing place.  That’s absolutely insane!!"
11260,"What's in the burgers, great employees"
11261,Food is delicious. Dine in open til 10p. Drive thru open till 12 mid.
11262,Great inexpensive Hawaiian-Japanese fusion
11263,The best place I like in anchorage is very clean hotel
11264,Definitely not anchorage's pride. Location is fine but the variety of stores kinda lame. . and what is it gonna be now that Sears is closing?
11265,"Delicious  pancakes, and breakfast  plates!"
11266,Always have an excellent experience.
11267,"Just had a great experience with American Tire & Auto. The tire pressure light was on for my moms car and she didnt listen to me that it was just the cold, -10 degree farenheit, weather. So they not only filled the tires with some air but they also did a check of the tires to verify that there was no puncture, causing a slow leak. We were on and out very quick, very cheap and very satisfied."
11268,Service was great food was good but not spectacular.
11269,They was rude one of the owners sons wanted to fight with me
11270,The salesman bent over backwards to find us a refrigerator
11271,Pretty easy to get your recycling done fast here. I wish they accepted more plastics other than #1 and #2.
11272,"Good place to shop, great pharmacy, and open 24 hrs."
11273,I love the original Frosty and like the changes that they made to their menu
11274,All everything you need in one area
11275,Best sushi in Soldotna! !
11276,Love Kiki's! The service is always great!
11277,The closest you'll get to a co-op in Alaska for some reason. Not a co-op.
11278,What an enjoyable lunch! The food and staff was excellent.
11279,Really the Best Hamburgers in Anchorage Alaska. Pretty much everything is delicious. They have fast service and friendly staff.
11280,"19 times of 20 I get excellent service at this location. That 1 time though, always puts me in a bad mood. There are a couple of people there that just talk to me and look at me like they have somewhere better to be. I end up feeling rushed out and disappointed. But the drink orders are almost always right and if you go before noon they are fast."
11281,Customer service was great and they had exactly what I wanted!
11282,"Its fast, the bread is fresh and sandwich was great"
11283,Domino's has more choices
11284,Always great service. Dining area is a bit small but the food is worth it
11285,Awseme place for the family
11286,Rating a place only makes sense when there are other choices. This is the experience in Hope.
11287,"Amazing! Food tasted so authentic and even looked like it too, it was awesome!👍🏻 Waitress was amazingly friendly, made everyone feel so welcome! Honestly, this place is like a rare hidden place no one seemed to know about. When you don't know what to eat (since there quite a few interesting dishes) the waitress will explain to you in detail what they are. Very positive vibes here at this place! Definitely will come back for sure!! (Loved eating the sticky rice with the jerky the traditional way with your hands! 👍🏻)"
11288,"Best damn burger I've had in Anchorage. They have my favorite IPA at a surprisingly low price and THE BEST DAMN BURGER I""VE HAD IN ANCHORAGE! I will be back"
11289,It's nice to find a Walmart supercenter in Anchorage. We bought fruits and other things there. The price are somewhat has higher than in normal cities and that is understandable.
11290,Great little 1 mile hike
11291,"Great food, large portions.  Loved the screened in patio. Definitely going to go again."
11292,Very good customer service.
11293,"Good, short, little hike! Beautiful falls! It is steep in some areas but not to difficult of a hike!"
11294,"I’m really impressed with the Freshly made bun. We tried the salad, chicken salad and bun cha, all pretty good. Bahn mi is my favourite so far and got me hooked and not willing to try a new dishes.

Dry noodle is a little bit on a sweet side for me but I think is to cater the American sweet tooth.

Service is fast and quick."
11295,Not to shabby for a small town island airport.
11296,Clean & pretty.
11297,Very helpful
11298,The wings here are fantastic! Great flavor. The cat fish was delicious as well. Great job guys!!
11299,"Has most of the craft supplies you are looking for. But, the staff is rude when you ask them to help even though it is their JOB to do so. They look annoyed and treat you like you are an idiotic or just try to flat out ignore you as if hoping that you will either go away or ask someone else."
11300,Fun location.
11301,Expensive but very good food
11302,"Staff are great, and the waitresses are all very courteous and patient. The only thing that keeps this place going though is the rolls. Without the rolls they would be just about average."
11303,"Beautiful forrested campground , with walking distance to the beach of Kenai Lake. The beach is long and sandy with a lot of drift wood to collect. Nice private camping spots with picnic tables and fire places. The day use area is very nice, right on the beach and also with picnic tables and fire places. Amazing place! I go here several times every summer and fall!"
11304,Amazing specials!
11305,"Friendly staff, Tony helped me and my family get the best deal on switching over from GCI. Now we have cell service at our house and my group texting started to work as soon as I switched from GCI! Yay!"
11306,Cute place!
11307,"I bought a arctic cat Bearcat last year from them they are very straight forward outfit, had a warranty item they fixed in shop no questions (it may have been my fault as well) Great pricing the air cooled machine worked considerably better than the water cooled we had for running our sled dogs."
11308,Great and frien customer service.
11309,Can't be beat
11310,"Never have been disappointed with the service or the quality! Whether it's been new tires or replacement used ones, everything was always quick, accurate and reasonable."
11311,Great chicken
11312,Good place to walk with family.
11313,Nice
11314,Yup
11315,"The good part about the rwstaurant was the beer selection and the waitress was very pleasant. But the restaurant was understaffed, we waited 30 minutes for a table that was empty when we arrived, they just hadn't gotten a chance to clean it. The food was not good, the pizza we ordered had uncooked spinach on it which I have never witnessed a pizza having before and the Flatbread was awful."
11316,"Dinner was Delicious!! The atmosphere (remodel, lighting, and music) was lovely. The staff were very friendly and attentive. It was a great dining experience!!"
11317,Love my backyard
11318,Fun fun fun
11319,Always a great way to make the pockets empty and the imagination full.
11320,Worth the food for sure
11321,This shop came through for me great service. Will use them again if I ever need body work.
11322,Fun store to get a hobby
11323,Great view of the valley and Fairbanks!
11324,The selection is pretty limited if you ask me...
11325,OK breakfast spot.
11326,"Friendly people, good choices, a service well appreciated. Thanks!"
11327,"Good fresh hot coffee, and outdoor seating.  Free WiFi too."
11328,Terrific fun with lots of booths.
11329,Great food and great movie. Beartooth never disappoints.
11330,It was alright
11331,Great food
11332,It was a bit difficult to find so we were a tad late.  Larger group than we expected upon arrival but it was still a nice time.  There was a baby reindeer that was so cute and soft to pet. Kids and I loved it.  Owners were very knowledgeable and great presenters.  Bought several bars of Buttermilk's reindeer milk soap as gifts to take home.  Great experience!
11333,Because you can smell the them coming from a mile away.
11334,Depends on the time of day you go and which crew is working but overall is your average McDonald's.
11335,I love this place especially the lugjuery recliners.
11336,"The place is nice and cozy.....however, the food was OK. My wife had halibut,  and I tried it for the first time....didn't know that 4 small cube (about 1.25 inch cube) + coleslaw = 28 dollars ! My wife thought it was Ok, but I didn't like it.....my son loved the parmesan noodle though. Even though the food was under par for me personally, but wife and kid loved it......and I like the place. Next time, I will try something different."
11337,Octopus and Halibut were both awesome
11338,"Highly suggest stopping at this Sea Life center! The exhibits are educational while, the sea life is amazing!"
11339,Fun family outing today for the Mat-Su Fall Festival
11340,"(Translated by Google) Good here.

(Original)
Хорошо здесь."
11341,I love this place they get to know you and your order personally.  Their drinks are yummy

11344,Great food and grand service. Th e waitress was exemplary!!!!!!
11345,"Great selection,  and exceptional prices!"
11346,Super expensive and the food is terrible.
11347,Kiddo and the dog had a blast!
11348,Great pizza... short wait rven though there was a crowd!
11349,"great service, even better food and open 24 hours !!"
11350,No comment
11351,Perfect gathering place for drinks with friends. Sunny outside seating overlooking the Kenai River.
11352,"I avoid getting mixed drinks here due to a weak pour and high price, but the beer is decent. I like the jack daniels sauce and the food is always good here. Lots of cute servers if that is important to you."
11353,"7/7/15 08:30 :: Had a 4 person breakfast with my boss and sales team this morning and the wait staff was atrocious, rude, and disrespectful.  I will never go back to this restaurant again.  The only saving grace was the food was relatively edible.  Denny's, The Cookie Jar, Hilltop, Deb's are all miles better.  Don't eat at this restaurant.  The building needs a remodel and has no ventilation and the wait staff is absolutely horrible, and disrespectful.  I will NEVER eat here again.  All this over a $2 rockstar I brought into the restaurant to drink with my breakfast.  No need to go into specifics.  Just avoid the place like the plague.  Overpriced.  I have never been treated with such disrespect in any dining experience...ever...."
11354,A great place for families who like to watch or play hockey
11355,How cute is this retro coca cola themed diner!  It was meticulously clean and the food was great.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Our coffee cups were kept warm and filled.  My only issue was that they serve home fries instead of hash brown.
11356,My hot Saki bottle was dirty like they didn't wash it.
11357,"The great hot foods and deli,  let's not forget the liquor ship too"
11358,"Great Service, nicest people on the earth, and amazing food."
11359,Very clean and nice rooms. Adequate breakfast and a view of the Alaska Mountain range is to die for!
11360,"Just hot coffee today for me, but they kept it hot and full. My companions got their food hot and fast. Social distancing and masking was quietly and politely observed. Attentive, friendly service. Plenty of parking."
11361,"Food was good, service was ok  but server was not attentive."
11362,Hate walmart
11363,Excellent service and food
11364,Best burger in Anchorage
11365,Delicious food always
11366,"Great food, coffee, and atmosphere!"
11367,Excellent variety of high quality juices.
11368,It's hit or miss on whether you are going to get a decent haircut or not.
11369,The salmon burger here is LITERALLY the most delicious thing I've ever eaten.
11370,Love their food. Always a great lunch
11371,Legit 5 stars.  I tried four dishes at our table and they were all excellent!
11372,Very good food and local music
11373,We were in need on a Sunday evening. They were very friendly and attentive. With evaluation and xrays on site they provided outstanding care. Its nice to have the peace of mind knowing that they are there 7 days a week.
11374,Fresh and great customer service!
11375,"Great place to grab some food, a beer, and a movie!  On particular nights it's also a good place to catch a live performance"
11376,Room was okay. Children get to play as they please. Witnessed a little girl run out of the front door almost to the street and the attendant at the desk was more worried about a phone call than helping. I guess that's what the waiver was for...
11377,Good food.  Great Service. A touch pricey.
11378,Awezo e part of the coastal trail 😎👍🏽
11379,Very good to do lunch their. Definitely not commercial type food like Taco Bell.Recommend trying
11380,Great coffee. Best part: 24/7
11381,"Best burgers in Fairbanks! The waiter never let drink get empty - he tried to push ""well done"" meats, but otherwise great!"
11382,Great service.  Awesome good.
11383,Expensive for what you get.  Nice view
11384,"Good Enough to eat when you are hungry for fast chicken, the quality is always lacking and the size of the hot wings are small as well as they were over cooked. Would rather go to the location on Bragaw."
11385,"I got a limp microwaved sandwich, but it was good for microwave food"
11386,"Prices are great, less than in Fairbanks, service could use some work....."
11387,Burrito factory is an awesome place to get burritos from. They also sell Jalapeño poppers with a cilantro lime sauce that is to die for.
11388,Thank God this place is available in Fairbanks
11389,Lovely to see exactly where you are
11390,Has what I'm looking for most of the time.
11391,Went with the wife for dinner. I had the Philly cheese steak and she had the sloppy joe sliders. Both were fantastic. Definitely going to be visiting again.
11392,Food was undercooked =(
11393,Great place to take the kids to and let them burn some energy away.
11394,"Excellent food,  service,  and drinks"
11395,Love the new remodel! Good is as good as ever!
11396,Great Pizza!!!
11397,Great staff.
11398,Store was pretty organized they just did not have everything in stock. The employees English definitely was not good.
11399,Nice size indoor pool with a water slide. Offers a family changing room. Hot tub has handicapped lift.
11400,Good airline 2 flights a day plus sometimes cargo fast and easy and the only big airline to Kotzebue and you easily earn points and rewards.
11401,"Worth price,hand washed prior to auto car wash leaves car sparkling. Regular auto car washes leave dirt behind."
11402,Amazing Place
11403,Downtown
11404,Food was ok service was A bit lame
11405,Awesome people good at answering questions about everything synthetic extension's to real high priced ones...love that they are educated and well friendly enough to explain it to ppl..muldoon beauty supply they weren't as customers friendly nor did their hair stand up to the same standards.
11406,Not worth the price.  I've come times for convenience and location. Every time my car comes out dirty like it was rained on instead of actually washed
11407,"This place is very hip and trendy. Quite a refreshing change of pace in terms of hot spots in Anchorage. Looks like they primarily serve bagels, Banh Mi sandwiches, Boba, and teas. Great customizable selection. If your looking for a new place to blow your socks off. Then go here👍"
11408,My favorite place to stay in Anchorage. Right next door to shopping and the theater. The tubs are huge!
11409,Great staff. Quick service and a varity of food to choose from.

11429,My guest from Utah lived it!
11430,great for church activities and sledding for the kids
11431,"Denali National Park and Preserve is a beautiful place with lands untouched by man. It is important to note that Denali is more of a preserve than a ""park."" Cars are not allowed beyond the bus station. You must buy a bus ticket to go to Eielson Visitor Center. If you buy a bus ticket, you can get off the bus at any stop and catch another bus later. The only problem with this is, the buses are really full, and it's very hard to find a bus that has room for you. At Eielson there is a ranger that will put you on a waiting list, and they control how many people get back on the buses from there so it is easier to get back on a bus there than at other stops.
I should also add, there is no where to buy food or drinks past the bus station, so make sure you bring all you will need for a full days' adventure! Eielson has picnic tables where you can eat lunch if you brought it. It also has a couple of small trails to beautiful views."
11432,"Young but competent staff, decent sandwiches and drink options.
Plenty of sandwich combination choices for future visits."
11433,Lunch sushi buffet is worth the money!
11434,Always a great place to eat.

11440,Messy Home Depot
11441,The employees who work there are really nice
11442,"Going to Vito's was my first choice just hearing and seeing the comments. Diego helped me with my very first car, not knowing anything about cars the staff was there to walk me thru every detail from insurance to loans they were there every step on the way. They are the best in town! I would recommend them everyday. Thanks Diego!! Y'all rock"
11443,"This gym has everything you need from a beginner to even the advanced level gym goers! It is clean they make every effort to keep the gym clean which is great especially during this COVID-19 time. Plus it's a good place for folks to gather socially obviously with social distancing but it's good to be around other human beings and everyone working towards a healthy lifestyle. So far I have no complaints 😌 and I'm hoping every experience matches the first one I had today.

11446,Great little stop
11447,This facility was able to change our oil in the motorhome and allowed us to bring our own oil and filter since they don't use our preference.  Make sure if you get a price quote to write it down along with the person's name.

11458,Love the small town atmosphere
11459,"I wasn't interested in going to the Peanut Farm based on the advertisement.  I went for a party for a friend.  I had a great time.  We sat on the back porch next to the creek and watched the salmon. We ate really good pizza and drank some good beer.  The next time I am in Anchorage, I will stop by again."
11460,"Fast service where others are full for 2 weeks for emergency repairs, comparable prices & quality parts🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍"
11461,Drinks made well. Friendly staff. Not overpriced. Adine is a great employee and my favorite!
11462,"Each time i have been here the service has always been very good. My daughter and I go there so often that we are recognized when we enter😁

11469,Almost a shame it's closing
11470,Live it!  Organized a layout are perfect.
11471,Good coffee
11472,Awesome staff that are very accommodating and they listen! Dr. Lloyd is very gentle and his techniques are unique from any other chiropractors I've seen in 30 years. I'm very impressed with how he does business. One morning I was in right after they opened and observed a team cheer by the staff - Dr. Lloyd must be an amazing guy to work for!
11473,Great place to stock up
11474,Had fun. One hr card was plenty of time. Didn't realize there were two floors til we were leaving
11475,Hiked maybe half way to the top it was breath taking!!!
11476,Excited
11477,"One of my family's favorite places for streek and bbq. Lots of southern goodness here, plenty of affordable choices, and premium cuts of steak if you want them.  It's not the quietest place in town, but fun for the family, especially for kids birthdays, everyone likes to get thier picture on the saddle Horse!"
11478,"Took my dog here to get nails trimmed, usually has a hard time at Petco, here it was five minutes and out.  Staff was friendly and the service was quick."
11479,Love these guys
11480,Great prices and good food and drink options.
11481,The curry here was my favorite over everywhere else.
11482,"Walked in there to get estimate this morning, and possibly a cup of joe.  He wouldn't give me one from His fancy dispenser since i asked the wrong question.  I asked how much it cost to place a lift kit on my van; He sent me to a full shop..."
11483,Bad management
11484,Best grocery store when you want to get and go!
11485,Really good food kinda divey looking
11486,Very nice.
11487,"A sign to indicate arctic, really long trip to there by car"
11488,Best burrito
11489,I like the place
11490,Had to get dog inspected to get on plane to lower 48 .fast service fair cost .
11491,This place doesn't grant the online menu and the quality of the food they put out is not very satisfactory as it should be especially comming from a corporation
11492,Better than most
11493,Nice place. Frendly staff. Beautiful in and out.
11494,"Great quiche and good coffee. The place was cute, and the staff very friendly and helpful."

11496,Their  nothing to post at the mall
11497,"Excellent experience including the warm welcoming receptionist Milica.

I recommend to see Anna for any massage needs  - she's the best.

I recommend you go see  Anika for any manicure or pedicure needs - smart, young and beautiful with a great passion for what she does.

Wonderful great to relax and SELF-CARE"
11498,"Great for starting up but there are better more customer friendly places in the anchorage area. The people working here have an attitude that's really off putting, like im bothering them by being a customer."
11499,Got some trans fluid for Truck
11500,Carss was fine.. found d what I needed and some icecream I didn't need..the employees were friendly and helpful.  I'm pleased to see that the outdated self check machines have been replaced...
11501,Always fun times at Tudor bingo
11502,"This was amazing and very filling.
I got a pho bowl and for the first time I tried squid with it and I was not disappointed."
11503,great ride with a bear
11504,My home
11505,"I have been here multiple times and am so underwhelmed every time I go.The donuts are not that great you would get roughly the same quality at Fred Meyers or Carr's maybe better for a cheaper price, and their donuts don't look very appealing either it looks like a child made them. I buy a bakers dozens for an expensive price and the donuts are put into a small box so that if any icing was on one it was now on two others or more. I can't say anything about the rest of the things they serve but they shouldn't make donuts anymore or get someone else to make them. Golden donuts is still the best in Anchorage and cheaper"
11506,Fun place to go out
11507,Lunch there was on a less than fresh bun. The beer was cold and tasty.
11508,Denali is VERY over rated! You get better looking mountains closer to the ocean.
11509,"Am looking to get into a bigger bus like van, luxury auto such as a raptor and a GT One to customize the autos with sound as my passion is music and I understand The Right to Travel, on July 8th I jumped in a Van at Kendall Ford that I believed my phone started,  a couple hours later was surrounded by police at gunpoint and wrongfully imprisoned as I told them what happened and I should have been let go.  The case was dismissed after 2 months wrongful imprisonment, I'm not sure if a Kendall associate called the police but feel Kendall, APD, the MUNICIPALITY OF ANCHORAGE and the STATE OF ALASKA are to compensate me in ways of automobiles, property,proper shelter, and anything else I desire

11525,Awesome selection true military discount
11526,Love the all day breakfast. Sometimes you just need an 8/9pm breakfast.
11527,Good rootbeer float.
11528,Ordered pizza last night and waited over an hour for my pizza to be delivered and when it was delivered it was super cold and the driver tried lying about how much it was so he can get an extra tip..
11529,"Picky eaters beware: the baked salmon and halibut here are bone-in, take heed before you dig in.

Went here for dinner. Most of the food was noticeably not fresh. The saving grace was that the salmon, halibut, and shrimp tempura were fresh. If not for the halibut this would've been a bust. Interior is dark and somewhat dingy.

Edit: came back on a weekend evening, lights are on and food is fresher, so the rating goes up to a 3."
11530,Great prices!
11531,Huge store- everyone there treats customers like a small town local👍 Always very helpful with returns and questions
11532,Fun place to go with friends
11533,Not a big selection and frozen items are old and mostly frosted over..
11534,It's a Chili's... But was craving some queso. Nothing making it any different than other Chili's.
11535,Close by and good prices.
11536,Great food.
11537,Amazing acoustics!
11538,Costco has some of the best prices and selections in town
11539,Reliable
11540,Packed house waiting time to wash clothes
11541,Had a BLAST doing The Great Alaskan Cannabis Bowl at Settlers Bay.
11542,Party world has all your decorating needs for any occasion. The staff is always very helpful and kind.
11543,Nice area but the restrooms could use some cleaning.
11544,This place has it all.
11545,Always delicious

11557,The food is nice. Best Korean in town.
11558,"Great food, good prices courteous people..."
11559,Easy to navigate and has almost everything i require
11560,"The staff is really friendly. This is an extremely cheap motel but, all the furniture is historic and barely works. Its also super hot. If you get room 217 there's a weird window that goes into a creepy dirt floor room with a suspicious fake plant. I would recommend this hotel if you like creepy vibes."
11561,Good popcorn
11562,Found something for  everyone
11563,Little to rich/sweer typically for my new England taste buds but it's a good favored choice of the locals definitely hits ya just the way you want
11564,"This place always hits the spot when you're looking for a great Philly cheese steak sandwich.  There are so many combinations to try and you can get extra meat.  They have a nice selection of soft drinks (Coke with real sugar made in Mexico) and great service.  Call them ahead of time and order to go, I'm warning you, they get busy."
11565,I really like the team at this store. Today confirmed it yet again.  DeJean (sorry if misspelled) from meat-fish is a Star.
11566,Amazing place to help in the community.
11567,Carrs is awesome.
11568,"Prices are very reasonable, although the produce can be iffy. Some things are good. The baggers being volunteers is a little awkward sometimes especially since their bagging skills can be so-so - don't forget to throw in a little tip!"
11569,Get as close as you can to hear the ice crack
11570,"I never found the place .. if love to try the food, guess they are mobile now. Update 10/13/18 - Thanks for the response guys, I hear tell your food is phenomenal, and I can hardly wait to try some sometime, I think it will be worth the hunt. I will update again once I get a chance to try some, I will likely want a mushroom-cheese-steak hoagie. If anyone texts them be sure to only type in the TIKITRUCK in the comment, I sent a text that day, and it did not get recognized because I typed where are you located today... I texted the correct text today. Oooh, and I got a 10% coupon texted back to me this time! now I am going to have to go get a hoagie lol....Cool! I hope I get a text soon telling me where the truck is..."
11571,Extremely long wait to be seated and then again for our food. Hamburgers were all overcooked to the point of being dry and charred.  Had to flag down wait staff for drink refills etc. Next visit to Talkeetna I will try a different restaurant.
11572,Forgot today was dividend day ....complete zoo line way around the corner easily 60 ppl with carts waiting to get in standing singe file so I'm assuming as ppl came out a few were let in. Will def wait till the pfd money is gone before heading there
11573,A good cultural center
11574,I never get a bad southwest salad if u add double the chicken it makes it a rocking salad that can't b beat the grilled chicken is very moist and flavorful
11575,Prices are pretty high here. Most of there products are for the Asian and Samoan communities. The products that are for everyone else are way to highly priced. Example: there Coffeemate creamers are at least $2 higher than regular stores. Way to highly priced.
11576,Gets better each time we visit!
11577,"Great park with lots of different areas for kids of almost all age groups! Beware there are people who walk with dogs off leash around that park often. This park is great all year round, sledding in the winter and theres a large concrete area for children to ride bikes and scooters in the summer."
11578,It was my first time eating here and it wasn't bad. The server was helpful and patient with us. I can see why families would like Olive Garden. I probably wouldn't recommend it for a nice date though. But the food was good regardless!
11579,Very pleasant and a nicer bed than my home.🤕
11580,Always a great selection tons of stuff
11581,"Terrible construction, cheap materials, and I am dreading moving out. Horror story after horror story of people being charged thousands of dollars for new carpet. Be extremely detailed on the move in list. This is one of those contracts that should be under FWA review. This should be part of draining the swamp!"
11582,"They are only open during the summer, but it is one of the best places for lunch. The pitas are great, and it is one of the only good places to eat outdoors."
11583,Not worth the money....way to expensive.... for a sandwich!
11584,"By far the best Thai in Fairbanks, and the best Thai ive ever had period. Lemongrass is hands down exceptional, every single time. A must have any time you visit Alaska!"
11585,Great staff and service. Highly recommend
11586,love this place. great food. Awesome service
11587,Great food
11588,Awesome!!!!
11589,"Service was good, drinks where good, food worts ever"
11590,"The Auto Skills Center has awesome tools and services for anyone not invested in automotive care. But would rather spend less money to complete the same repairs, upgrades, or swaps on their personally owned vehicles. They even offer services to store your vehicle on site in the event that it's not functioning immediately or is still in the middle of repairs/refit. They have the facilities to do everything up to engine swaps on site for you to rent. Only downsides are the tight spaces."
11591,The pioneer burger will test you no matter what but I love it!
11592,Love the thai chicken salad!
11593,The only place with the best shoes and service!
11594,Great gift ideas

11603,Enjoyed this place
11604,You can find it at brown jug
11605,"The people who work here are fast friendly helpful. The hot food area is usually clean and well stocked same with the soda fountain area. They have decent prices and I like using their rewards program. The only thing about this holiday that I don’t care for and why it didn’t get five stars is the environment, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had strangers ask for a ride ask for money try to sell me some weed there’s always a moocher at every door in the afternoon and I feel like the staff should handle that but other than that I like this holiday and it’s easy to find it’s right on my way out of town."
11606,Best pizza in town always jam packed
11607,Nice and clean
11608,"Sushi is ok.  They have large rolls that are well suited to traditional American tastes.  The fried and the fat tend to feature a bit much in comparison to the fish.  In addition I found the wait staff were nice enough but do not go out of their way to be accommodating.
I am not in a rush to return."
11609,"There is a really nice Dog Park here,  as well as a playground for the kids."
11610,Not to busy at all
11611,"excellent work, helpful... good folk. giving them repeat business."
11612,So much fun. Great to see the animals.
11613,Good local good
11614,"This place is awesome. Very helpful staff, great prices. What I like most is that they are currently doing a small discount for when you donate a jacket. Shows that they care about the community."
11615,Love the scenary
11616,Best donuts in town!!!
11617,"It is like a Mini Shopping Mall with a variety of small store were you can Shop, Eat, Buy Knick Knacks to display in your home or give gifts about your vacation which represents that states"
11618,"Amazing delicious food, loved the bacon of the month dish - brie bacon puffs. The $1 popcorn is also amazing I wished I got more to go. The jambalaya was also tasty so was the specialty drinks and desserts."
11619,Go Spin the wheel

11621,Very enjoyable and relaxing for a movie theater
11622,"Great food, awesome place to watch the sea planes take off. The ahi salad is incredible!"

11631,Consistently good!
11632,Great for all ages. Worth doing.
11633,Fave
11634,"I was eating there quite often for a while. Loved the banzai bowl and teriyaki chicken. Never had any issues other than a few veggies that were a bit weird/had blck spots but just recently ordered the bbq sandwich (teriyaki chicken, bbq sauce, tomato and lettuce) and was super grossed out. Got halfway through it and got a bite of something rotten. Didnt open it up to look at ot because I would have freaked out if I would have seen something gross so I just threw it away and went back to work. Never eating there again man that was nasty."
11635,Great fresh mexican food great prices we go quite often and never had a bad experience A must stop if traveling through Soldatna ot Kenai
11636,"Fishermen's Bend is a card-lock gas station with no on-site staff. It has the lowest gasoline prices in Juneau. The station used to have a store as well, but that burned down in 2008."
11637,"Clean place, nice people.  They even sanitized my pen 👏"
11638,A good place to see exotic and alaskan animals. They have a great gift shop and petting zoo for their goat population. It's a great place to bring your family if they have never seen these types of animals.
11639,"Best part?  No tourists!  Lol, good grub!"
11640,Wednesday night trivia is the best anywhere
11641,Really enjoy our meals each time we visit.
11642,Wait staff rules
11643,"It was busy (UFC Fight) slow ordering to be expected.  But 15 min for drinks, forgot my appetizer and 45 min to get food out."
11644,"Beautiful lodge, great view, lots of activities nearby...the restaurant has great food but a little expensive."
11645,They named it right.
11646,"Fresh hot pieces of chicken, hot mash potatoes fries beans and rice... It was all good today.. yep we ate it quickly..."
11647,Loved the staff there. An the whole sale prices are great for big families. I especially love the holiday specials they do
11648,Tasty falafel. Fresh ingredients. Made to order. Outdoor seating in great summer weather. Tables and seating areas needed attention. Trash from previous patrons were on the tables.
11649,I had some wheel questions and these guys helped me get it figured out for a complicated wheel and tire set up
11650,They have good food
11651,Very pleasant and relaxing. Beautiful view from our room.
11652,"I love this library, clean and nice people too!"
11653,Great Pizza and they treat you right... I liked the food and the selection of beer on tap was good for the Kenai!  Will keep this place as a return location!
11654,Great service
11655,"Nice staff, clean facilities"
11656,"Barnes & Noble is the only national chain bookstore in Alaska. This location is small compared to many locations in the lower 48, but it is the best you will find for browsing new books in Anchorage. To browse used books try Title Wave Books."
11657,Love
11658,Love watching the trains come into and leave the station
11659,"Friendly service and convenience made me a first time customer stop by.
I got my oil changed in a few hours which I found plenty fast and they were pretty busy.
They did a free diagnostic helped me see things to remedy in future.
As a side note has an old time auto shop feel which I really like!"
11660,Half of the shelf are empty are they going out of business.
11661,Call any other cab service then this horrible horrible company.
11662,"This is a cool old style place. No smoking anymore so its much better.
Still its a dark littl bar but the Halibut is very good, My opinion that is the only reason to go. No high chairs for kids and waiters and bartenders are clueless on moat things you want to order other then beer or a jack and coke.
History gives this place a five but thats about it."
11663,Great place great food
11664,Had fabulous donuts and coffee. But the best part was listening to this man's group sing an Irish blessing to us.
11665,A beautiful place to stop and enjoy the view
11666,"(Translated by Google) great, advice not to go in summer

(Original)

11687,"Refreshed, renovated!"
11688,Good food
11689,Going here for four years. If they don't have what you need. All you need to do is ask and they most likely can order it for you. My favorite elder there is so sweet. She may have health issues but she always has a smile on her face. She always makes you feel welcome.  This women works hard. Also my kids love their fresh popcorn.
11690,"Diverse selection of well, everything."

11698,Great food and good price

11700,my favorite mall. i love lush. bath body works. body shop. sephoras. great alaska berry . gamestop. claires. victoria secert is opening i love it the food court needs more shops
11701,"This is my favorite grocery store. I do use their app for coupons, otherwise I find they're a bit pricey, but I love the people that work here. Been shopping here a long time and they make it feel like a small town grocery store where everyone knows you."
11702,Foods great.  Service is good.  Line sucks
11703,Beautiful park with miles of trails. One of my absolute favorite places to go for a run!
11704,Fun lil place . dont forget bread and seeds to feed the ducks!

11706,Went in there and to get something for my dog like one particular item. I didn't realize that my dog is hard to shop for
11707,This is the perfect place to spend a cold winter evening. The food is delicious and it’s fun to watch such a variety of movies.
11708,The trip to the Rapids up the susitna was amazing.  A must do trip.
11709,"This isn't the cheapest place but they do a very good job.  My spouse has 2 ingrown toe nails and they make her feel so much better.  They have massage chairs, foot baths, and really make you feel special so if you want to spoil someone or yourself go here."
11710,Fries tasted like old oil
11711,"great food, excellent service"
11712,One of the best places on Earth.
11713,"Always friendly service, thank you..."
11714,Awesome view.

11716,Very nice people. Not too many rules. Prices are fair.
11717,"Excellent service for all my machines, Toyo, generator, chainsaw,..."
11718,No body knows where things are
11719,In need of an upgrade for sure
11720,"Tried to order vacuum seal bags that were out of stock, and told it would take probably 5 weeks to get. I know this is Alaska, but it is only the middle of June, and with peak season still 2 weeks away, you shouldn't be out of ANY style of vacuum bags that you carry, and not have the ability to order more in a timely manner. The Walmart in Anchorage said it would be a week to get them after we bought them out."
11721,This is a great spot for those awkward first dates. No long uncomfortable gazes into each other’s eyes BECAUSE YOU CANT SEE EACH OTHER! You can talk to each other and smell one another’s “do they like me or do they not” musk. Highly recommend wearing clean socks. Don’t pull those crusty socks from the bottom of the basket you will be required to remove shoes. 10/10 would recommend.
11722,"Fast service, nice enough wait staff, food was pretty bleg for the price. My kid's waffles were cold and my omelet was DRIPPING grease and butter."
11723,"Amazing variety, and a awesome seafood!"
11724,Great
11725,"(Translated by Google) Beautiful exhibition on the fauna present in the park. An explanatory film in English. The rangers very present and good advice.

(Original)
Belle exposition sur la faune présente dans le parc. Un film explicatif en anglais. Les rangers bien présents et de bons conseils."
11726,Great museum. Cars matched with clothing from different eras and more.
11727,The employee Emma is the best worker there she needs a raise
11728,"Nice place to sit and relax. Foods good, good service as well. Place seems to be pretty busy every time I go there. Entertainment (guitar player) live is nice. The high ceilings make the music a little loud (playing over din of crowd) sound is too focused? Maybe up date audio system? Installing some sound bricks vaulted ceiling would definitely help! Can be a little difficult carrying on a conversation... but I still go there! Worthy of a visit!"
11729,"I meet my granddaughter at olive garden for lunch. We both love to have lunch there. The salad is always cold and crisp. And its not just lettuce and a slice of tomato like some places I have eaten. It has onion, tomato, lettuce, black olives green peppers ECT.
Really taste. Hot bread. I also had the soup
Which is always good. Its clean and the service is pretty good. Helpful."
11730,"Most eclectic niche around. Local artwork, relaxed atmosphere, great coffee..and the food is a bit 'meh'  but the menu is ok. Open mic in Fri nites, local music in Saturdays. Cutest coffeeshop on rye Peninsula, located in historic old town Kenai"
11731,"This place is new and updated. Our room had a kitchenette which was awesome because even though we only stayed a short time, it's nice to have a full fridge and a place to make a hot meal. Has a large swimming pool. Free morning breakfast is a huge spread and they have an ""omelette chef."" The staff are friendly. One of the best places I've ever stayed, to be honest."
11732,Fast fresh food for lunch was amazing!
11733,This is a good place to learn when you know nothing about Alaska and the Native Alaskans and how they lived and were successful. I love it here nice place.
11734,Limited menu. $$$/$$$$ for price.
11735,Busy mall. Excellent services.
11736,Very friendly and they made my drink properly! Awesome!Service was also faster than most of all the other locations.
11737,Not to friendly
11738,Truly impressive facility. Great location. They were setting up a large Magic tournament in the back while we were there. They had an X-men comic my son had been seeking at a very good price. Knowledgeable staff and an amazing collection. Now I’ve got their bumper sticker on my laptop. So glad our Anchorage friends recommended it. Worth the trip to Alaska!
11739,Landscape and wildlife - all is jaw dropping beautiful
11740,Good soup
11741,"Pretty solid rental place, but fails on the marine side. Can’t rent a boat until 0930. By the time you get out of there it’s 10am. Almost all decent fishing grounds (ocean) are at least 3.5-5hrs away. We got our boat at 10 on Friday, drove 4 hours to Homer, put the boat in the water and motored to the fishing grounds(another 1.5 hours). That put us at about 6 hours (4pm)just to get fishing. Now here is your biggest dilemma; do you fish longer hours and drive back tired? Or fish for a couple hours so you can drive back with energy. This is all of course if you rent the boat for just one day. But even if you rent multiple days, your first days rental you end up spending more time driving and putting the boat in and out of the water than you actually spend on the water. I understand there is nothing the outdoor rec can do to fix drive time, but they have options.
When a boat is returned they leave the day after vacant so they can prep and maintain every boat before it gets rented again(actually a great practice). Here is where my issue is; this means the boat is just sitting in the lot from 6pm-930am the next day. Why not let a renter pick it up(if ready of course) the evening before so they can either get in the road that evening or leave at 5am like most of us fishiest like to do. I understand there might be delays if the boat is still being worked on, but the majority of all know this is the case and are more than willing to wait later that evening if needed. Anything is better than having to wait until 10am to get I the road no matter how many days you’ve rented. At the least just open the office earlier to customers (employees are already at work at 8am) who are renting ocean boats. Help us deep sea fishers out!"
11742,So much selection! My dogs love it when I visit here!
11743,Very selection
11744,"Excellent pizza in the rustic Italian style (think thin, crispy crust with a light hand on the toppings). Highly recommend the salads, breadsticks, and homemade gelato as well!"
11745,Good service. Good food.
11746,Side Walk Noodle soup is amazing here!
11747,"Amazing food, amazing staff, if I could give 10 stars I would. The zeama is so delicious, I highly recommend it!"
11748,Please take time to stop in.  It's worth your time!
11749,Spent it w/ one of my best friend !
11750,Love the hotel. Great service
11751,Always great
11752,I love the soup with kale a  d that's what I mainly go there for amazing
11753,"Jade Street Park is also the home of the Dimond West Little League.  There are three ball fields with a facility for scoring, broadcasting, and concession foods.  Safely nearby is a large grass field with soccer goals and a small park for children.  The parking lot is a medium size with a couple mobile restrooms.  There are few benches here, so bring your chairs.

The Jade Street Park is open from 6:00 AM - 11:00 PM."
11754,Open 24 hours
11755,I was surprised when we actually got into our lunch! I think that it is better than subway! All though I do love subway!
11756,Friendly fast service.
11757,"Clean, organized, employees are good help. I needed someone to carry my battery in and back out to the car since I am using crutches at the moment.  They came right out and also helped me right away"
11758,We go to the fair every year.  Love it!
11759,Kind of has the monopoly on big box stores now that Sams Club is gone
11760,Needs showers and restrooms with running water
11761,"Awesome for bike ride,horse ride, hiking, jogging"
11762,They had everything we needed
11763,"Nice lake retreat to rent all types of boats including small sail boats ⛵️, great prices by the hour.  Beautiful area and somewhat quiet lake if there is not a big party going on in the nearby rec. center building.  Recommend for a relaxing afternoon or evening., cabins available to rent also ."
11764,It's okay pizza for Alaska
11765,I like taco's
11766,"Like selection, price, nice people"
11767,"(Translated by Google) Cozy with super friendly boys.
Lively, pets are allowed.
All good!!

(Original)
Acogedor con mozos super amables.
Animado, admiten mascotas.
Todo bien!!"
11768,One of the best sushi bars in Anchorage.
11769,"Definitely one of the cheapest motels in the Soldotna area if you need a room for the night. Small cramped rooms, but you get another $10 a night off for rooms above the bar because of the noise, which actually isn't all that bad. Surprisingly, the restaurant is pretty damned good, and I've eaten there a number of times."
11770,Great!
11771,Love the cheese curds.
11772,Awesome breakfast!
11773,Awesome!! Thank you!
11774,"Love this place! Wish it was open longer into the year, though :("
11775,Quick walk through but seemed convenient
11776,The man knows what he's doing and the prices are fair
11777,Geary pizza. Nice place for lunch
11778,Awesome helicopter trip to Mendenhall glacier. Once in a lifetime
11779,Scary run down place.
11780,Cooking steaks in the brick oven does something to them that makes them melt in your mouth and tender enough you barely need a knife .   We also tried the Halibut morsels & Calimari .   They serve a Strawberry - Rhubarb wine from a local winery that is amazing.
11781,"Can be way too loud, not even with people inside. Staff seem so worn most of the time. Games can be pretty fun and the pizza is better than i had anticipated.
The ticket counting is antiquated and not sure why they aren't just measured anymore. What is the point to shredding them, are they recycled and the shredding just taking that step out to help with their reuse?"
11782,"Great place to stop and eat. Good food, friendly staff"
11783,consistency of honesty and interest of my report. friendly and compassionate to my questions and needs
11784,"Super awesome ACYE sushi. So much better than Asiana when it comes to the quality of sushi. We stopped going to Asiana due to the rice ratio, and Seoul Sushi actually adds in the meat. Definitely worth the $25"
11785,Love every time!!!
11786,very good service and great meet
11787,"Nice staff. Knowledgeable vets, clean rooms"
11788,Always a greeting when you walk in. Good friendly staff.
11789,Always a good place to get your ride profomace tip top
11790,"Cute boutique with a variety of locally made merchandise.  Finally got to pick up and treat myself to some cool stuff: a hoodie, a racerback tee, and a new trucker hat (been wearing the same one and needed to give it a break). I especially enjoyed browsing through designs by local artists. The tee and hoodie i picked out are made in the USA and I really appreciate that. I could have and would have liked to have spent more time looking around. Definitely will return and is a good place to find future Alaska made gifts for family and friends ""outside""."
11791,"Great selection, and an attentive staff that was able to help me find just what I was looking for- a MUST for higher-end R.V. investors."
11792,"Happy so far! Gave them a try because they are so close to my house. Have taken both my dogs here a few times and we usually get a different vet each time. I’m not opposed to this but I am used to the consistency of the same vet each time at other clinics I’ve been to. However, each vet we had was really great and provided exceptional care and information."
11793,"Good to great all around... With the hardest to decipher bill ever. LOL. And, we did just that with our great waitress. Don't let that throw you. It's all good, but don't expect to understand a bill with doubles and top shelf upgrades and such. It's new math writ large. Grin."
11794,"The manager at this store is a young 20 something year old power freak. His employees don't respect him, they fear him and it's sad to watch. Also the Fred Meyer on Northern lights has ten times the selection, space, happy customers, and employees. Definitely worth the drive to shop at the Northern Lights location instead of this one!!"
11795,Truly the last frontier!
11796,Something to do in Fairbanks when it's raining or 40 below out
11797,Good food.  And made it outside made it soo much better in the sunshine
11798,"Love this store, always stocked nicely and the staff are helful."
11799,Was never partial but food was decent
11800,"I give a 2 because I am suppose to get my airbag replaced and they say they can rent to 19+ but when I arrive they say they can only rent to 25+. This is really inconvenient because I’m going on a roadtrip and they can’t rent to me. It’s most inconvenient when you have to reschedule and know there’s a danger in the car.

UPDATE: I was reviewed the policy for Alaska and how the lower 48 doesn’t apply for Alaska but they use an 907 # for a out of state call box.

I would have updated to a 4 star but it’ll now be a 1 star because of there ridiculous prices and method they use which is called “book time”

However I was seeing about getting my PCV valve replaced on a 2011 Toyota Corolla and it’s a 35-45 min job but the dealership says they charge for 1.8 hours even if it takes less then an hour. This is really inconvenient for me!!"
11801,The games are fun and its a great place to let the kids run off some of that stuck indoors winter energy. The staff is helpful and always has a smile. Bring your wallet your going to need it 😀
11802,One of my favorite rivers to go to very beautiful scenery
11803,"Really, really good Phillys.  They make their own bread"
11804,DMV is nice but I didn't go through the whole mall.
11805,Great food and excellent service
11806,Great peaceful environments. Professional

11808,Great service Aiden huff was extremely helpful really appreciate him
11809,The employees were friendly and helpful very nice shopping experience.
11810,Great people.
11811,"Took my Mom out for dinner. There was a line waiting to be seated when we arrived. I was expecting a wait. Imagine my surprise when everyone in line was seated within just a few minutes. That was pretty awesome. Had a cup of soup as an appetizer. The Clam Chowder was really good as were our Steak Sandwiches. Our server was super nice and very attentive.  Our drink glasses never emptied. Alright, so the drinks were water but still impressive."
11812,A beautiful lake in a secluded mountainous area. Very dog friendly!
11813,Poor if do not cancel your reservation  24 hour head they steel your money give them 0000 for rooms dirty noise air conditioning really. Don't stay their...
11814,Nice place
11815,great food!
11816,"Grocery store with just about anything you could possibly need including beer, wine, and liquor. Open 24 hours. I would give them 5-stars if their deli, seafood section, and bakery were also open 24 hours"
11817,They'll arrange for a plane to take your purchases to you in places where nobody else delivers. I assume that it's very expensive.
11818,"This is a bit more than moderate hiking it's on the verge of strenuous but most everybody that's in pretty well shape can do it just take your time relax and enjoy You do not have to climb the top of the high part of the glacier to enjoy the scene or majesty of how great and massive glaciers are!
I am on the larger side but had no problem navigating with just some good hiking boots on It will get to your knees after a while because you're walking on ice and there's no cushion. The guided tours look informative and they do supply you with some extra equipment but we felt like that wasn't quite necessary so we did the self-guided tour just to see what it was all about and had more than enough enjoyment three and a half hours gone just like a snap of a fingers And about 200 pictures later we were back at our car enjoying the ride home.
If you have the time this is a must do it's the closest glacier to parking and the easiest navigable due to them setting up cones on the best places to walk. they don't give you much of an instruction manual as long as you're walking on the rocks dirt or the crunchiness of the ice especially where little trails of water running you won't have too many issues it's when you get up on top of the ice where it's slick."
11819,Ok
11820,Very helpful to be able to get more grocerys
11821,"Awesome service,  helped my husband find everything he needed in one place !"
11822,"You haven't had Alaskan king crab until you've had Tracy's Alaskan king crab. A pretty fun joint with tasty craft root beer. But their namesake is why you should go. This isn't some tourist trap with mediocre food... No, Tracy's served up the largest, tastiest king crab I've ever (EVER!) had. Oh yeah, and their bisque and crab cakes were to die for, but took up space that should have been filled with another massive crab leg! The wait was a bit lengthy, but that just gave us a little more time to rest our feet. Too bad I didn't try Tracy's until my second visit to Juneau, but I will be back... I can't wait to go back!"
11823,I was looking for new tires for my truck. Sales person was very friendly and gave printed estimates for several different tire brands. However their prices were higher than other stores in the area for same tires so no deal this time. Thank you anyway.
11824,"Good food, friendly service."
11825,Nice and clean
11826,Too expensive for bread

11832,One of the best Mexican restaurants I have eaten at!!  And in Alaska of all places!
11833,"Facilities inside are good, but winter parking is an ice skating rink due to lack of drainage."
11834,Beautiful store! Great selection of candles and a decent selection of crystals too
11835,Some of the best food and atmosphere in Alaska! A definite must stop and enjoy when near Girdwood
11836,"Large room with limited amenities. But their breakfast buffet has quite variety of food(egg with cheese, bacon, boiled eggs, fruit salad and yogurt and other bread and cereal) though fruit could be little more fresh."
11837,"Best coffee in the worl!
And the staff a absolutely  wonderful!"
11838,Love all the new wash machines and dryers.
11839,Park looks great.
11840,"Great place to take the family, engaging and friendly staff and you get to see reindeer and moose up close!"
11841,Helps people and it's old school
11842,Very helpful and friendly staff.  The AT&T store in the same mall just down the street should take notes from these guys.
11843,If it weren't for the amazing fried pickles and fries I would have had a less of a good experience since we waited for 50 minutes before we got our food. There was only 2 gals running around and it was madness.....
11844,"Our kitten was neutered at the SPCA. They were efficient and very friendly. My kitten looked great, not too stressed and healed very well. We had a great experience and it was cheaper than other places."
11845,"Great sandwiches,  plus they have potato cakes,  which are much better than fries."
11846,The food and wait staff great

11853,One of the best places to drink beer and chill in town.
11854,"Some of the best pizza in town is found here, some say. A great place to watch sports on the TV with friends. Service is hit or miss."
11855,"We visited from Dallas, and this place was great! I had the Barents Sea Legs and they were perfectly prepared. Service and view wre phenomenal. Only complaint is that the dining area is somewhat warm since the kitchen is open and near. Perhaps wear rollup sleeves?"
11856,Had the spudnics OMG. SOOO good I went 2 times today...Love the food the service is excellent...
11857,"Nothing else comes close for pizza in Alaska. There's a reason this place is always packed.

My top pizzas are Steak Chipotle and Santa's Little Helper."
11858,really expensive. but a wonderful store. tons of variety.

11862,It's Costco
11863,Cute little gas station store! Friendly staff
11864,What a fantastic state fair!!!! It was so unique having almost 100% local vendors and few transient workers/vendors. It almost felt like a festival instead of a fair. There was differnt live music around each corner. Just wonderful! We really enjoyed going to this fair!!!
11865,Love shopping there. Always big selection of bargain books
11866,Cheap.  Good popcorn.  Audio listening devices.  Great service I love this place great for quiet date nights or movies with kids.

11871,That's a pretty good grocery store there

11875,Love me some yummy chicken
11876,Interesting stop hit or miss on wildlife
11877,"New shop, has common things you need. Didn't try the food, but looked fresh."

I was there yesterday, paid $18 for water. I called the company, left a voicemail and they haven't called me back. The machine only sprayed water, no soap, only water."
11892,This is a charming little coffee shop with an appealing menu for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. I tried their zebra hot cocoa and was very impressed. Hoping to visit again sometime!
11893,Great burgers and fries
11894,The view was amazing I would recommend this place to anyone! There's even an observation area too!!!;

11975,"Very nice people, rooms are cozy"
11976,"This place is pretty new to the Peninsula I have yet to be in the breakfast/coffee side but I did have a chance to have dinner at their new restaurant. The menu is kind of short but there are a few good options on there that I enjoyed specifically enjoyed the sliders and I believe my dad enjoyed the Ahi Tuna,  we also ordered soup it was really good it’s tomato base also the coffee was extremely good I ordered the
chicken curry for dinner personally I like rice with my curry and it came with bread other than that I thought it was good .  I believe I saw hydroponics trailer behind the restaurants I would imagine they are growing their own vegetables especially from what I tasted I have not tasted that fresh vegetables in a while .  We were given a free bread pudding dessert by our server and it was good. Great place for a date or dinner with loved ones. Maybe business lunch. Anyway can’t wait to try the Waffles!"

11990,Pleasant outdoor market with local foods and crafts

12042,Didn't have what I asked for
12043,My kids like the pizza
12044,Voted Best Pizza in Alaska and is nationally recognized. Incredible pizza with lots of wheat/gluten free options. Diablo bread sticks are amazing and garlic/mozzarella pizza dough served with a spicy ranch sauce. Must try! I LOVE peanut butter pie and hands down the BEST I have ever had. Addicted and all the desserts are good but definitely try the peanut butter!
12045,"So how many times do I need to tell you about homeless people camping on the corner of Barrow and 26th next to a fence, shooting up heroin and causing havoc for the people that live DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET? How many times do I have to be told ""We'll send someone over"" before you actually do it?"
12046,Got the 8$ wash after coating my car with mud in seward. Car came out clean with no scratches or residue
12047,Baja Chicken Bacon Ranch  wrap is my favorite. Their gluten free wraps are great and the staff are awesome about loading up the pitas
12048,Great place for dinner
12049,"Very good fresh halibut. Fries were probably my favorite--crispy. We had the deep fried halibut, halibut burger, salmon dip with crackers, and polar bear silk pie. Flavor didn't POP for me so that's why I only gave it a 4 star. Service is pretty good and the Oceanside view is great. Prices are decent compared to the other restaurants on homer spit."
12050,Delicious food.  Staff is very nice.  Been there for a romantic dinner and a big family dinner.  Just a great place
12051,Staff can be rude
12052,Great pizza at this bar. Good drinks as well. Very good service from both the bartender and the pizza maker. Will definitely be back.
12053,"Staff is always great and funny. They jumped when I called because we didn't have any towels. They arrived right away to snake the tub when it wouldn't drain and then againwhen the heat wouldn't stop. They brought coffee, sugar and creamer in the morning when we couldn't find any. And came right up with the special remote to turn on the cable box. The lobby is clean but unfortunately a little too frequented by drunks."
12054,"Easy to find, quite a large lot, well marked trail. However, there have been numerous reports recently of cars being broken into at this trail head, so please be aware."
12055,"Good teas, excellent prices for Alaska, and very knowledgeable staff. I'd go here over Teavana any day!"

12064,Great view
12065,I know Moose's Tooth is everyone's go to for pizza but the Alehouse is my favorite pizza hands down. And none of the wait!
12066,"Cuban food is one of my favorites, and I really enjoyed this place. They had live music on a Saturday night which was excellent. Overall I definitely recommend this place and I'm sure that if I come back to Fairbanks I'll be eating here again."
12067,Fantastic views
12068,"Great food, bit pricey for fast food, but worth it"
12069,Very Impressed with the exhibits!
12070,ALL the staff here are amazing

12072,good burgers but holy cow man the time it took to order at 8pm at night is ridiculous. There was only two people ahead of me
12073,Very nice selection & variety of american & Asian foodstuffs! Excellent seafood selection with the better prices in Anchorage! There deli is pretty extensive that the menu changes daily & built in bakery & coffee bar that serves Kaladi Brothers coffee! My favorite grind!
12074,Staff was friendly. They helped me pick out most things I needed. There was a few things they didn't have so I went to Amazon to pick up the other things. That's when I discovered I had paid more than double for everything at Southside than what I saw on Amazon. I don't mind paying a bit more over internet prices to support local but it really stings to find out you just got raked over the coals. Of course no returns except for store credit..I checked the reviews here before I shopped and no one mentions prices. Well here it is. They are horrific. I could see using this place as maybe an emergency source bit other than that I would just order online if you're not in a hurry.
12075,Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.
12076,"I've been going to the Pioneer home very long time. It is run by the state, you have to be a veteran or a Pioneer to live there."
12077,This is a cool little place with some neat food you can't get anywhere else in town. It's worth a stop for sone interesting things you may not have had before.
12078,Every day Grocery needs found here
12079,"This place is awesome.  From the assortment of toys, not all of which I would really go so far as to call classic, it's easy to get lost, it is only a small drawback.  The employees are pretty great as well.  This post was edited on 2/28/2018 for clarity and understanding.  The drawback of classic versus nonclassic toys is not why I rated it four stars.  In recognition of the store being great, the 4 stars is strictly due to parking availability.  It is much easier to park farther away and visit but the nearby parking options ('Barnes and Noble' and Dennys) can be treacherous depending on weather and small children accompanying the visit."
12080,The food was delicious.
12081,"Awesome sushi place! I love the Lunch boxes on weekdays, and for dinner the Hot Night roll is the best. Very good poke appetizer, and tempura calamari. Nothing not to like here."

12092,sales representative was high. Store is nice and a great value.
12093,Great staff and all the Vets. are knowledgeable and informative of the process for treatment.
12094,This place deserves Five Stars in my opinion!!! The owner is Awesome and so are her employees!!! I literally enjoy drinking the coffee from here. It is quality service and quality products. Thank you!

12096,Great food at a reasonable cost!

12099,"The kombucha is delicious, and the staff is super friendly!"
12100,This is Nome. This place is very clean and has such friendly service. Tha staff are great. This is a great location in the downtown area and close to all amenities. The beach is right across the street and fun to stroll. This is one of the best places to stay.
12101,Lively place & had tons of fun!
12102,"I think this is a good Arby's. Nice food,nice environment, and good employees. I just wish there was something to write home about. Other than that, I have nothing wrong with it."
12103,Center of downtown. Nice food court.
12104,"I ordered buffalo wings, and a burger with a side of wing sauce. The wings and sauce tasted like A1 with extra pepper in it. I asked what it was and was told it was their ""buff sauce."" After specifically asking for buffalo wing sauce I was disappointed to receive something with a drastically different flavor. The burger was good, but would have been better with wing sauce."
12105,Hit or miss on getting orders quckly. Overall ok.
12106,Had a great time viewing all the animals. Loved the bear catwalk.
12107,The pot sticker soup is always a go to.

12110,Best one I've bern yo. Fresh hot worth the wait.
12111,Sorry but a far cry from Christmas!
12112,Best  experience
12113,"I prefer this location over Wasilla- this team never makes me feel dumb for ordering a ""medium"" or ""16 ounce"" coffee bc I can't remember their dumb name for it 😅 Wasilla team makes a big point to correct me when I say it, no big deal.  Starbucks annoys me with their seasonal options anyway- it's 2019 it's not like you can't get pumpkin spice flavoring in May just sayin'."
12114,Awesome and kind
12115,staff was helpful and pleasant.
12116,Standard.
12117,"Not happy with their service, the one at Seward Meridian and Palmer/Wasilla hwy.
Needs to have a talk with the employees, they where acting inappropriate, using bad language and loudly arguing with each other.
I will definitely think twice about going back"
12118,Good drinks ok food
12119,Check the part in the box before leaving the store lol ... Great service good advice and they have the match the lowest price offer so if you can find it for lower they will match it but always check the box and the part they are known for getting shipments mixed up

12123,"Love this place! Good food, nice atmosphere, beautiful presentation and great service!!!"
12124,Great place to shop
12125,Due to missing suply trucks the selection in fruits and vegetables were lacking. Note that their service desk closes early like 8 pm. No refunds after that!
12126,"Great food, great service, classy atmosphere. Sometimes a little loud, but not too bad."
12127,Great shopping selection. Only needs grocery store and it would be ones stop shopping
12128,"Great food and amazing staff. They have a great fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine, a wide variety of Soju, and fantastic deserts."
12129,"From the restaurant to the spa to the northern lights tour it was all amazing. The actual rooms at the resort were a bit outdated, but let's be honest Noone goes there for the rooms"

12141,"I've stayed here 3 weeks while fishing un Alaska, the people are great and the food is good. The cafe is open 24/7 and there's a bar. Just on the other end of the block there's an espresso shop and other eateries nearby in downtown Palmer."

People camping in the edges of the property. If I didn't have an appointment, I would never shop at this store. Don't go there, find another store."
12163,"An Alaskan saloon, basically the Ester Community Center. Inexpensive beverages, pool, cook-your-own burgers. Will seem clubby if you're new, but Ester loves people who can carry on a thoughtful conversation. Yes, at a bar."
12164,"Lively local hangout. A few groups of friends were playing pool that night. The beer selection was good, I had the Flat Iron sandwich, delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive."
12165,"Multiple visits, always rude. Asked if they had throw away e-cigs and the lady treated me like a leper. If you hate your job so much then quit. Avoid at all costs..."
12166,Great food great atmosphere. Long waits but it's worth it.
12167,I have yet been too a three bears that i have left disappointed.  It seems they know what they're doing..lol.  The produce is super shawty like everybody else in Alaska but when they hit the honey crisp are amazing for alaska standards.
12168,"I absolutely hate this place. Nobody has any knowledge of the animals in there especially the reptiles. I always go in and see baby bearded dragons housed together and being fed improper foods. It makes me sick that this place is around as a big corporate company that doesn’t actually care for the well being of its animals. They’re just there to make money. Only reason I come here is to get horn worms, even though they are usually dead and overpriced. Also really important* their “getting to know your” whatever pet pamphlets are completely inaccurate."
12169,"Interestingly, there is no company email to contact anyone from this company. Had a seriously terrible interaction with an employee tonight and may never use this business again. I won't be changing this review until I sit down with managment and discuss the issue or have my lawyer deal with it."
12170,I love all the bargains. One Stop shopping
12171,"Great staff, knowledgeable,  easy to work with!"
12172,Almost always have the parts I need in stock and very knowledgeable staff. Quality parts.
12173,It's your typical O'Reilly Auto Parts. Nothing more nothing less.
12174,Best bakery in Anchorage. Period.
12175,"Sometimes hit, sometimes miss but a nice clean environment."
12176,Nice small mall
12177,"The place to be after hours. If you're a single woman, this is where all the affluent guys end up."
12178,We went for a retirement event.  Cute place. A sweet little boutique (2nd hand)  sits attached and we dug that.  The purpose of the Gathering Grounds at MyHouse is amazing.  Every penny spent helps our local homeless teens.
12179,"Greatest Mediterranean restaurant in Alaska, what a great dinning experience, and the food was divine."
12180,"Fantastic customer service! We came in, told them what we were looking for, and they were such a great help and getting us what we needed! We will definitely be back in the future, and will definitely recommend this place to others!
Just a warning though, the guys next door don’t like anyone parking in their area and will threaten to tow you. So just be aware of where you park."
12181,For the devoted minimalist.
12182,This place is consistently good.  Everything I've tried is great.  I really like the pizzas.
12183,"Love this place. Soooo much better than ""The Shak"", better prices, better inventory and waaaay better customer service!!"
12184,JR and Mike will hook you up. They gave me my rewards that the Dowling store keeps forgetting to give me.
12185,Great food and customer service
12186,They make an EXCELLENT Americano. Bold and rich.
12187,Lovely ridgetop walking through birch forest. Would love to see these trails expanded. Check FNSB Borough website for trail maps as there is no map at trailhead.
12188,The parts I need
12189,"It felt like the chicken would have been better. A little dry and quite bland. I would expect this from my mom, not a place specialized in tried chicken. At least they get some decent ranch to drown it in."
12190,Best sushi in town along with the best price!!!
12191,"Generally the better grocery store in Alaska.
It is nice that they have updated to using pay by phone systems, but I have found that it only works about half the time. So bring your wallet 😉"
12192,Great coffee!
12193,"You don't go here for the amazing cuisine, you go here to melt back into the fabric of America. It's like going to Grandma's house. Standard american diner done right."
12194,"Amazing set up, great atmosphere, great family owned establishment. Would recommend anything on their menu it’s fantastic!! The lady who runs it is super kind."
12195,Palmer's best kept secret when it comes to Asian cuisine. The host is always polite and the food is always great. Don't let the motel scare you off.
12196,"Very inconsistent.

Three trips, three different experiences.

On one trip we ordered two of the same dish. One was delicious, and hot. The other was cold in the middle and hardly desirable.

First trip coffee was good( drip) second it was hardly warm and weak.

One of our dishes on our first visit had metal wire from a cleaning pad in it. ( However otherwise was delicious)

We did however both times receive amazing service and good Turkish coffee. I however will not be back next season for a third visit."
12197,Alaska USA atm machine
12198,I certainly had the most thrilling road trip of my life passing on the edge of the deep valley there. The panoramic view of the vast colorful wilderness is incredible and the passing buses provide a decent scale of how tiny we are compared to nature.
12199,This is a user friendly store.
12200,Whalesong is definitely one to see!
12201,Snobby owner looks down on non-regulars
12202,The same stuff everyone else carries just overpriced
12203,Always have seasonal deals on tires and staff is knowledgeable and good customer service.
12204,"Service was great, but the food options could have been a little better for our even.  Nonetheless, very pleased."
12205,Amazing place doing great things!
12206,I always stop here for breakfasts when I'm driving thru Homer. This place has the best staff and the best breakfast around. The prices are a bit high but due to the local and organic sources it is worth it. If you are in Homer and this place is open stop in for breakfast or at least grab something to go from their display case.
12207,Bought some entertainment furniture there was a good price on clearance nice people.
12208,Great place for events.
12209,"Dirty, food was alright though"
12210,"Clean store, friendly staff, has just about everything I need in one stop."
12211,Decent food. Decent service
12212,"Waitress was nice.
Way too long of a wait for mine and my husband's food. We ordered right before a table of 4 and they had eaten and left before our food came. We had to ask if it was coming.
The food was not good, unfortunately. For how they price their menu I expected more. The halibut fish and chips was distasteful.  The batter was thick which made the halibut taste off. We had waited so long for our food by the time we got it we were ready to leave.
My husband had the Mount St. Elias. He only had a few bites of it.
The salads were far too big for starters. Downsize the plate then you won't be wasting so much food.
Unfortunately we probably will not return."
12213,Average shop
12214,Great Customer service and good selection of products for hobby Farmers.
12215,"Wow! The place for breakfast that we found.  The pancakes were delicious as was the get reindeer sausage - my first time trying it.  The service is excellent,  the people are nice and there's a crowd of other patrons enjoying their meals."
12216,Great theater. Slow customer service for refreshments though.
12217,Pretty good place
12218,Great clean store
12219,"Great beer, food, and atmosphere"
12220,"the chicken is definitely delicious, a nice thin not too crunchy coating, over moist not slimy  chicken. the dipping sauce is quite good as well. the fries were meh in my opinion slightly under cooked but not bad. cole slaw was pretty standard but pretty good. definitely going back for more chicken!"
12221,Excellent
12222,Workers here must have been having an off day a few weeks back. Not the friendliest of people. Food was so-so. Not planning on returning to this location.
12223,"Beautiful location. Had some moose right there in the parking lot, haha. Trails were all over. Wish I had more time to hike."
12224,Love this place
12225,As someone who loves supporting local & minimizing the typical online shopping... They don't have what I need. :/ Otherwise great service & decent products.
12226,Busy drive through at lunch. Order with the app and go inside to pickup.
12227,"This shop belongs to Safeway, there are no local products at all. 4 stars for not having enough fish choice. In such place like Alaska I would expect more fish. We took last package of frozen pollock. And there was only frozen halibut left. There was choice of frozen shrimps. Big selection of meat. I understand that in such a remote place the food would be more expensive. For comparison..  1gallon of 2% milk is 6.29$, 12 eggs not organic 5.49$, bananas 1.79$, avocado 3.49 $/each. In general there is a big choice, not huge of course, also household items and kids toys.The stuff is nice and helpful. We were happy that we could buy food here."
12228,"Like family, took my kids in the workers smiled and were great"
12229,Great place to get automotive paints.  Customer service was fast and friendly.
12230,"Love my nails, and the herbal pedicure was so amazing! Loved it and will be coming back for sure ❤"
12231,Over the Rainbow has decided to discriminate against those with developmental and medical disabilities due to their inability to wear a mask. They have made choice to excluse a portion of society. I am thankful I found out before my daughter was embarrassed and turned away from the door of a toy store. I hope this helps others avoid the same scenario.
12232,The first dog we were looking at was adopted right out from under us. That said we found our tripod there!
12233,Good food and breakfast served all day 😀
12234,Very good they give a 10% discount for the local high school and military. They are always nice and service is quick!
12235,Jesse and Phil in parts very helpful guys. They know there stuff. Everytime i come back i get great with a big smile from front desk workers. I will go back everytime and support Local Alaska Business cuz they treat you like there own.
12236,"Ask for Kenn or Deb, they make it easy for you!"
12237,"Sushi was fresh and delicious, service was great!"
12238,"I hadn't been to Friday's in years and we went there for a business lunch. The food was great and service was good. Somehow a couple orders were messed up, but the server swiftly fixed the issue and brought out some extra food to make up for the mistake. I'll be going back with my family and friends in the future."
12239,These are as close as you can get to a true hoagie in the state of Alaska.
12240,"Lots of shopping, fast food, nearby art galleries, lots of nearby restaurants, and lots of Hotels nearby. And events should be posted online."
12241,Our favorite restaurant in town.
12242,This was a nice Cabela's but their stock was low in areas. I felt they are also hesitant to fill them out due to the amount of traffic expected as summer will start to end.
12243,Cleaner than the last time I was in the reception area. Though the chairs need replacing. New crew and manager and everyone was all smiles. The place needs some work.
12244,This place kept it 100%. Staff is fun and friendly. Selection is nice and the chicken...Good Lord the chicken is perfect. Missing out on this place would be a shame.
12245,Thing not price in wood area
12246,Best London fog in town
12247,Beautiful view!!
12248,Love this place
12249,"Beautiful place with amazing people who helped identify shrubs we have at the home we bought. They care for their products with such care and pride, buying from them is a win-win, especially since I don't have a green thumb :)"
12250,All ways helpful
12251,"Definitly my go to place when looking for tools, tarps and other goods. The prices are amazing. You owe it to yourself to check out thier huge inventory. I can almost guarantee once you have been here you will be back with so much stuff your sure to find something you have been needing but never got around to getting."
12252,A trove of beautiful and interesting things! I could spend all day here.
12253,Love this store
12254,Not many choices in nome.
12255,"The food was on point. Black pepper steak Steak was cooked how I requested and the spicy sauce on top was amazing. The king crab Poppers were fantastic dipped in the cream cheese, jalapeno, lime dip. The halibut was awsome when my buddy let me take a bite."
12256,"Great place to enjoy a great pizza, great beer, and a great movie."
12257,Ok place
12258,"Great coffee, company and dog friendly!"
12259,Beautiful Park with excellent walking trails and an awesome playground for children. Great views of the Kenai River.
12260,"The server was friendly, the peach tea was tasted good and the steak was done just right."
12261,Awesome for the kids
12262,"Costco tire center lost my tires twice, they never called to tell me the re order came in. Made a appointment to get them put on and they said all day for the wait AFTER I drove in for my appointment. Costco tire center is a joke, go to TDI."
12263,Only place to buy tires. No weird sales gimmicks just good honest people with Quality Tires
12264,Nice place to relax in the outdoors.
12265,"Everything you need for fishing, boat repairs, home improvement, and houswares."
12266,Really nice inside
12267,Fantastic Chiropractor and great staff. I always had a headache after neck adjustments but had no problems this time around. And took away almost all the pain I'd had in my foot from falling and twisting my ankle.
12268,Quick cheap gas the fuel didn't go as far per tank in my car though
12269,Incrediblely fun i reccomend for a date or a family day out ♡♡ the animals are well taken care of and the docile friendly attitudes reflect it the show offs ♡♡♡
12270,The museum is so well done! Exhibits for all ages and interest levels. We cannot wait to go back!
12271,"Food is great. Order then sit down kinda place. Fast and cheap. Loses a star for me because they don't have a liquor license for margaritas. If you don't want one, this is the place to go!"
12272,Good food but kinda pricey
12273,"Price is good for many of the meats and staples. Since arriving in Alaska we grocery shop here, at Costco, and Carrs to get the most value."
12274,I have never seen a crew work so slowly. I am reasonably certain the counter person has been indulging in marijuana.    Food was fine but the wait was terrible.
12275,Love the Coco Prawns for a quick bite to eat with a draft beer or hard cider!
12276,Fast
12277,It's not my favorite place to dine at. Nothing wrong with it really... I was there just to meet somebod after I finish some business nearby. It's good for kids I suppose and there is a McDonald's Playland on the lake Otis side of it. It's attached to a convenience store and that is unusual and kind of cool.
12278,Awesome dive bar one pool table and a long bar covering have the room. Beers on tap as well as a wide selection of liquor. Pull tabs and great bartender who can keep a great conversation going for hours.
12279,Must've been out fishing. Can always see wildlife in the Tongass :)
12280,Great food
12281,"The food bank provides free lunches, commodities, and emergency assistance."
12282,Nice store for camping clothes but it seems overpriced not sure about thatin my opinion there are better in-store programs around town though
12283,"Nice staff, very helpful, wide assortment of furniture"
12284,Great food and services.
12285,Love this place!  Excellent service and great  spiced chai!  Thank you!!
12286,Very friendly staff. Had a great atmosphere for treating yourself.
12287,"Good food, decent price range, friendly and attentive staff, needed a special order and they were able to handle it easily and without a fuss."
12288,Felt it needed a fresh coat of paint.
12289,Great serivce typical anglo Mexican place
12290,"If you're looking for a camera and camera accessories then you need to visit Stewart's Photo Shop.  I'm almost positive that Stewart's Photo Shop is the only dedicated camera store in Anchorage, Alaska.  The employees are photographers, so they most likely have answers to your questions and suggestions for visitors to Alaska.  The return policy is limited to 10 days with receipt and the items must be unused in the original box.  If you need it now then visit Stewart's Photo Shop today.

Bring quarters because the street parking isn't free on the weekdays."
12291,"Were given the key to our room and when we opened the door and walked in we discovered it was already being used by other people = not a good experience.  Staff was friendly enough, gave us another room.  Room was large but outdated and not that clean, bathroom plumbing didn't work well at all and found a questionable bug I killed.  Would NOT stay here again.  Would NOT recommend it to others.  We left at 2am so did not stay the whole night or get breakfast."
12292,I had the Donna's Burger and fries it was delicious. I'm definitely going to be eating their burgers over McDonald's anytime.
12293,Great vet
12294,"Great coffee, service and atmosphere."
12295,"Great place for family and children, staff is kind and easy going, wheelchair accessible! And they have a private family/handicap bathroom!"
12296,Great location. Atmosphere is nice. I would love to go back during the winter for the Aurora viewing
12297,Great people
12298,Just not a fan
12299,Staff was both knowledgeable and seemed to genuinely  care. We appreciated their attention to detail and recommendations. Petr is truly a skilled artist!
12300,Awesome shop
12301,"Ate breakfast 3 mornings at the Bake Shop. Good coffee, great omelettes, potatoes and friendly local favorite."
12302,"JJ and Mikey contacted me before their scheduled appointment to let me know they we en route. When they arrived, they both were extremely friendly and respectful. They helped remove everything I had listed quickly."
12303,Fantastic food and amazing pies
12304,"Not very welcoming from the outside, very many vehicles with people sleeping in them in the parking lot. Very noisy in the lot at night can hear it from my room."
12305,Great place
12306,Costco is the best.
12307,"Second time I have used them and both times very happy with the speed of service and quality of work. They weren't the cheapest place to get a set of Cooper tires, but they had them in stock."
12308,Never seems to have what I need in stock and prices always seem to be higher than competition.
12309,"Had a good stay. There was a problem with the septic system. The owners got right to work to fix it. Beautiful views of inlet. Bald eagles soaring overhead, watch those little pets."
12310,"Seems a little worn out, not much activity."
12311,Great theatre and excellent production Silent Skies!
12312,Come early and bring cash for payment.  Good food.
12313,Always good food.
12314,Worked on our car super fast and adjusted to our accommodations
12315,The food is always amazing.
12316,Pretty pricey. They always have a good assortment of all kinda of cards
12317,Very beautiful
12318,Solid crew great to work with
12319,"Like the chairs, they have heat for your lower back. Nice way to watch a movie."
12320,Meh downstairs is great upstairs is not the best
12321,"Easy to find location next to the Ford dealership. Clean comfortable rooms. Great continental breakfast with hot eggs and breakfast meats. Also waffles,  cereals, yogurt, and fruit. They also have a small workout room, pool, and hot tub."
12322,Always an entertaining time at Fresh Water Spring!
12323,"Great Catholic parish. (Full disclosure - I started as a parishioner and volunteer, now I also work there.) ""All are welcome"" is our motto, and how we live and worship. Very active in community programs, large and active Alaska Native, Samoan and Filipino communities. Second oldest Catholic parish in Anchorage. A true blessing, we celebrate God's love and the Gospel message of mercy and salvation (sorry, if you want hellfire and brimstone, you'll want to look elsewhere!)"
12324,The staff in the body shop office were extremely friendly and very professional. I was kept up-to-date on the progress of my vehicle and it was done in a very timely manner.
12325,Pizza and beer are great. The staff member who served my table was amazing.
12326,"Great service, reasonably priced. Excellent."
12327,"Different to what I'm used to, but definitely delicious!"
12328,One of our favorite shops to visit on the weekends.
12329,There is a whole aisle of just candy!
12330,Really great service. all the employees are friendly to customers and eachother. food is great. and really fair pricing for the servings.
12331,"The employees were nice enough and I'm always happy for new things to try, but overall I had to give it a low rating due to taste. The ice cream tastes like they bought dipping dots and just squished the dots, rolled it flat and re-served it to me. The topping choices they put in their signature creations are just weird and do nothing for the flavor. Mine came with fruit loops, Pocky sticks and a whole oreo shoved on top. I'd prefer cold stone for a similar price but larger servings and better taste."
12332,I find that I prefer to order to go from. Bella Vista verses going there to eat.  Their Pizza and pasta are great.
12333,Mall is cool
12334,Good jeans that fit well.
12335,"My favorite sushi spot in town, hands down. The staff is friendly, the food is nearly perfect, and the rolls are creative and attractive. I have never waited for seating and always feel welcome."
12336,"This store really has a little bit of everything. There is a lot of fabrics and everything that goes with sewing, along with sewing machines, different types of threads, needles, scissors, you name it they probably have it. There are so many hobby items, from cake decorating to making floral arrangements, jewelry making supplies, some wood working supplies, picture framing, just so many items you can spend a lot of time looking around at and wish you had the time to try them all."
12337,Clean
12338,"We visited this coffee shop around breakfast, and though the food options were limited, the veggie burritos we got were very good and so were the muffins and the frittata.
The coffee was pretty nice as well, and we particularly liked the decor. It seemed like it wouldn't be out of place as a Brooklyn coffee shop"
12339,9/10 times it's great food. Service is always a bit show but the food makes up for it.
12340,Lots of ducks and geese which is good but the bird poo is unavoidable in some areas.
12341,The Best Donuts I've Ever Had! Seriously! Vegan Donuts At That!!! What Else Could I Ask For!
12342,Love xalos!
12343,Nachos and fries were awesome after a day of riding. The portions are generous. It was clean. Waiter didn't seem like he cared for his job but was pleasant enough. He was prompt and checked on us frequently.
12344,Have all the fishing gear and supplies the person could ever imagine. We stopped to get dip netting poles for the Copper River.
12345,Fun staff.  Only downfall is the lines.  You guys should seriously consider adding a second lane and more staff.
12346,Simply the BEST!
12347,Friendly but   quoted one price then  charged other and couldn't  credit my card
12348,"My absolute favorite bar in town. Awesome crowd, even better bartenders."
12349,Best chocolate milkshakes ever
12350,"Great park for camping. There are hiking trails, river access, covered picnic tables, and a great bike park"
12351,"The food and atmosphere is fantastic! We sat outside and the sun was shining and the views of the mountains were spectacular that day. The philly I probably would not order again at $18 it's all out the bread if the bread isn't great don't want it. But, their burgers are awesome and the buns are nice they look homemade! The fries were good. Drank a lemonade but they also have tons of on tap beer selections!👍"
12352,Old school pizza
12353,"Small store, much higher than loser 48"
12354,I love my white chocolate mocha
12355,"Clean and fast, just can't get the orders right. 😑"
12356,Good
12357,Easily the nicest Walmart I've ever been in
12358,"Cool, cozy spot that has the BOMB biscuits & gravy!"
12359,Beautiful
12360,Beautiful parks
12361,"The Extreme Fun Center was great fun, my kid asked to spend two days of our vacation here and she LOVED it. The staff across the board was the best, so nice and helpful. It's a must visit when in Anchorage for my family."
12362,Poor job preaching car!
12363,Bad gas
12364,"A really neat place to visit in Fairbanks, Alaska"
12365,Comfy store nice employees decent prices
12366,I have used Sunshine Rae multiple times over the past year. I've been very happy with the speed of their service and their prices. I also don't feel like they are trying to upsell me when I go to them for a vehicle repair. They also recently started using a computer system that sends convenient notifications and lets you to do work authorizations and payments online. This makes the process even more streamlined. Highly recommend this shop.
12367,"On larger orders check the details of each sandwich. They were quick, but they didn't put cheese on most of our sandwiches."
12368,Good beer
12369,They just remodeled and updated the exterior and interior. Food is of good quality.
12370,"(Translated by Google) Good site. Good attention although a little slow.

(Original)
Buen sitio. Buena atención aunque un poco lenta."
12371,Pretty standard sports bar.  Decent food. Good beer selection.
12372,I liked the people running our tour.it was a great learning experience.
12373,Good food and good atmosphere but not the friendliest staff.
12374,"Excellent service, phenomenal salsa, and tastey food! I highly recommend this place!"
12375,"Good views, reasonably priced, military discount. Close to all the bars and restaurants in downtown"
12376,"Love this place! They have super good little mini cannolis and everything I've had there has been good, staff are always happy and pleasant"
12377,Amazing ice cream shop! Great homemade flavors. A MUST do if you're visiting Anchorage. Flavors change often and they allow taste testing before buying. Homemade waffle cones are the best tasting cone I've had. Reasonably priced for this amazing hand crafted product. Definitely coming back often. Do prepare for a line. Lines are typically 20-30+ minutes wait. Definitely worth the wait!
12378,All bears love 3 bears.  Dug.
12379,"You can find any and everything you need here. Even the food is very good
I love going there."
12380,Very knowledgable doctors and staff.  Efficient and welcoming.

12382,"Food and coffee are good, cash only atm inside"
12383,Got food in 5 minutes but it was all wrong and cold. I can't figure out how they managed to bring out cold food 5 minites after we ordered.
12384,"I like these guys and the nice lady at the counter. They have reasonable prices, fast service and great location. They are my go to when I have a vehicle issue."
12385,Good product for the price
12386,Good eats all day at any time . Menu very good.
12387,Good selection and people are happy there!
12388,"Meh. Food was average. And they didn't open my windows so it felt like 85* inside. Very crowded, the tables were just too close together it made you feel like you were bumping into people sitting nearby or Ewing by every two seconds. I got the burger with chicken tender on it and it just didn't have any flavor. I'd pick somewhere else if you can."
12389,beautiful place.
12390,Was looking for something Late night which was a must have.  And of course I found it.
12391,The bar was a tad bit squished but I expected that on A Friday night. The drinks were amazing the appetizers were a disappointment for size for taste they were delicious and creative.
12392,Love the Asian chicken salad here.
12393,It needs to better it's self
12394,Loved it.!
12395,"It tasted like water down coffee, didn't have the right mixture of flavors that I asked for n the 2nd coffee didn't taste like a vanilla latte as well. Don't know if they just have the right amount of espresso coffee. Not going back there."
12396,Tasty tasty prime rib
12397,"(Translated by Google) Good supermarket They have everything.

(Original)
Buen supermercado. Tienen de todo."

12400,Salt of the Earth... rad place
12401,Found everything I wanted.
12402,"We disembarked here from our 7 day Alaskan Cruise with Celebrity Cruises to start our 5 day land tour and found the disembarkation process easy. First, the staff on the ship kept us informed until we had to leave and when we got off the ship ramp, there were buses labelled and waiting for us where the bus driver verified us and welcomed us."
12403,"great selection they are always very knowledgeable about what they have they have everything from flower, oil, vaps, and edibles."
12404,The food and service were both really good.
12405,The bar was excellent... They had a band playing that night as well but the band only played like five songs a set and had a lot of dead air time in between songs.... It was the Ken something band...
12406,Typically the best shopping experience in Anchorage.
12407,Has it all
12408,Ultimate store for anything
12409,"Been going there for all my tire needs for 10years always good service, and great prices."
12410,Very good breakfast burritos friendly staff!
12411,"Outstanding food! My wife had the halibut sandwich. I had the halibut fish and chips, portions could have been better, but still, great great food."
12412,Love this park!
12413,Love it!
12414,"Very surprised... I went into this place on a very slow sunday night. Almost as a last resort because I was quite looking for such a large spot. My group had an enjoyable experience here. They were very friendly, made us some very delicious drinks, invited us to play pool upstairs. We will definitely be returning. 🙂"
12415,Everything you could possibility want.
12416,"This place does a great job, even with what I'm sure is a crazy workload. Remember to spay and neuter your pets."
12417,Great little used bookstore with unbelievably affordable books and proceeds support local literacy.
12418,"(Translated by Google) Delicious ""maet lover"" breakfast

(Original)
Riquísimo desayuno ""maet lover"""
12419,"Awful experience. Our room smelled like a combination of wet cigarette and stinky feet while the lobby had an overpowering aroma of cheap air fresheners. The cleanliness was also lacking in the bathroom area, including hair left in the shower. The room just had an overall cheap, dirty feel. Thank God our stay was only one night - we couldn't wait to get out of there."
12420,Nice statue
12421,I think Dimond Center is a bit better mall but this place is also nice.
12422,Staff was friendly and knowledgeable of the area. The food was prepared well.
12423,"The bowling ally itself is nice and the price is great on Tuesdays but we ran into a few issues and didn't have to great of an experience.
First we waited till 9 for the better price but the guy didn't give it to us because they decided to not do it till 930 even though online said 9. So we waited.
We purchased 2 games for each of us and they stopped it in the middle of our second game and said we had to pay more, then they said we had to show them receipts that they never gave us, so I recommend getting a receipt every time.
It was mostly a hassle and we just wanted to pay and play.
Its really too bad because I don't want to go back die to how a lot of the fun was taken away from our experience, I'd rather try a different ally then go back here.
I hope the best for this allies success, I recommend better policies and sticking with the website or updating the website so that prices aren't confusing.
For customers I recommend checking the website and what's getting rung up, as well as asking for all receipts."
12424,"Wish we had checked the reviews prior to starting the laundry journey here. Washers work ok, but the dryers basically don’t work, and the owner stated that he is not fixing the machines because “the Canadians keep breaking them”, apparently by using Canadian quarters. However, even when the regular dryers are running, they do not dry things. The big dryer does work, but they use it basically 100% of the time for their laundry service. After quite a bit of arguing, we did get the owner to give us some time in the big dryer. Bonus: For excitement, look above the big dryer when running to see big flames!"
12425,Excellent food and service!  There homemade pies would make grandma jealous.  The drive and view are just as unbelievable. Make the drive to Eureka Lodge now.
12426,"Just ate here again.  Both the Burgers and the fish and chips were great.  Plus, they had Chili Lima Cholula, which...is...AWESOME"
12427,Food made me sick to my stomach.
12428,"Warm and friendly, best espresso in Anchorage."
12429,"Good burger, will make you fat"
12430,Why does your stuff always fall apart after warranty? You dont value your customers and your products are so cheap they fall apart in the first year?
12431,Wedding party of 18 (automatic gratuity / taken for granted). SG works harder when gratuity is not automatic. We had a MUCH better food and service experience at Double Musky Inn.
12432,Best place in town for a Reuben sandwich
12433,Ok
12434,Love the breakfast
12435,Love this place. If you are visiting this is a must see attraction.

12438,Great views of Denali
12439,A nice place.  I left your car keys at the Trooper post.
12440,"You always know what you're getting here.   A little greasy and sloppy food (and wouldn't have it any other way) served while being surrounded by aged patrons looking at the seniors menu!   It's always great for stories overheard, a great breakfast menu, and for some delicious pies too!   Their location was rumored to be in limbo with the recent plans to expand the adjacent Glenn Highway."
12441,Great food an friendly service
12442,Great selection of cold weather gear and good pricing
12443,Nice place. Too many people.  Keep your valuables hidden

12446,"Thanks for taking care of me on short notice, I was in and out quickly.  Great service."
12447,"Not my type of food, but we were there for a family birthday. Despite being a small place, they easily accommodated our largish group. My food was flavorful and cooked well. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Biggest down side was them being out of several items. Very reasonably priced."
12448,These guys are so awesome because one of them changed some tail lights for me.
12449,Very nice
12450,Such amazing flavors in every dish!!!!
12451,Great place for the kids.

12462,"The Alaska State Fair never fails to thrill me! The fun, foos, rides, and animals combine to make a day that is usual my families favorite all year!"
12463,Had an amazing mother/daughter day at the mall!
12464,"Excellent customer service, and the chow was amazing, as always."
12465,Friendly staff.
12466,Centrally located and easy access for ice cream :)
12467,My go to place for any fasteners.  Best prices in town!
12468,"Ask for Danny, he's kind and puts on a good show but also cooks the food perfectly (chicken, rice, and vegetables), which isn't always the combination you get when sitting to see a show rather than the lounge. The lounge is comfortable and clean though, and food seems to come quicker than if you want a show."
12469,Good people here. They went the extra mile.
12470,Clean. Seating. Vending and pop machines.
12471,The service department truly went above and beyond for me! Bu and his crew provided above par service at a fair rate; something rarely found in the industry.  I highly recommend Kendall VW!! AAA++
12472,"They gladly accommodated our family of 10. We shared all of our dishes, and they helped with the plate situation. Food was so good! This was our third time, and we will be back again for sure!"
12473,"Portions are great,  service is wonderful, good is consistently amazing! It's our go to ""Chinese food"" place since moving here over a year ago!"
12474,Great little ice cream joint with a lot of different flavors to choose from.
12475,"Nice lil hike with option to view the waterfall from a viewing platform or from the lower creek trail.  Be sure to bring mosquito repellent,  myself and my daughter got tore up!"
12476,"How can you not like dinner, movie and beer all at one time.  World famous pizza and beer to die for."
12477,Sandra is AMAZING!!!!!!
12478,Its a nice place.
12479,"I've never understood the prevalence of places like this in Fairbanks, I just don't like coffee kiosks, but as far as they go, Mocha Dan's is the best. Very kind, quicker than most and lots of options."
12480,Provides craft options and materials
12481,Calamari was delicious. The Seafood pasta was good. Wish there was more seafood.
12482,Great sales and customer service 👍
12483,"Staff doesn't wear masks properly.  Very helpful in selecting a product, and gave good advice about installation and correct use of same."
12484,"Their rates are expensive, though it is something that can be fitted into a budget once a quarter if you are frugal."
12485,Fries are amazing and there is a great beer selection. Side note for non meat eaters: almost every dish has meat in it.
12486,"Great trip.  Good food, great staff and lots of wildlife."
12487,It is Mcdonalds you like it or you do not.
12488,"Had staff on-site.  Warm soapy water for spot scrub.  Equipment functioned properly, but couldn't purchase a sham for drying."
12489,Since it's become foodland the prices are much better. They have really good produce.
12490,"If I could rate a 0 I would.  First of all, this post office lost a very important peice of mail about a year ago that caused a lot of stress and issues that didn't need to happen in the first place. Second, my mail carrier must not know how to read numbers.  My mail never ends up in the correct box and my packages get lost or always get sent to my neighbor.  And never the same neighbor.  I've  emailed and call and even went in to the post office and they can care less."
12491,Very helpful place
12492,Very good found what I need it.
12493,Great pizza
12494,"Large, hearty portions of steaming hot noodles. Small dining room. Fair price, especially considering the bowls are big enough to share. Pay attention to the heat rating...spicy means SPICY here. My daughter found out the hard way and found her Kimchi Ramen too intense. The gracious server offered to remake as a non-spicy dish without an extra charge, and they let us keep both. (By the way, this is not to say the Kimchi Ramen was anything less than delicious!)

This is the sort of business that everyone should cheer for but not enough people do. Small, local, authentic, and really good. Yet the telltale signs of financial struggle are present. It's a vibe you get that maybe the place won't be open much longer. It'll be sad if that proves true."
12495,Pricey but excellent food!
12496,"Good option for pizza and beer, hard to describe but it tastes like most like fresh made pizza in the state."
12497,"The woman at this store is so uneducated about fish. (Older with white hair, I'm noticing other reviews mention the same woman)

1st experience she rolled her eyes and told us it takes 6 months to set up a salt water tank and if it is our first tank we shouldn't attempt it.  We left that day and went to a specialty fish store who laughed at the statement and were very dissapointed she would discourage new people.

2nd experience she first claimed it was impossible to put female bettas together (youtube betta sorority tank, it is a thing) she refused to sell 4 female bettas.  She claims the store attempted this and within a day only 1 survived.... Last time we go to this store for fish...  alaska fish and coral will now be our only fish store!

Update! After 2 weeks I have 4 female Bettas that I purchased from Alaska Fish and Coral.
They are all getting along in my tank with a male betta as well.  They are not stressed or fighting.  I hope the lady that works there becomes more educated."
12498,Great food even for my gluten free girl 🤗
12499,Great sports bar with good bartenders. Only place in town with Guiness on tap.
12500,"Normally great, if you manage to get seated. Long waits are common."
12501,Really over priced
12502,"Can be slow and food semi cold and even when you request fresh hot fries,  they arent"

12508,Good food just disappointed that they don't get their corn taco shells.
12509,"Awesome, recommended stop! Large portions served!"
12510,I depend AutoZone to have everything I need. They're always helpful and know or get help to guide us to make sure we receive the right parts or otherwise.
12511,"Love subway, but didnt love the little blonde that told me i cant have avocado on my slider cause it costs more and she didnt know how to ring it up. Pretty sad."
12512,"Girl this place is amazing! Best hot dog I've ever had. Literally I want to go back and get more. I can't tho, cuz im so full from ONE hot dog. They are huge and packed! I got a Chicago dog and omgggg. Please go here. They aren't regular shmegular hot dogs."
12513,Have to watch receipt they don't put discount a lot of times
12514,Wow fishing
12515,"My friend owns a cabin right down the street from this cafe. They always talks about how good it is. They let us go up to the cabin and spend some time. We decided to try the cafe, and it was really good. It was too busy for pizza, the weight was too long. So we got sandwiches and fries, they were all good. It's a nice little gem! And the staff is truly friendly."
12516,great hotel.. sleeping is a little hard for those who mind traffic noise.
12517,Awesome helicopter trip to Mendenhall glacier. Once in a lifetime
12518,Love the food
12519,I miss going here just to watch the view and think about my next step in life. Never had anyone that wanted to go with me and mean it.
12520,Scrumptious. Decadent. Goodness
12521,This place never disappoints! Great pizza and beer options. Love their unique pizza toppings - if you're feeling adventurous try the Greek gyro pizza.
12522,Dirty and grungy. Definitely shows its age. Large homeless population hang out at intersection and in front and rear entrances
12523,It's okay! 😁
12524,"Awesome!
One stop shop for your house improvements."
12525,Not a nice group. No business from me.

12535,Service was slow and disorganized.
12536,"I went here for lunch at the recommendation of a customer while I was working in meadow lakes, the food was ok, but the daytime regulars were amazing. Lunch was quite entertaining."
12537,Nice atmosphere and decent beer. Didn't have the food so I can't comment on that.
12538,Really friendly staff and good prices and selection!
12539,"This rather unique store in my opinion is a hidden gem offering handmade crafts made by local artists, they use bone, antler and fossil materials. For those wishing to comb thru these treasures and perhaps obtain some of this type of art i would make this shop a must!"
12540,I didn't see any problems
12541,The selection of spices and tea here is mind blowing.
12542,"Fairly convenient to get to right off of the Glenn Highway, they have competitive pricing for the surrounding area, and sometimes even cheaper. They have windshield washing buckets for your use which is very much appreciated. They keep the area clean."
12543,Fresh food. 24 hours!!
12544,Dave and busters
12545,Best hobby shop in Alaska
12546,Nice park along a trail and there is access to the water

12548,"(Translated by Google) I like it because I already have 13 years of being with AT&T

12553,Wonderful fast service and very nice employees
12554,Really good advice and service  they also feature bud from A.C.C. which is always primo .
12555,Great pho and other Vietnamese food.
12556,Cmon really its wendys
12557,No knowledge of what they had on hand. Locating items needed tracked me from one side and back to the other again.
12558,Great and flavorful food!
12559,"It's food, guns, booze, and toilet paper.  What more do you need?"
12560,"Upgraded to the buffalo fries, which was the saving grace of the meal  - 100% worth the extra $3. Wife had the patty melt. Meat was unseasoned, the bread had more flavor. My porterhouse burger was little better. Pretty high prices, but the atmosphere is nice. Warning: not a fluffy friendly establishment. Booth seats are narrow and the tables cant be moved. The bar has high wooden seats. Service overall was decent."
12561,Always a long wait but very nice people.
12562,Great congregation love this church when I lived in the area
12563,It's great haircut for the price
12564,A lil pricey but a great selection.

12568,Beat bakery in town!
12569,Nice cute lil airport. You do have to pay for more than 15 minute parking tho so that sucks
12570,Educational programs for children
12571,My burger was good the fries are not my style but the desserts are what they should lead with . The service was ok although mine and my friends orders were served up wrong even with the cashier repeating our orders back correctly first. I'd still eat here if I wanted a good burger.
12572,Awesome products. Friendly and knowledgeable staff.
12573,"Great diner-inspired food, pricing is all over the place though"
12574,Expensive but good. Loved the crab

Excelente comida"
12582,Was great there also took some senior pictures as well in all was a fantastic time to walk there for a bit.
12583,"It's an upscale place but if you have the budget, you can get beautiful things here. In addition to Alaska-hardened trees and shrubs, they'll store your hanging fuschia etc. baskets for a fee over the winter. When you get them back,  they'll be stunning. I bought perennial herbs for $6/4""-pot and am eyeing some zone 3 fruit trees at $80/$90 a piece for 5-6 foot tall trees. 3-4 for lilacs were $36.
There is an extensive home and gift shop where you can buy Company C rugs, Creuset kitchenware and other high-end stuff."
12584,Best Hawaiian food in Alaska!
12585,This is one of the best pizzerias in Anchorage. It is smaller and quieter than most but the pizza is great.
12586,Great food and service was awesome
12587,The staff was incredible! Needed med refill for our dog while in town on vacation- they went out of our way to get us what we needed. Thank you so very much!!
12588,Nicely maintained Walmart
12589,Beautiful place
12590,Overpriced ice cream which tastes just ok and tend to be slow service.
12591,My son (5) & daughter (2) love it! Run around until they are about to pass out. They even have a spot for my infant (6 mo) to play!
12592,Excellent presentation and exciting to see the dogs and their people.
12593,"Great customer service, clean store, awesome product with ridiculously low prices! Best prices in the valley! I will be returning to this store because the low prices and rewards program. Also the product was super fresh they had many different strains of the herb. I was very impressed my first time trying this despensery!!"

12605,Cuz it's cheap fat people food and I'm a fatty at heart
12606,"Starbucks is Starbucks, same old same old....."
12607,Small town original feel. Everything you may  expect when passing through a town. Went in to dig up a little extra info for admiring the sorrounding area. Ladies at the bar were very helpful and generous as well. Locals were friendly too. Food and beer were also on point. Defintely stop by if you are near.
12608,This might be the best park ever
12609,Great mall! This is the place to come if you need new clothes.
12610,Typical mobile home park.
12611,Very beautiful and a must do when your on the island. Very clean

12613,Good quick stop shop

The Cartee Fields have a total of 6 softball fields; 1-4 are located around the green Cartee Complex and 5-6 are located south near Debarr Road.  No dogs are allowed at the softball fields.  Parking can be found all over the area, but don't park in front of the portable toilets!

12617,"My all time favorite. Amazing variety of food from gourmet to bargain brand. Great sales and discounts. Always clean and well stocked. But most of all, great customer service.

12627,"It gets really crowded, but I usually find what I need and the service is okay."
12628,The greatest waitress! Love to share their lives with you and their love of their customers! Goid food too!
12629,Would have liked it better if our waiter told us that gratuity was included for 7 people before we already tipped him $40 extra or even said something after the fact.  Granted it's our fault for not double checking but come on!! You always tell your tables that they're better grat'd.
12630,Love it here. Employee's are always so helpful
12631,One of the best social drinking experience for a brewery in the valley!  Wish there was a larger outdoor area!
12632,Love the farmers market tuesdays

12636,"You can get your clothes washed here. Showers, nice selection of machines, fast dryers."
12637,"Edit- I got the Check Engine light to turn off by tightening the oil thingy and the gas cap was loose (it wasn’t loose before so I’m not sure why it was loose after the oil change).  I also fixed the glove box so it stayed closed.

I got my oil changed on the 24th.  My glove box fell open later that day and I ended up having to fix it, they changed my in cabin air filter and it’s under the glove box.  They didn’t put the drawer back correctly.  Now my check engine light is on, all they were supposed to do is a simple oil change, now I have to bring my car in to the dealership to find out why there is now something wrong with the engine."
12638,"Quick, clean, and so far the best my nails have looked after trying many different nail salons."

12687,We were served by a pick haired girl who's hair was flying everywhere. I thought it might be nice to see a hair net between her hair and my food. Other then that its fast food as expected.
12688,We had a great time watching opening night of Spamalot
12689,"The food is only ok, but it reminded our family of the Islands so it was endearing to us. The music and atmosphere really made the place feel authentic.

The shoyu poké is delicious and I'm a huge fan. I've never liked raw fish of any kind and I dislike tuna, but I can tear up this poké.

The kalhua pork was very good, but I'd prefer a side of sauce, teriyaki or barbecue, to come along with it.

The chicken katsu was a hit with the kids.

They let us sub out the macaroni salads for another scoop of rice.

The teriyaki beef was a little tough, but it tasted good.

The kalbi beef ribs were very good.

We'll be back, for sure! Gotta get more of that poké!"
12690,Good pizza prices.
12691,"Great service, an great buds"

12696,First come first serve.  I love it!  Accurate time waiting estimate and a superior product. My Nokian Tyres are great.
12697,A great furniture store and they have a lot of great options for you to beautify your home. I would recommend them heavily for your furnishing needs.
12698,So peaceful and serene...my wife and I were there on a sunny day and we both agree that even on the rainiest day this place would be precious!
12699,It has all I need. I can meet a friend for coffe or lunch. Pretty clean. Alot of seniors today...Tuesday.
12700,The octopus was amazing just wish it came with more.
12701,Friendly people and quick
12702,Lots of good deals here
12703,"Love this place.  Super fast.  Didn't even have to get out of my car.  Very friendly,  knowledgeable,  and professional. This was my second time dealing with them.  Rather use them than the DMV.   Highly recommended."
12704,Great place to go for ALL your trailer needs! From hitches for pulling to lighting kits for home made trailers. Access from highway can be tricky but lots of parking.
12705,Very delicious but expensive
12706,Great place to learn about sled dogs and racing
12707,Love this place and the people that work here. One guy in particular is named Clarence and he is an awesome dude with wonderful customer service! That guy needs a raise!
12708,Nothing special
12709,Absolutely fantastic service and amazing prices. Took the family of 6 to dinner for 50 bucks. The cheese curds were so delicious I almost got another basket.  Definitely worth a try.
12710,The food is great and friendly staff
12711,"We go weekly, nice place. Italian Sodas are hit or miss, sometimes great, but often kind of blah.

Nice assortment of pastries."
12712,"I am a cardholder of 18 years before legal cannabis as far as purchasing here again most likely won't, because of the fuzzy monkey brand! This brand has workers who have wore perfume and or after shave in the growing room!!! When it tastes like perfume that is what it is. Anyone knows that has removed some from a purse and had that taste!!!"
12713,"Nice bar, live music, tasty food. It's a little bit pricy, but it's in Downtown."
12714,Love this place
12715,This place has the best ice cream in town!
12716,Great atmosphere and bar tenders are awesome..  Stopped in for a happy hour drink and can't wait to go back!
12717,"I don't love this place it's just a Walmart, thank you for existing"
12718,Cute little shop that's been there forever. Only down was being treated like I didn't know what I was talking about.

12720,This is my all time favorite fast food burger joint getvthat beaconator
12721,Grear and fun place to stay and very kind people
12722,Great as always!
12723,"I’ve been here twice but honestly I should make it more. Food is always delicious and the staff are nice. If you’re a fan of chowder try the salmon chowder, you will not be disappointed."
12724,Food was good and fresh not as flavorful as some of the other similar restaraunts in town. Service was super slow considering how little people were there when we arrived.
12725,They have what you need
12726,Great customer service and the price is unbeatable iv recommended everyone I talk to comes to these guys.
12727,"Pizza is always the same, perfectly cooked and delicious. Personally I'd like more seasonal beers to be Belgium/wheat rather than pilsner or tripel"
12728,"Chena Hot Springs Resort is an excellent place to go, to unwind, to hike, to just plain experience.
You will not be disappointed.
Go visit, and maybe plan a several days' stay. There is so much to experience at the Resort.
There is a restaurant/gift shop. The food is top notch. Warning: The big bowl of clam chowder is gigantic, you may just want the bowl, rather than the big bowl. It was super-delicious, but way too big to get half-way through.
There is an ""ice castle"", the hot springs, that you can soak in, hiking trails, a duck and moose pond, and most likely much more that I missed.
Go check it out, you won't be disappointed. Well worth the time and effort to visit."
12729,The new card system is hard. Talk about kids learning to use plastic. I had to follow my kid around the whole time so he didn't credit up the machines and leave.
12730,Dr. Cha is an amazing dentist and his assistant clairabelle was beyond an amazing person also i would definately recommend patients here all of the staff are very pleasant.
12731,"Its open late, Merica faves"
12732,Needed a new water heater and repair work for furnace. This company has great people working for them. Always comfortable around the workers in my house. James' work looks like gold. *Edit. Reggie was the first to see all and let me know what needed to get done for inspection. Thank you guys
12733,Sonic milk shakes so good glad to have one in Fairbanks and the lines not to long like when it first opened
12734,Gorgeous
12735,"Such a beautiful and peaceful place where you can rent cabins, go canoing, or paddle boating. You get a nice workout with the paddle boats as you enjoy the view. All at a great price."
12736,Sooooo good. Best in town
12737,"Clean friendly place, and they really stepped up their printed t-shirt game!"
12738,"Operated by just a man and his wife, it seemed, they offer a limited menu of fried fish but they do those well. We had the halibut chowder and the fried Halibut, both of which were good. If you catch fish, they'll fry your fish for you at some charge"
12739,"Running out of swords, maybe time for something in its place."
12740,Easy access
12741,"Parked my car, was walking towards the noodle house and people from around here know that big daddies bbq is across the street. All i smelled was delicious bbq and i was questioning my decision​ to eat at the noodle house. Anyways ordered thai iced tea and the chicken panange and my order came barely 5 minutes later. Everything was very delicous and I don't regret my decision to go to the Noodle House."
12742,Great products. Great prices.
12743,"I loved the atmosphere and the smugness of the place. We saw an episode on a food channel that went to Alaskan venues. So we finally made it there. We are from Ohio and had  heard all the rumors and yes, They were right!
Great service, staff was very courteous,  the food was great! Total satisfaction.
We will return!!!"
12744,Such a great time here at Get Air. I'm 29 years old and still had an absolute ball. I found it to be a bit pricey but I would recommend looking at Groupon and other coupons that Get Air puts out and plan your trip accordingly. It's a really nice size area and can accommodate a lot of people!
12745,Love the food here Pizza is amazing salmon pate is awesome along with the Diablo breadsticks does take a bit to get in because it's so popular you can bypass an order takeout which if you're not there for the atmosphere or their craft brew beers it's a nice option parking lot also can be a bit of a challenge as the popularity of this place exceeds itself highly recommend the Call of the Wild also the Santa's Little Helper all of which were cooked to perfection
12746,Good service
12747,OUT OF BUSINESS
12748,"Thomas the asst.mgr of the furniture Department just came up to me while I was sitting on the sofa  and asked me if I was going to buy it, I  said no. I was thinking of buying one because I need one for my living room but I just watched him kick everybody else that was sitting on a sofa off of them. I been coming  into the store since I was a snot nose and I've never once been told I couldn't sit there so apparently we got a police of the furniture Department.   Lyles has has better customer service and you're allowed to sit there and try out what you may buy. I work in retail and I know you don't start off the conversation with ""are going to buy something"",  you would probably start with a smile which he did not or ask you how you doing which he did not. JUNEAU ALASKA FRED MEYER SUCKS"
12749,Always clean nice good movie choices. Chairs are comfortable recliners. Ok prices.
12750,"Great local sporting goods store.

12758,Less known national park and a must visit for great views and total wilderness!
12759,Everybody loves Big Daddy's BBQ.
12760,The battered cod was outstanding. Come with an empty stomach.
12761,Fun atmosphere and interesting food and items to buy.  Really enjoyed it.
12762,Sales person was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Great selection of sxs but not many 4 wheelers.
12763,Beautiful lakes and family friendly camping ! There every weekend when the sun is out.
12764,"Another wolf in sheep's clothing-they only want your money, don't care about service let alone ""alaskans"""
12765,it's well maintained next people it's a good place to go camp
12766,Only two lanes open that were not express at 8 pm. Very frustrating.  They also run out of a lot of things.
12767,"Consistently Unimpressed. Poor service, worse seating, and the food has been uninspired all three times we visited. ""No, no, you keep."""
12768,The staff is so nice and i always have an easy time getting help if i need it.
12769,"(Translated by Google) Where you can experience dog sledding

12771,"Someone in my family has an alarming Miller's addiction, so I try something different every time.
It's just ice cream"
12772,"The best fresh fish and chips Ive had in ages. Come early, they do run out."
12773,Wow this is a really cool store. Can always find something to take home.The prices are great the owner is super nice and the other staff also
12774,Nice park. Lots of trails. Well maintained. Sprawling.
12775,First time in for lunch and I had the mushroom bacon burger with salmon chowder. Loved the food so much that I went back for dinner and had the chicken manicotti.
12776,Fast easy and convenient..  helps business
12777,Beautiful
12778,"Scam! Scam! Scam! Spent $800+ in fan belt, brake light and oil change. At the end of the end of the week, brake light and fan belt was the same. Took it back and had it checked again for more money and still no solution. Not going here again."
12779,"They know their coffee and the food is excellent, the deserts especially."
12780,Always love swinging by. Awesome selectionary. Plus the owners are friendly and willing to help. Never a dull day when picking up a record.
12781,"Love this place! Beautifully designed, and excellent service! Great designs and work as well. Only place I loved getting my nails done at in Anchorage."
12782,Room was normal. 24 hour shuttle to the airport only runs on the hour in the morning.
12783,"Friendly and flexible, am leaving on a trip tomorrow and they slipped me in same day. Pleased with the service otherwise as well."
12784,Its a friendy store
12785,Awesome job
12786,Best Ribeyes s
12787,I love subway
12788,"Thank goodness, we still have this store in Alaska."
12789,Undeniably the most luxurious accommodations in Anchorage.
12790,"Dive bar, very chill casual atmosphere."
12791,Coffee is great and the donut I had was so soft. Pretty good place.
12792,"Windy as sh#@ with a storm comming in and snow blowing hard enough to sting and require protective eyewear. This place is wonderful, above treeline and exposed."
12793,The food was really good here it was what we ordered and it was hot. We were able to drive right in without any wait on a Friday night. I've ate sonic in other states but I thought this was better than most.
12794,"Dated rooms, there was hair in the shower. A family with children was placed above us. Past midnight kids were running back and forth staff was notified with no resolution.  Tv and phones didn't work,  staff notified,  no resolution,  didnt even send anyone to come fix it. Pool, hot tub and breakfast were good. In room whirlpool had cracks in the plastic that were uncomfortable.  Not woth the price, should be even cheaper. If quality is important to you, skip this one."
12795,Love the coffee and the atmosphere! The girls are amazing and remember me and my order everytime I stop by. The rewards program is one of the best I have seen. I just redeemed my points for an awesome hydroflask!
12796,"The food here is amazing. Top-notch. And the staff is very friendly. However, I really wish they would do a better job of packaging their to go orders as they don’t have bags or boxes or containers that handle the trip home without spilling."
12797,Good portion
12798,"Very, nice experience."
12799,Nice atmosphere and tasty breakfast.

12803,It's fast food...
12804,Poor service at breakfast buffet but fine location
12805,"There is eating for food and then there is eating to be nourished.  There are many Thai food places here in Fairbanks, yet today I found my favorite place.  I got the House Noodle at the hot spice level.  I was excited to try their home made noodles and I love the large noodles that come with three of their dishes.   The woman who took my to go order made me feel welcomed and respected.  The experience felt like being an honored guest in her home, yet it is a  restaurant.  I almost cried as she has a radiating spirit that reminds me of my own favorite Aunties.  I was so humbled by her hospitality and grace.  Fast forward to actually trying the famous noodles and I had a feeling it would be good but was unprepared for it to be life changingly good.  Yummy to the power of yummy.  Awesome spice level.  Huge portion. The Noodles!  A revolution in texture and flavor.  I seriously don’t want to go to any other Thai restaurant in Fairbanks until I have tried everything on the menu at The Noodle House.  Awesome fresh rolls and iced coffee.  This place is extraordinary and the food is extra special.   Looking forward to returning to dine in.   This place is a place to nourish your body, mind and spirit."
12806,Always has what I'm looking for. Great customer service.
12807,"This is the most professional, organized and friendly medical office I have ever been to. They have so many services in one place, imaging, medical, dental, pharmacy and more."
12808,Love the place.
12809,"Service was great, food decent, I'd go twice"
12810,"I enjoy Taco King, but won't order the Menudo again.  Not much flavor, not much hominy.  I much prefer the pozole.  The flan was WAY set, but I really liked it.  The staff is always so friendly and I love chatting with them in Spanish."
12811,Over priced for lunch. Paid 16$ for dried salty food.
12812,"Nice items, but very expensive. I only go here when I cant find what I need else where."
12813,Good food gteat place to eat and chill while you wair for your clothes to wash
12814,I had so much fun here. The food is cooked right in front of you and with a show. It tastes great and the staff is right the to get u another drink should u want 1
12815,"Second to none is an awesome company overall very nice and great customer service, one of my windows was broken into and shattered and they replaced it in a timely matter and for a great price. They even offer warranty on their services! Would recommend this company to anyone looking for a window tint, they do also offer a no credit check leasing program on items they provide at their shop they have LED lights and Wraps for your car as well as speakers hit them up and they’ll get it done thanks for the awesome customer service!"
12816,This is a great place.  Full inventory of RV parts.
12817,They sent me the wrong rice and the food is very bland. Will not be ordering again.
12818,Hard to get the attention of employees of you have questions.
12819,"Good service, great beer. Nice chill spot on the way north."
12820,Upgrade and location is awesome. Clean. Better screens.  Set up is acceptable.

12822,One of favorite places to stay. Close to Alaska railroad depot. Great place to stay.
12823,"Good food, good service, clean place."
12824,Clean and wide trail..Dog friendly and offered great views and some benches for sitting and enjoying the views.
12825,Salmon overcooked
12826,It's better than most.
12827,"Not all lift operators are created equal; and, if only going round-trip, once, it's an expensive ride! Those two things being said, as a local, I love the tram. The views are stellar and it's a wonderful experience to see Juneau from new heights without hiking up a mountain on one's own to do so.

Most of the tramway 🚡 operators are knowledgeable, out-going, and enjoy what they do. I have yet to meet an employee working the tram that I didn't like! Be aware that the tram, as it's being docked at the top, does slow down and rock gently back and forth prior to it lodging firmly into place for your safe exit on the top of Mount Roberts. If you have a fear of heights, the rocking motion may make you uneasy; and, it's important to note, the tram does have you riding above treetops. If afraid of heights, look out and not down! The lift takes about 5 minutes to go up and 5 minutes to go back down and is made available for either direction within reasonably spaced, short intervals. Once off-loaded, at the top of Mount Roberts, take your time to enjoy the Nature Center, the Gift Shop, Grab a Bite to Eat, and find your way to Father Brown's Cross for Amazing, Awe-inspiring Views that seem like movie back-drops but are perfectly real; a place where time stands still.

What goes up, must come down; thankfully, a tram like the one in Juneau is safe, secure, and smooth. It seems to glide as it brings you back down to earth. It's a brilliant contraption that's well maintained and kept clean. If a tourist, the expensive, round-trip ticket is worth the cost for a once in a lifetime experience like none other. If a local, the season pass would be a good thing to nab as it'll save you money and allow you to travel, by tram, as often as you'd like. 😊"
12828,Not cooked there but employees were nice hadn't ate all day I'm diabetic  sugar dropped to low didnt want to drive home that way and a candy bar makes me sleepy
12829,Gluten and Dairy Free Options! Unfortunately the staff was less then welcoming and none of them knew the WiFi password. Normally this wouldn't be an issue but it was advertised all over the store and we recently moved so I was in need of a place for kids to  talk to their deployed Dad.
12830,Great martinis!
12831,"It took them 3 times to get the order right. And they all looked lost. My friend said ""what is it clown hour at wendys"" I'm sure not all the workers are like this."
12832,"Quick, good price, food is good-not fancy"
12833,Don't come here expecting regular steakhouse ambience. This is more like an 80s dive bar. The staff are dressed in tshirts and aren't very courteous. The lack of service nearly ruined my birthday dinner. Won't be back.
12834,Wonderful place. We had a lovely vibrant Athabascan lady guide. She made it tops
12835,No complaints
12836,"It's convenient and consistent. The staff is very friendly. I mean, it's Denny's, so don't expect high end! Sometimes it's just nice to know that you are going to get exactly what you expect every time you walk in."
12837,"Good place to get groceries, clothing, and other things you'll need. Could use a little remodeling."
12838,Comfy.
12839,FRIENDLY CHECKERS AND NO SHORTAGE OF THEM AS WELL.  PLUS THEY HAD THE GIRL SCOUTS THERE AND I WAS ABLE TO SCORE MY FAVORITE COOKIES :)
12840,"First experience was great. Second was really bad. Food wasn't that good. Waiter was horrible,  badgered me twice about ordering for my wife (she makes me), made me get her ID out of the car for an o'douls but then didn't check it, spent most of the time laughing at the bar with regulars while we sat with empty waters, no napkins, and needing ketchup. Even though we liked it so much the first time we went back two days later, the second experience ruined it forever."
12841,Friendly staff well stocked
12842,"Great hotel in downtown within walking distance.
Nice comfortable room and bed.
Highly recommended!!"
12843,"I just had my teeth cleaned and had a wonderful experience. The office is beautiful. All of the staff are warm, professional, super informative. Dr. Bowman explained everything, walked me through my x-rays and provided next steps to preventative tooth care. I've never had a dentist do such a thorough, comprehensive review and explanation of what's going on with my teeth with me before. This is an exceptional practice! And I wish I recalled the name of the Dental Hygienist but kudos to her, she did a wonderful job!"
12844,So nice to get away
12845,No complaint. A little expensive but what do you expect for an island?
12846,The workers don't bother you therr. You have your own bay to clean and detail your car on your time with nobody disturbing or rushing you.
12847,Scenery
12848,They don't know what they're doing
12849,This is a awesome storage place.
12850,I called in an order and was told 10-15 min. 35 min later I am still waiting.
12851,"Mmmhmmmm some good dang eats here. I took the choice of burrito over 3 tacos. The tacos are same size as $1 tacos on the side of the Nashville street but this ain't Nashville! Anyways, she says temp of queso could be higher but whatever. They're also military friendly with discounts which means we were soooooold!"
12852,"Excellent halibut burger. The pecan pie was good, but heated up a bit too long. My crust melted. It was still tasty."
12853,Gr8 customer service
12854,Good food and great service
12855,This place helped us with all that we needed for our car
12856,It's a Duluth store ! Nice to see stuff in person vs the catalog.
12857,"Well the meal was good. I always love to change it up every once and a while with a whopper. I dont eat fast food often and kind of noticed that the few times I've stopped at Burger King, almost every item is luke warm."
12858,Trisha was wonderful!! She was very helpful and walked us through the cash checking process and Brittany was busting her butt making the store a comfortable place to wait for my check to be processed!!
12859,"Whoever is at the health wellness fair (br booth)at my place of employment ,
You might get sales/memberships If you engage with us.  I was interested, but a quiet representative doesn't help me much."
12860,My server Jennifer was amazing.
12861,Best meat ever !
12862,Awesome
12863,Full service  good people good service
12864,"Wonderful assortment of trails to hike/bike for all skill levels. Trails are also very breath taking and peaceful. Some are more popular than others, but I don't believe any of them would be a mistake to try out. If you don't believe just go for yourself."
12865,"The Red Fox is the best bar in Fairbanks. Full stop. It's also got some of the best food in town, and absolutely the best burgers. Great place for lunch or dinner.

The staff are always super friendly and fun, the drinks are reasonably priced and reasonably boozy, and the food is absolutely stellar. Like...I cannot stress enough how yummy their food is. Best fries anywhere in Alaska - try the sidewinders. I've never once ordered food from here and been disappointed. For example...the veggies that come out with a burger or in a salad are always fresh and crisp - you never get gross, yellow-brown lettuce here.

There are also a bunch of nice pool tables and dart boards."
12866,"The cashier named Brittany didn't smile once,  a lil girl came up to ask for her shake and was told I need to help this guy first,  ur gonna have to wait... I would have told her wait on her first if I hadn't already ordered. Poor lil girl was so 😞"
12867,Very tasty pizza. Cheapest place to get lunch. Staff if amazeballs.
12868,If you like Pho which I do this is the place!
12869,Best phone service in Alaska
12870,Great pies so yummy
12871,Very good. I'll be back.
12872,"Fantastic, simple fajitas and good service. Pleasant size and nice touches in the interior make for a tasty, low-key option later in the evening."
12873,Clean
12874,"Great coffee,  awesome service!"
12875,"The food is probably the best in Alaska, the restaurant has some style. The restaurant is noisy, though. I've lived in Paris and Lyon, France, for quite a while so it's hard to get 5 stars from me."
12876,They've got you because you at the end of the road but springs and restaurant are very nice
12877,Where Anchorage’s diverse people come to shop. Wonderful selection of harder to find foods.
12878,Love this park
12879,"Service was great, Jerry had the paperwork done in just over a half hour and had me ready to go with a new trailer. Price was fair and I felt like I had been treated right. Great place to do business....."
12880,Good place to shop
12881,Good shopping experience.
12882,Always great selection!
12883,Lands end resort is freaking awesome
12884,Busy little swimming hole... perfect bike ride down to from neighboring area.
12885,I love good food
12886,Front office staff is always very friendly and professional. Greets patients by names not numbers. The doctors are amazing and I cannot say enough great things about the massage therapy staff.
12887,"Best ""on-the go"" food. Theres always something here for everyone."
12888,Really liked the Main Lodge! Great breakfast and dinner! Liked that we could walk around. Sorry that Denali was in the clouds though.
12889,Very good.  Recommended.  Just be prepared for the fees and charges.  About $20 per.
12890,"Long azz line at drive thru. Not there fault, I guess."
12891,Great location. Memorial Day’s Brew fest is epic
12892,Always nice
12893,Hard to get right parts first time.
12894,Just a great place.  The Zoo Lights are worth going for alone.
12895,"If I could give less than one star I would. I ordered the Filet Mignon because I usually don't make steaks myself. I ordered it well done because the last thing I want to see is my meat bleeding.
My filet came and it was more than raw. The outside was seared but the middle was absolutely not cooked at all. They took it back, redid it, and it came out almost the same. I had to go home and put it in the oven to be able to eat it.
The price is far too expensive for what you get and service was very inattentive as well.
I will definitely not return and would never recommend this place."
12896,So delicious! People complained they were out of some food. I think It’s amazing to think they can get food to a restaurant in such a remote location. We’re so lucky! The meals were delicious and it’s a fun environment.
12897,Tasty sushi
12898,Great Italian Food
12899,Fantastic steak.

12903,"Hands down one of the best kept secrets in Anchorage! If you want a well made breakfast, that also breaks the mold and shakes things up. This is the place for you!"
12904,It's all about the bacon...
12905,Lots of walls and very friendly and fun! The walls change daily with routes to climb from beginner to expert well marked. They also offer classes for those new to climbing.
12906,"I grew up down the street from this park. I went there at least once, sometimes twice a day. It was my cool off spot when I needed some alone time to think or listen to music. It's very quiet and not very highly trafficked, but it's very nice."
12907,Very good late lunch.
12908,About as close as your going to get to the teriyaki chicken rice bowls you get in Washington State.
12909,"Very nice. Comfortable rooms, quiet halls, great restaurants."

12919,"This is one of the best dispensaries in the state. Always a great selection, great growers, friendly and knowledgeable budtenders, and the best loyalty program, with veterans and medical discounts."
12920,its a nice place to go and take a hike in the woods
12921,Not bad at all
12922,This is BY FAR MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE!!!

12929,"The only campground we stay at when in Delta. Not large, not fancy but has a comfortable feel to it.  It's in town and an IGA grocery store that is amazing. We have a 31 foot motorhome and can park in any of the campsites. There is designated tent sites as well. A clean and maintained camp that is $15 a night,  which is average for a dry camp here in Alaska. Stop by if you can.
Enjoy"
12930,The karate is amazing and they cut hair to... One stop shop
12931,Over priced service. Ripping off people. Better to switch to ACS unlimited internet and use streaming instead of getting bundled in bills.
12932,Great for breakfast
12933,Good service

12946,Amazing views
12947,Idk
12948,"Good place to have a beer and chill. Good live music and dancing. Food is typical bar food nothing to write home about but it hits the spot when you have a few drinks in you. They have cheeseburgers, Philly's, fries, jalapeño poppers, etc."
12949,Customer service is pretty poor. “Only girl at the dance” mentality. Probably the best selection of tools in town though.
12950,Superb production of Devilfish tonight.
12951,"It's a decent theater, but the IMax experience is not what I expected. It's needs to be upgraded with newer speakers and a new screen. I know this is the only theater in town but some up grades are due. It gets 4 stars by default."
12952,"Friendly,"
12953,This was the best market we visited while in town for 2+ weeks. Wide selection and friendly staff. Highly recommended!
12954,"The owner is very understanding, running a business not a boarding house. I liked his easy going manner. Family oriented. Just trying to help the ones who are trying to help themselves. Keep ur level of company to a minimal though."
12955,Plenty of moose poop but no moose.  Did see a bunch of ducks though.
12956,"DEFINITELY not the highest quality food, but put together right and the prices are really good."
12957,Fantastic!
12958,"A big choice of really craftfully prepared meals, plus so much more! Healthy and vegetarian options ^_^"
12959,Wood Center is great as far as College Facilities go. However the food is more often than not awful. The frequent breakfast chef consistently overcooks orders.
12960,Great family trip.

12973,"Took great care of us and our Chevy Equinox.
Had it shipped from Alaska to Seattle.
The cab driver dropped me off at the wrong yard and one of the employees used her personal car to drive me to the correct one which was not walking distance.
They placed paper mats on the floorboard and plastic on the driver's seat to keep it clean.
Great company and great experience 👍
Thank you!"
12974,Freddy's is my favorite everything you need
12975,They did a good check out of my heating system and a pre sell inspection. Reasonable price and in time.

12996,Great service and delicious burgers. This was my first time here. I was greeted at the door like I was regular and seated immediately. I’ll definitely be back here.
12997,"I have lived in North Pole for roughly 4 years now and eaten Pagoda at least once a month since then. First couple of time I ate here, both dine in and to-go, it was great! Prices were reasonable for the food, wait time was never terrible, and the staff was kind and attentive. But, recently(as in the last 4-5 months) the food has been subpar, the portion sizes have gotten smaller, and the prices have increased 3-5$ per meal. Now instead of having a tremendous Chinese restaurant right down the road I choose to drive into Fairbanks and order elsewhere."
12998,To go sandwiches
12999,Absolutely a one of a kind gem. Magical!!

Worship music is good.
People are nice."
13004,"I hadn't been to Olive Garden in a long time. We went on Christmas Eve for lunch and were seated right away.
Service was excellent. It was refreshing to have a waiter that knew wine.
I enjoyed my steak as it was perfectly cooked. My daughter enjoyed her fettuccine dish as well.
The portions were appropriate & we, overall had a great time. We decided this will be an annual outing for us.
The desserts were delicious as well."
13005,"Great thai wings. Great beer selection. Have had friends say that the service can be bad sometimes, but I've personally never experienced it."
13006,Very good.  Will be going back.

13033,Great outdoors store
13034,"This restaurant can be good depending on when you visit it. They have seasonal menus and the last time I visited, they were under renovation and had a greatly reduced menu. It is very convenient if you're already staying at the hotel though."
13035,"Quality of food was amazing, sooo Tasty."
13036,The cookies are amazing
13037,Best burgers in town!
13038,Under construction for Dave and Busters but it still has good shopping
13039,Almost Everytime our order gets messed up.
13040,"So, I have been to D&Bs in the lower 48 and this is close. Their prices are comparable to what I have seen in the past. Games are expensive as expected. The biggest downfall, it is really really loud in there. I felt like the waitress and our table had to yell at each other to even order. They were out of some things and we didn't know until they brought our food out. My food was brought out last and then it was wrong - so everyone was done eating by the time my food was corrected and brought out. Shouldn't expect much with what I have experienced since moving to Alaska. I may go back again just to see if anything has changed."
13041,Good car and pet wash.
13042,"Southside Grill offers affordable, american classics with a strong breakfast menu (as seen by their busy weekend mornings), along with a solid lunch lineup. I often order to pickup from there, as they are one of the only places on this far south in town to get a good philly or burger.

The dining in experience can be mixed , depending on how busy they are, but food is always great and the family-run atmosphere is warm. In my most recent dining experience, my wife and I ordered skillets, which both came out quickly, were well portioned and delicious.

If you are looking for breakfast or lunch in Southside and want to eat local while not breaking the bank, this is a great place to check out!"
13043,At least one step up from McDonald's or Burger King probably more
13044,I would give them a 5 but there is not a mask requirement
13045,"This is more if an adult spot
I enjoyed it
Plus there is a secret room hidden within"
13046,"It was really cool and had tons of stuff to see, do, and purchase but super expensive to do any of it. Also was very poorly mapped out."

13048,This was a lovely meal
13049,Lots of vendors selling all kinds of products and food. Try to visit during special events to the get most out of your trip. Some days there are less vendors than others though so it can be hit or miss.
13050,The food was so delicious. This was first time I had it.
13051,A great place to attend events whether a hockey game or a Chamber of Commerce luncheon.
13052,Improvement made over the past year have been worth every penny!   It's a nice place to shop.  Excited about DAVE & Busters opening!
13053,Very nice

13059,Winter hiking the falls is a completely different experience versus the summer
13060,"They frequently get orders wrong, and my ""steak"" was practically ground beef, I made the mistake of eating the brown sludge. Exploded the toilet after 15 minutes, gave me stomache cramps...etc...."
13061,My daughter and I love the seafood pho and fresh rolls!
13062,"Perkup is my favorite coffee shack. It doesn't matter which one you stop at, the coffee and service is always good."

13064,Pricey
13065,"I Order for take out, the staff was nice from what I saw and the food was good. the prices were really high compared to all sushi restaurants I've been to, even haru before it burnt down which was my favorite sushi place"
13066,"Pizza and drinks, this place cannot be beat. Highly recommend for out of town, but be warn, always packed, so may have to wait, but worth the wait."
13067,Great stuff
13068,This place is the best in Àlaska
13069,Good bargain wash.
13070,Only go for their ice-cream but it's always delicious! Favorites are the hot fudge sundae and reeses blizzard.
13071,"I was incredibly impressed when I got my haircut by Shelby today! She did exactly what I wanted and even guided me to a better cut for my hair texture. The price is awesome too. The shop is cute, clean and comfortable! What else could you ask for!?"

13073,"Wow!! Delicious crepe bombs! They take a heaping scoop of your choice ice cream, wrap it in a crepe, then cover it in a special sauce of your choice. Amazing!!"

If I’m fancy dining I always get halibut cheeks if they’re available. So good. This place never disappoints."
13082,Decent selection.
13083,Always  a wonderful  place to  visit  and very enjoyable
13084,Great food.  Great view.  Great Staff.  A bit pricey.
13085,Excellent! I order the Reuben Eggrolls everytime I go. Josh's cheesecake is a family recipe that was delicious. They make espresso now too! I love this place. Highly recommend :)
13086,Staff has gone out of their way multiple times to help.
13087,"It is kind of like a food truck inside of a decent bar.  I'd give it a higher rating for the food, but the setup and prices drive my rating down.  The food is pretty solid. . .but you pay for it.  Of course, everything in Juneau is expensive."
13088,"Helpful staff, decent stuff at a decent price, lines are fairly short."
13089,Good place
13090,Good place

13093,"Great selection, prices are o.k."
13094,"Even though they couldn't help me immediately, there are very helpful in telling me what I needed to know so that I could get what I needed done done."
13095,Nice compact groceries in town with a surprising number of fresh vegetables.
13096,Paul was very professional and thorough!! Fixed the problem in a half an hour. 5 stars for sure!!!
13097,Good place to eat
13098,"A great dining experience, Senor Panchos is a wonderful family option. My young kids call it Seymore Punchos which adds to the fun of this Authentic Mexican restaurant. Their menu is ever changing with new additions but has long standing favorites as well (try sharing the fajitas meal with extra shells with a friend). There is an increasing number of locals who eat here simply to get a great tasting burger at a decent price comparitively with other local establishments. Say hello to the cook and you might even be talking with the owner, an friendly guy!"
13099,It's cold in there!!!
13100,Beautiful.
13101,"Took the Arctic Circle tour. Saw Alaska, the Yukon river, the pipeline, tundra,th3 Dalton highway from Ice Road Truckers. The driver /guide was very knowledgeable with interesting stories and local details. It's a long ride so be prepared. You do have stops for food and snacks."
13102,They are very friendly and professional. Their building is new and updated. So I felt as if my dog was getting the best treatment possible the entire time I was there.
13103,Ok food we need more choices in Wasilla!
13104,"Good whole food, old style restaurant."
13105,The best customer service from any restaurant in Alaska. These employees are always in an outstanding mood and incredibly cheerful!!!!! Plus the food is always banging as well!
13106,Beautiful national Forest with great sites.  It was my first time seeing glaciers and I recommend it to everyone who hasn't been!
13107,Some of the best flower in town
13108,Always good!!
13109,Hit or miss with food quality... nice staff though (staff earns the 3rd star)
13110,For all your general needs it's the place with the most.
13111,Delicious pizzas!
13112,Good fast food
13113,"This place is so big and has all the rocks you could dream of! They've got geodes (big and small), sages and smudge kits, statues of greek/romen/nordic gods & goddesses and fairey's, fossils, books, and so many other trinkets and tokens. Everything is reasonably priced or much cheaper than most crystal shops I've been to. They'll even hold your rocks at the front counter if you find you've fallen in love with too many crystals to carry.
They are more than happy to help and guide you to what it is you're looking for. If you need a glass case opened you simply have to make eye contact with an employee and they're on their way! They also gifted me a small quarts with my purchase - one that I love and am so thankful for. I have fallen in love with this shop and will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Anchorage. Thank you guys!"
13114,"Came here for a new key fob for my car. Pricing was fair and staff was friendly. However, the install took a very long time, over 40 minutes. Eventually a manager had to step in. He discovered that my car had a dead battery, and that's why the key wouldn't work. He hooked me up with a new battery and did a very good job installing it. I've installed a few car batteries myself, but I could not have done a better job. I'd come here again for a new car battery. They gave me some discounts/coupons for the trouble. In short, the store manager was great, but the staff could use more training."
13115,Great staff and great historic feel. Very clean.
13116,So happy to have Costco. Clean and organized store. Lots of organic options. Good prices. No discount for expiring meat. Only real gripe is the paper straws...they instantly break after one sip. Staff are great and SO polite compared to Walmart. 1/2 of store is home goods and 1/2 is grocery so you may have 2 brand options for each item. And unlike Sam's there have never been long lines. They are doing it right.
13117,Clean restaurant. Good eggs benedict!
13118,"Service was just ok, but they were busy. Seems prices have crept up, too."
13119,This is my favorite location. Great staff and always have everything on the menu.
13120,"Rude customer service, every time I make a choice to come here there ALWAYS out of items or utensils. They were out of straws, lids, butter, honey, or out of chicken. They take forever to cook items. Instead of having more chicken up when the old batch is done I waited 20 mins for NEW chicken which wasn’t a problem, but they made a big deal about my special request.
They also charge for dippin sauces , out of state I never have to PAY for those."
13121,"Excellent service, thank you Daniel! I'll be back."
13122,Very nice organized shop.  I was just looking and the staff let me.  Would have like to see more prices in some of the merchandise but I am sure if I had asked they would got for me.
13123,Burrito bowls!!!!!!!!!
13124,Cheap gas
13125,Great service good food
13126,They give quotes and then they want you to make an appointment and then raise the price almost twice as much 🤑👎absolutely just criminals
13127,It's dead Jim.
13128,We stopped in on a Monday during the offseason. It was understandably quiet and the kind man running the place made us feel right at home. He was kind and patient as our toddler ran around the place exploring. The food was just what we needed to fuel up for our drive back to Fairbanks. Thanks for hospitality!
13129,"With beautiful, untouched, vista views how could Eagle Beach not receive a 5 star rating? Picnic Areas, Trails, Beach-Front with  Sand and typically not crowded with traffic (people, vehicle, or otherwise). Great place to bird watch, look for animal tracks, simply sit and enjoy nature, or watch your kids play with sand/beach toys. Photo opportunities abound!"
13130,It's a great store. The prices  good. They have a something for everyone. The service is awesome.
13131,Great fuel oil prices
13132,Nice

13135,Ass
13136,Try curbside pickup it is great
13137,"The Jewel Lake KBC is yet another reliable location of Alaska's venerable and beloved Kaladi Brothers group. I don't hit the Jewel Lake store as frequently as some of the others, but was near Kincaid Park when the caffeine demon called my name. My latte was delicious and came with a lovely rosette, a much-appreciated touch. Kaladi Brothers never disappoints. ☕"
13138,"Good food, friendly staff."
13139,"Just ok,, interesting shops"
13140,"Service was nonexistant except at check out, selection was okay, prices are high"

13151,Northern-most Denny's in the world. Great family-style dining. Breakfast all day. Superb service.
13152,The hotel has come a long way. I felt safe and it was clean. Not to many extras lingering outside. The checkd IDs to make sure you were supposed to be there. Extra pillows from the front. And front desk lady was nice. They even have jacuzzi rooms!
13153,Always find what I need
13154,Great food! Great Service!
13155,Overpriced
13156,"Plenty of variety for everyone, and good decoration."
13157,The food and service is downright mediocre.
13158,"Old-school Anchorage style Chinese and Korean. Always freshly prepared, fast, efficient service. Huge selection of great cheap M-F lunch specials (sweet and sour pork and spicy garlic chicken with fried or steamed rice and egg roll, hot tea - $8.95!) Ignore the neighborhood. Don't ask for subs, it upsets the rhythm (and you won't get it  anyway.) Cozy old-school atmosphere. Takeout available."
13159,Awesome food!
13160,Tasty!  Great service and nice atmosphere!
13161,Great food and customer service
13162,The line is always 15 cars long but moves pretty quick.
13163,"There’s a good variety of stuff here however almost everything we picked up was expired or about to be. Also, the prices are a lot higher than other Asian markets nearby."
13164,"Exhorbant cost
Save your money...want to say to all people coming to Ak. that get drawn here to this place....

Hidden cost, contracts are changed ,information untrue. This place was an inheritance  and now in hands of grandchildren they did what grandparents did not want...make money off people .   I knew the original owners. Too bad.

Diamond M= be fair. It cost a lot to come to Ak.   to see our state. You do not need to charge so much. Start a new reputation as a gift.

Thankyou for sharing. That is what is lacking. Be a part of a better world. Help the poor. They are thrown around. Help the wealthy. They are used. Change , help share Ak. You charge to much. By your actions you can help the children. Free. You were given, now give more freely.

Why havent you ,btw,open up something, somewhere  for the underprivileged singled ,disabled Alaskans that are homeless?   Tiny homes. Help the year around senior disabled citizens that built Alaska before you were even here. Theres a reputation to be proud of."
13165,The have good clothes for affordable prices
13166,"Not terrible, classic BWW experience. Slow waiters, slow cooks, and entrees coming out with the actual food."
13167,Very nice
13168,The food is always so good and fresh.  They give you so much meat it's like you ask for double. I got an Italian toasted to go. It was still hot when I got home. Family owned small business.
13169,Great rooms and views. WiFi only at main Lodge
13170,Beautiful
13171,A decent IPA and super friendly people.
13172,Great coffee
13173,True steak house. Great Food. Good lunch prices
13174,Delicious food and fun atmosphere!
13175,Eggs were burnt.....omelette was a slab of eggs laying on cubed ham and cheese.....not an omelette......Coffee is good
13176,Very disappointed with the deli (hot food) no menus too look at no posting of any lunch deals. Ended up going to Safeway.
13177,Very busy place. We got someone else's order but didn't know until after we left. Descent burger.
13178,Beware! It's true what people are saying in these reviews. I filled out the online form to receive a quote from these guys and received a call from Eric. As soon as I mentioned I was not ready to purchase their service at this time he promptly hung up. What's the deal Alaska Car Transport? Are you intentionally trying to drive people to your competition? Completely unprofessional and downright rude.
13179,Quaint
13180,Other than the super ex expensive drone we bought not working & an extreme shortage of things all was good
13181,"Fair prices, fast service, not much more you can ask for."
13182,Just like Korea! Great food. Great service. Huge portions. Wonderful homemade kimchi!
13183,Good drinks and food and people
13184,"Has some good cafés in it like Java haus, and a small gear shop. Prices are expensive but that's to be expected at any resort"
13185,The brisket and ribs here are to die for. One of the only places to get decent BBQ.
13186,"The ethiopian hot tea (shahee) is incredible! The food is good too, and as authentic as they can get with what ingredients they can find in Anchorage.

Heads up: they don't take cards, so bring cash!"
13187,"Great service, good was excellent as always!"
13188,"The people are always very nice, and the drinks are great!"
13189,Caught a late night flick before heading to the airport
13190,"My go to shop, entire staff is friendly, and even when you can tell theyre drained, they still smile and assist you just like anyone else. They have high quality bud as well as the most affordable shake pre-roll in town. 5/5 after coming here for 9 months, weekly."
13191,"A most attentive staff who pay attention to detail.  I was apprehensive about back surgery, but their thoroughness and patience answering all my questions allayed those fears.  Post operative care was just as responsive."
13192,Booooo overpriced
13193,"Cheap, delicious food available 24 hours a day. They even have Happier Hour from 2-5 pm for their drinks."
13194,This place in wasilla to get ice cream
13195,Expensive
13196,"I had Moyashi Nira Ramen, and it was amazing!!!"
13197,"Nice inventory of fabrics, crafts etc. But they snarl when you try to use coupons at the checkout so that didn't make my experience fun (sigh and roll eyes). We went there because we had the coupons."
13198,"The place is a small, but quite excellently packed store with high quality clothing. Not so much gear, but if you want to be warm with either personal or work gear? Great prices.
Almost immediately the staff offered help and were attentive to the customers.
I picked up a good winter jacket and some wool socks without breaking the bank. Parking space is a little tight, so plan ahead and be careful."
13199,Can get everything I need in 1 store
13200,"Great selection, awesome prices and great people as well ! I took guitar lessons from Scott and the lessons leveled me up 3X! Thank you!"
13201,Good time
13202,Friendly staff and amazing food😊
13203,They have amazing food! The only thing better is the service!
13204,"Been going here for years, since the year this location opened. Sometimes the selection isn't the best for apparel, but the service and parts and new bike selection is fantastic! The same mechanic has been working on my bikes the whole time."
13205,Over priced for your acreage consumer but still a nice place with lots to admire and wish you cooed afford.
13206,Love it
13207,This mexican restaurant for Alaska is good.  Compared to our favorite cantina in spring branch texas it doesnt quite meet that standard
13208,Good food
13209,Best ice-cream in Alaska!!
13210,"Do any Americans work here.
Severe language barrier."
13211,"Nice, knowledgeable staff. Only complaint is that I wished I would have been I formed that the ""suggestions"" (ear swab and wound take swap) would be $40+ each! I would have passed."
13212,"Usually overcrowded with pieces on the showroom floor, though that's most any Pier 1. Overpriced, which is also any Pier 1."
13213,Great place to take the dogs in the summer and has unlimited mountain biking trails. Beautiful views!
13214,"Buffet not bad, but not the greatest"
13215,They exceeded my expectations.   Would bring my cars to them again.
13216,"Awesome place for music, events and fun!  They have a great menu too!"
13217,Great customer service.   Offered great alternative when out of item I was looking for.
13218,Standard Walmart.  4 stars because they had Coleman GoKarts for $800
13219,"Foods cheap and always amazing, ambience is usually pleasant, their bagels and their cakes are my favorite, and so far have never gotten anything I didn't enjoy"
13220,"Prices are okay, staff was helpful and store was clean."
13221,Good coffee
13222,Tried it a few times never impressed
13223,"Just their.  Had the Halibut which was in the frier too long and burnt. The cole slaw was the worst I have ever experienced. Had the onion soup as well, that was good now. Slow service. Overall, your lucky U got 2 Stars !"
13224,This location usually has what I need and provides good customer service
13225,A little slow.
13226,Excellent shop with excellent staff! Great ammo prices for AK...
13227,Known Dr. Kendall for a while now and he has always done good work.  The staff are polite and respectful.
13228,Cooking steaks in the brick oven does something to them that makes them melt in your mouth and tender enough you barely need a knife .   We also tried the Halibut morsels & Calimari .   They serve a Strawberry - Rhubarb wine from a local winery that is amazing.
13229,Good food and atmosphere
13230,Everyone
13231,Slow
13232,"Tortillas were not of good quality, and the tacos fell apart within 5 seconds of picking them up. Since this is their main staple on the menu, one would think they would be great.  Flavoring for three types of meat all tasted the same, and the portions were incredibly small for the price.  Choose your local cart over this."
13233,"Always forgets stuff. Doesn't make sure to ask questions about the meal like, what kind of sauce or pieces of meat.
Coleslaw was expired and warm..
Biscuits sat in heat way to long and were very dry. The soad machine must have been out of co2..
Much needed work done to this place."
13234,Nice selection and sweet people.
13235,"The girl that took her ordercouldn't get the order right so it had to be repeated several times, then it turned out that they were out of thingsthat we had ordered but we didn't find that out until we've gotten all the way up to the second window which took about 10 minutes but we did get most of what we ordered and it was lukewarm so yay"
13236,As always great service great food
13237,Great place
13238,Always great to visit this park and we saw Denali this time
13239,Small not much inventory but great customer service
13240,"Was recommended by a friend of my girlfriends that said it was pretty good a while back. I know that recently the owners were changed and I have no idea what the food was like prior to this changed, but when we went it was absolutely awful.

When we were ordering, I got a look around and the place looks honestly a bit run down and not that great. The seats are torn up and the walls are all beat up.

About 10 minutes later the waiter came back and told me the item I ordered, an Eggs Benedict, they didn't have enough ingredients for and I had to choose something else. I should have just walked out right then, but I decided to stick it through and ordered something else.

Worst mistake right there. The food was awful and the service was worse. It was also over $50 for just 2 entrees and a couple drinks, nothing else. Everything on the menu was incredibly expensive (More than it should be, I should say) and does not prove that its anywhere worthy of those prices.

Never go here. Go to village inn if you're looking for good breakfast food, or look for somewhere else that isn't here. It'll save you money and disappointment."
13241,great selection!! friendly staff. super helpful.
13242,They didnt have time for us. Said they could do surgery 4 days later. Dog would have been dead.  They did comp me the appointment
13243,Very good food if you're willing to wait for it
13244,Beautiful  cruise !
13245,"In a place that doesn't get the equipment & supplies as easily as the lower 48, this place does the trick. Everyone is professional & nice. They take good care of our needs :)"
13246,Excellent park for a short walk or long run. Best park in Anchorage in my opinion. Fun to explore always a new area
13247,Over 40 dishes to choose from and they have the best ice cream. No waiting and wasabi is great!
13248,Good for airport sushi!
13249,A bit of a wait but great service.
13250,"Very clean, and well kept. Never heard of any case of bedbugs. Staff is super friendly and the two restaurants are both upstairs and downstairs. One a pub, the other a nice local restaurant. A well known place to dine in town. They make an excellent chicken fried steak for breakfast too!"
13251,I've been a customer for my entire life and the food has always been amazing. The broad menu is great because I can always try something new! The Chorizo and the Franciscan are my favorites!
13252,"Great food. Ok prices. Love to buy my bread, and the occasional cookie/scone here."
13253,Service
13254,"This Store is getting to much .Some of the employees should be fired .I have spend so much money there and it will stop .Today a cashier actually wanted me to take my lillte PUP out of the cart sitting on a lawn pillow .Readon is Lowe's Shopping carts r so dirty and i dont want my little Shih Tzu sitting on dirt .plus it is not compftebl. Ive bought cushions and other things around $130.00.Ive told the checker let's call her the one with out a SMILE That i am buying the blue ones and leaving the green one my baby set on behind .and wy she was sitting on it with a napkin.This excuse of a woman wanted her out of the cart so WE WOULD NOT GO OUT WITH THE PILLOW I GUES .I should have put my hand down her throat and pull out her hearth .HOW CRUEL
.THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPEND AT HOME DEPO."
13255,In and out quickly
13256,"They have everything,  Well supplied complete hardware store."
13257,"Writer’s Block is such a lovely little gem, right in the heart of Spenard.  Always great tunes, delicious food and wonderful libations; including the “hard,” adult variety!  The Pelmeni is a must have for those who eat meat and if not, the Pierogi is just as swell! They have a new deck outside for you pleasure and comfort in these crazy times; or they’re down to about half capacity inside right now.  All are welcome in this place, as long as they treat other patrons with respect.  Open Wed-Fri from 10a-8p and till 5pm on Saturday/Sunday.  Masks are required for everyone’s safety but provided if you’ve recently lost yours!  Plenty of great books.  Right now carrying a great selection of aplicable books such as, “White Fragility.”"
13258,"(Translated by Google) Exceptional dinner just by the river! Definitely suggested to everyone!

(Original)
Cena eccezionale giusto in riva al fiume!decisamente suggerito a tutti!"
13259,Friendly people that make you feel at home.I've been there many times.I've always felt better after going.Go there and see for yourselfs.
13260,"Very under staffed, easily 20 minute lines in the evenings, deli has gone down severely in quality in the last 3 years. The individual crew can be friendly enough, but every one of them is obviously on edge from the bad work environment."
13261,Legit
13262,"(Translated by Google) A very characteristic town, worth visiting again.

(Original)
一個很有特色的小鎮，值得再次重遊。"
13263,Excellent service
13264,Very nice all the way around
13265,"Good food, good service."
13266,Home sweet away from home
13267,"I have been a patron for several years, lately when I go in the service is terrible. We sat for 25 minutes, they did not come over to our table until we stood up to leave. The service staff are more interested in standing and talking to eachother and being on their phones then providing water or checking to see if we want anything else. I am very disappointed in the lack of service this past year."
13268,Poor customer service at deli
13269,Great food friendly people great peaceful surroundings
13270,"Had a slow leaking tire on my truck, I stopped in and the fixed it quickly while I waited. Friendly speedy service at a good price."
13271,No selection...high prices....onky pre rolls or hibryds not worth the cost
13272,Good was decent the place was clean.. But the waitress was a little slow and they were not busy. She made me a milk shake took her forever and it had no real flavor I was disappointed.  I don't think ill be back.
13273,It's like Wally world from xmas vacation
13274,Yum
13275,Love it
13276,Large wine selection
13277,Bad service
13278,Great service and food
13279,"Oh my word. This restaurant is a wonderful celebration of the diversity of Anchorage. I've never had bone marrow served as an appetizer, but I'm so glad I tried it. Also, tons of vegetarian dishes and gluten free. They do a different gourmet burger every day, as well as a special appetizer and fish. I'll be back for sure"
13280,Good pizza duds
13281,"Great food, kind and friendly service. Nice clean dining area. A bit on the pricey side, but what in homer isn’t."
13282,It was good
13283,"I love the drinks and the people. It takes a minute for it, but it's worth it! 🤤"
13284,Beautiful scenery
13285,Best pizza in town.
13286,"As usual the food was amazing, however this time the service was not attentive and made continuous mistakes."
13287,they like sold out of almost everything with less variety of sizes. and we picked a jacket but it wasn't on sale and they said up stairs was all on sale but ended up not to be
13288,Great margaritas!
13289,Good food!!
13290,"Deep discounts on sandwich rolls and great variety of bread. I don't like the donuts.
The people are very friendly and make the mundane experience of buying bread more worthwhile. I only wish they sold hot dogs,  then I'd buy more rolls. I guess I could bring my own.
As a bonus, those small pies are an easy reward for my son"
13291,I love saving money on gas..just for shopping
13292,Great lunch place; like to go on 5 dollar friday
13293,"This place is awesome and very convenient, their clerk Nathan is the friendliest, helpful person I ever met. Thanx Nathan."
13294,"(Translated by Google) Beautiful place

(Original)
Hermoso lugar"
13295,The wait was not worth coffee that is just okay.
13296,I highly recommend  this place to anyone that is looking for a vehicle to purchase the guys working there are very nice and work with you in anyway they possibly can
13297,wonderful experience. learned a lot here. safe place for these birds of prey to heal
13298,Very farm friendly. I pull huge loads of green and fertilizer out of there all year long the service is extremely fast friendly professional. They know their business and strive to prove it. Thank you Alaska farm supply for getting me in and loaded and out of there and under an hour every time
13299,Great customer service and they can get you parts very quickly
13300,Nice quiet area
13301,Terrible pizza terrible call taker in valley super snotty
13302,Good service. Nice checkers.
13303,Fascinating
13304,"Sorry guys - I had clients stay there twice this summer, and they both said it was a solid thumbs down experience. I don't know what changed, I know people who stayed there several years ago and they all liked it. But this year, folks said it was dirty, unpleasant, rude service, disorganized and loud."
13305,Great staff. Camp Hostess was on point.
13306,Good place to stop if you need to use the restroom. Also plenty of photo opportunities. Lots of parking.
13307,Fast delivery and the best Phoenix & Dragon I have had in Anchorage.
13308,It is a Starbucks
13309,Nice place to sit and relax for a couple minutes.
13310,The coffee it tasted like it was burnt but it was really nice
13311,Used to be the Bears Den back in the day. They were alot better. This place is mediocre at best.
13312,Always super fast and friendly.
13313,Pricey but good. Only had to wait 20 minutes and they text you when your table is ready. Nice shoreside area nearby to kill time.
13314,Friendly crew
13315,I love this store. It's so cute inside and so unique!
13316,"Was expecting to get the current TV advertised special. Should have known these are for the Lower 48 only! No wonder I haven't been here for years. Average food. Prices are higher than they should be for average food. Server was very friendly and efficient. Will be many years before I return, again. I can enjoy better food for the same price and not at a chain."
13317,"This place is wonderful! The food is delicious and the price isn't half bad, not when you consider the amount of food thag you receive. Everything is made to order and the employees are kind and quick to respond to any of your questions. Did I mention that the wings come with a solid dressing of sauce?! Finally, there's a place that understands the need for sauce on wings!"
13318,Meh.
13319,"Good menu, lots of seating and close to the airport."
13320,Caesar salad is the best I ever had.
13321,The staff have been very helpful and friendly
13322,"Fun, fast flight. Hundred bucks and 20 minutes later I was in Kenai!"
13323,Long line long wait friendly staff but I had a custom order and after all that waiting it was wrong could just have been an off day for them but I give this store 3*
13324,Great FLGS. When I moved up here I was worried that it would be hard to find a great game store but I was proven wrong by Bosco's. They are everything I want in a game store and there is always someone on staff who has a personal knowledge on whatever you are looking for.
13325,Liquor dept had everything we went in for. So not bad
13326,I remember crossing this bridge every day to get to town and back home when I was a kid
13327,Breakfast 3 sausage burritos and a medium black coffee.  Very fresh
13328,"I went and absolutely loved it! They have a wide selection of Asian food (as expected) and do a really good job with Thai and Japanese noodles such as yakisoba and udon. I liked the sushi as well, however it is about average quality for the price, not mind-blowing. Their sake flight was a great way to try several different types of sake in one sitting.  The waitress was extremely helpful and we will definitely be returning soon!"
13329,"Local, close by, and good prices"
13330,"Super fresh, clean, organized looking.  Nothing like the icky store in Wasilla.  Nice, professional, clean cut looking staff.   Trade managers for awhile.  Maybe budgets too.  Lol"
13331,"I count on these pros to help in everything related to sewing, machines, and repair."
13332,"I will put the Valley Hotel and OPEN CAFE....as an absolute.....absolutely must ""STAY AND MUST MUSTLY EXPERIENCE "".....

But only if you are up in Alaska!

Better and more delightful than I possibly could have ever imagined......!

I think I will just move to a Palmer Alaska and live out the rest of my natural life.......

......just down the street and around the corner so I can enjoy the ""SOUP OF THE DAY"" every day...!"
13333,Other than no salt and pepper pks to go sux and no plastic knives wth how am I gonna cut my sandwich to the size I like at my picnic outing????
13334,Easy 2.3 mile hike to a nice overlook of the falls.
13335,Great food and service. Bartender (Laura) makes really great Mocktails!
13336,So good! Service could have been better but the food made up for it! Try the French onion soup!
13337,Sooooooo nommmmm delicious
13338,I love the service. Quick and easy. Love my S9+
13339,"Great selection of shirts, jackets, sweat tops and raincoats for men, women and children, all at a fair price. They even have a few shirts for $4.99.  Lots of other souvenirs to choose from as well. This store is very close to the docks so you don't have to walk far to shop."
13340,"The selection is actually pretty good, and the fuel is usually within a cent or two of anchorage gas stations. During the summer the hot food is always pretty fresh"
13341,Best steak in town if you don't want to pay a ton
13342,Tasty!  Awesome views
13343,"Great sandwiches! I also like their breakfast sandwiches (made fresh and not sitting under a warmer like the ""other guys""). Coffees are reasonably priced. Drive through is a plus for the busy days!"
13344,"I'm looking my stay here its un the center of everything and a fire blocks to public transportation  People Movers.
I was able to enjoy the New Year 2021 fireworks from my window, Convenience. Cant beat it!"
13345,Is the worst service I've ever had in my life that a Burger King and I have eyes if you read this post on Google Maps do not eat at the Burger King on North Way Drive the drive thru lady was so ignorant and so disrespectful and the sodas are so flat
13346,Chicken curry puffs. Dim sum. Steam buns. Yesssssss sir!
13347,Best chicken wings in Juneau. Serve up a great burger as well. Haven't had bad food here. Always friendly service.
13348,"This restaurant is on our top 5 places to eat list in Anchorage. The service is great and typically really fast. The food is amazing.

My go to meal is a small beef pho with calamari as an app.

You wouldn't know what a gem this place is by just looking at it from the outside.

This is a must go to place to eat in Anchorage."
13349,Best burgers in the valley.
13350,"prices here are sometimes hefty amd three quality isn't always the greatest, but it's a good selection of craft supplies."
13351,Nice
13352,Great place for comics and games.
13353,"It's really cool being able to get in the hot springs in the winter. The ice hotel was cool and the grounds looked amazing. That being said, the locker room and showers were too small to handle the large crowds of tourists. Plus, they looked dirty. Make sure to bring a quarter to use the lockers."
13354,Hidden gem of Mt. View.
13355,Amazing cuisine serving fresh regional favorites and chef inspired creative pairings
13356,I love the meat selection and Free samples
13357,"Went in to use a text coupon :
*Papa Murphy's: Buy Papa Murphy's Gift Card
valued @ $25.00 or more
& receieve 50% off your pizza.
Valid 12/22-12/24 *

on 12/24, first I was told ""no that coupon isn't good anymore"" then when we determined it was still active. I asked if I purchased a $25 gift card could I use it today and get 50% of my pizza paying with gift card. Was told no.

For the record I do love your pizza and am a loyal customer, but today was I felt like I was a burden and not worthy of respectful customer service."
13358,All of my favorite things are here.
13359,Shame if it's still closed
13360,Its close to where I live and I love shopping at night
13361,A very beautiful Church with very wonderful members! :)
13362,Love this place I eat here alot good food good prices and fast to!
13363,Yum!
13364,They just throw my food in the bag
13365,Goings out of business
13366,Awww yea! Love the ice cream. Also the $5 meals are pretty fantastic! Staff is friendly as expected. :)
13367,Quick cheap shopping
13368,Would give ZERO stars. An absolutely miserable company to deal with
13369,Chepito is my favorite barkeep.
13370,"Beautiful, Peaceful!"
13371,The Carr's Safeway at this location has integrated all of their natural foods in with all the regular food.  That means you have to walk through the whole store searching the shelves for the items you need that used to be located in one section of the store.
13372,Arby's  is a great fast food alternative.
13373,great food.... but had to be the worst service I have ever seen. the waitress tried to deliver the wrong food to us severall times and the waiter tried to take our order twice in five minutes. It was crazy
13374,Best beer in Anchorage. All of the owners and employees are great!
13375,"They go out of their way to help you. Kevin especially! He never seems to tire of answering my mutiple questions on parts, mystery ""sound"" etiology when an engine part in my truck is starting to malfunction, and he has no problem coming outside to identify parts on my engine, I.e. ""which one is my compressor, where is the OBD I port on this truck, does this serpentine belt seem to tight or look like it needs to be replaced, etc. He went above the call of duty to make me a ""replacement parts log"" with part numbers, brand names, and costs for my 1994 Chevy Silverado. This continuous, outstanding service is why I ALWAYS come here FIRST. I recommend them First to anyone who needs an excellent auto parts store. The manager is also wonderful and leads by example. She helped me find ""ice clearing"" wiper blades and then came out and put them on my truck. Thank you Kim!"
13376,"Product service and quility people from the owner down,and i love shopping at a family owned business"
13377,We love this place. Chicken alfredo pizza rocks. Staff is very friendly.
13378,"Excellent service, quality and details."

13380,"Lots of fish, very easy to fish. Camping"
13381,Busy and sandy
13382,The annual trek to the Alaska State Fair is a long lived tradition. Gobs & Gobs of people. The fair food is always phenomenal and the variety is bar none.

13384,"(Translated by Google) There's no snow in the summer, so I can't run a ski resort.

13385,The drinks where good. The live band sounded amazing but a boring and slow.
13386,"It's a typical McDonald's. Sometimes good, sometimes not. Typically pretty clean and fast."
13387,One of the best breakfast places in the valley. Always good food and service.
13388,"ALWAYS fast, ALWAYS good! When I need a fries fix Wendy's is the place to go!"
13389,"I walked in and a lady sitting in an office chair through a hallway turns, looks at me, then turns back around. When I finally do get into the part of the store everything was very overpriced, $20.00 a gram for midgrade weed. I went down the street and got a some bud that was 26% for $10. Double the price half the service I will not be back"

13391,Great food good prices easy parking will revisit soon !!!
13392,Great picnic grounds and place for dogs to roam and let loose!
13393,"There's always great produce you can't find anywhere else in town. The deli is hot and fresh. The bakery is yummy. And the cheese is delightful.
The grocery is the place to go to find all your looking for in Asian cooking or even just snacks.
There also cookware. It's a one stop shop!
And don't forget the fresh seafood."
13394,"Eaten there twice this week. Coffee is forgettable but everything else is good. Hearty portions, friendly service."
13395,"CASH ONLY! (They do have an ATM on site.) I used the shower facilities only, but it was a great experience. The staff was super friendly, the showers we're clean, and it was super easy. A little pricey at almost $6, but still worth the money. I will use them again. They appear to have excellent laundry facilities as well."
13396,"I stopped by a few other places in town before my visit to Trek bicycles. Katie truly gave my wife and I a phenomenal customer service experience. It didn't feel like she was just trying to sell us something that wasn't for us
she informed us about different types of bike and how every trek bike is customizable towards the individual. I see why the rating on this business is so high. Would suggest to anyone looking for a quality bike."
13397,Love the owner such a person
13398,Nice place. Great for bird viewing.
13399,Good selection of food.

13402,Good job on service and food
13403,Nice People Friendly Church
13404,Peter Pan is always amazing every time I go there the food is fresh and hot off the grill and the people are friendly!!!
13405,"An amazing small business with friendly staff and a great selection of various photography equipment, from cameras, lenses, and stands to GoPros and mounts, developing services, and camera bags."
13406,THE OXTAIL PHO WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.. TWO PIECES OF SMALL OXTAIL..
13407,Great food and excellent service. The only reason I don't give it five stars is the level of the music in the restaurant.
13408,Love this place good prices awesome workers
13409,It's just ok.
13410,Food was delicious. Waiting was long like usual but we kept each other busy . 😃
13411,"Places like this should be put out of business and forced to close down because they are responsible for at least 30 lb of my excess weight, LOL"
13412,"I was looking for a birthday present for a 3 year old and she likes Paw Patrol so I went to the Old Seward one it wasn't there, then A St Walmart it wasn't there soo Debarr I was, it wasn't there. I headed to Eagle River Walmart and there it was! The very last one!"
13413,Beautiful! Feels more remote than it really is!

13418,Good food
13419,Great service. Great work.  Great samples.
13420,"Went into Spenards looking for a stainless steel gas range with a convection oven. I was on a limited budget and up to now I wasn't happy with what I'd seen in other stores. I gave Virginia Bell a rough idea of what I wanted and within minutes she pulled up a range that checked all the boxes, plus it black stainless steel. On top of that she set it up for next day delivery for free! Thanks Virginia, good luck on your fishing trip!"
13421,"Not very good.
The taste is just greasy and bland.
There are many other pizza options at this price point that's better."
13422,The fried chicken is the best we've had in Alaska yet. They are sure to get a good crunch on the chicken without overwhelmingly thick breading. The shakes are also pretty deadly...
13423,Food was just awesome and the service was warm and homely. Thouroughly enjoyed the experience of a hearty lunch
13424,The deli is superb and they have the best doughnuts. Beware of the bathrooms.
13425,Great accessories n parts for bikes i buy new tire n they change them for free
13426,"Has almost everything a nerd could want, some things are kinda pricey but that's to be expected and the employees are awesome."

13434,Always helpful!
13435,Decent food but not a good value for the price. Good atmosphere and nice service though.
13436,Always a great meal and good price!
13437,"Neon bowling was fun, something and adult and teen can both enjoy. Clean place, nice employees"
13438,Its QDOBA they are all the same. People here are rude though. So there's that.
13439,This is the the best restaurant in Anchorage and I've been to them all. Just go.
13440,"Awesome sandwiches and soups with tons of options for making exactly what you want, a bit on the pricier side for a sandwich though."
13441,"Great pizza, amazing view and well worth the price. Lovely atmosphere and great staff. I've been twice and both times were great. I highly recommend this if you love aviation and pizza, even if you dont it's worth every penny to give it a try!"
13442,I stopped in to get some spring rolls which almost all Asian places offer.  Not this one.  Their menu is limited and prices higher than expected.
13443,Great t-shirts to choose from and awesome gifts
13444,Quick fast service was greeted with a smile the food was excellent warm
13445,Very clean and always fresh Chinese food
13446,"One foot long is two meals for me. It was so packed with veggies and meat with cheese! Exactly how i asked. Very polite, consistent and fast."
13447,"UPDATE: tonight is our last night here at this amazing extended stay. They were very accommodating with making sure to provide us with kitchen supplies. I received multiple emails from me Jennifer making sure we were okay and although I didn’t respond I did want to say thank you for making our trip comfortable and worry free. Your establishment is very clean, your staff are personable and are always willing to help, even if they are not sure, they go out of their way to find out for me. Our room was spacious and clean. Beds are so very comfortable, I found it difficult to get out of them at times lol. I’m sad I have to return home to Virginia but best believe that when I tell the folks back home of my Alaska trip, the Aptel Studio Hotel will be included! When I come back I WILL stay here again, without a doubt!

Thank you so very much for being a part of this memorable experience.

Okay, so on oct 19th i will be coming up to Alaska from Virginia Beach to visit family and our family home, and will be staying for 14 days... it is been over 19 years since I have been back I had another booking with a different hotel. I decided on this one because of the kitchenette. Before I canceled my previous booking with the other hotel. I spoke to a wonderful young lady. I had a concern about check in. It noted that check in ends at 10:30 pm. My flight is supposed to land before that but I have to pick up my rental car. She eased my mind and told me it was fine that I could just call and let security know I’m checking in from a flight. She was so lovely and I’m excited to stay here. However, I read the reviews just now and see a few complaint about not having kitchen supplies... the kitchenette was the main reason for choosing this place. I seen the staff reply to one review stating they do have supply boxes but it is limited, I do hope there are some available when we get there in two weeks. I already spent an insane amount to even make this trip possible... I’d hate to buy kitchen supplies that I won’t even be bringing back with me afterwards... I’ll update review once we arrive/after our stay. Crosses fingers/here’s hoping!!"
13448,Usually really enjoy South for dinner and brunch. Often have to wait to be seated. Sit at the bar and converse with the bartenders if you don't have a big party!
13449,Great dinner.
13450,"Great trip for New Year Eve
Talkeetna Alaska. What a site to see!!"
13451,"It’s Costco,duh!!!"
13452,"Arrived 40 minutes prior to closing to grab some quick eats and staff turned us away as they said they were closing up. He said only grubhub and online orders were being accepted, so we considered ordering from the parking lot, but didn’t since we were unwelcomed in store. Nothing online or in the store mentioned closing early. Could have been handled better. Wouldn’t recommend on service alone."
13453,"We has just arrived in town, this place was a short walk from our hotel and the parking lot was packed.Our waitress' name was Jennifer and she was great. Friendly, prompt and well aware of menu items. Salad bar was awesome(large fresh selection), so was clam chowder and shrimp salad."
13454,Kids loved it!! We played for 3 or 4 hours!!
13455,Love this store!
13456,Best mall in town
13457,Massage amazing!!!
13458,"Very good, freshly cooked food, Good sized portions. Will be back!"
13459,All of it's a wonderful place.
13460,Great way to spend a few bucks when watching something they usually kill it
13461,"First time I went through the drive through the soda I got was terrible... Too much carbonation...I had to go back through to get a meal for a friend... They replaced my drink with one that tasted better... But instead of giving me a Sprite for my friend, turned out to be iced tea"
13462,The place seems ancient and has a weird smell. The employees are nice and it's Pizza Hut so you know what you're getting.
13463,its walmart what do you expect
13464,The food and service were good.  Prices were reasonable too.
13465,88000 trails. 0 trail markers
13466,Open 24 got me.
13467,There is a burger shack here that is delicious! The marina is nice and the boat launch is well kept.
13468,Love this place
13469,4 Lokos
13470,"Love all the great ideas I get, when I shop here!!"
13471,It's a mall.
13472,"Local favorite.  Good food, desserts"
13473,Love it
13474,Best chicken I've ever tasted.
13475,All the bartenders are great super friendly.
13476,"Interesting site.  Loved the runway and the planes.  The office staff would be more knowledgeable if they actually knew the layout of the RV spots. We encountered one that didn't. The restaurant was a long wait, which we would have understood if the host had taken time to say that they were short staffed, rather than us discover on our own. Didn't see the hot springs, thought it was a bit odd to go through the pool, but maybe next time."
13477,I was almost crawling when my back went out. Jenn the office manager was very friendly and compassionate in getting me help. Dr. Mel worked with me on a payment program I could afford and got me walking again in 3 visits and even offered to come in on his day off to get me ready for work. I would strongly recommend this location.
13478,"Good vegan lunch options, unfortunately vegan breakfast options weren't quite as exciting. Friendly service and fun outdoor seating with a personal backyard feel."
13479,The waiter we had was very nice. The restaurant itself was also pleasant.
13480,"I love this place.

I asked a girl on a date 10 years ago and of course I brought her here because it was affordable with good food. 7 years after that I asked her to merry me in king's parking lot right behind the sign. We've spent all our anniversaries dinners here, but this time with our new born.

This restuarant and its food deserve my 5 stars and more. Thanks for the great service for all these years."
13481,Good personal service
13482,Great place for drinks n dinner
13483,I love the people and the room
13484,Helped with a cell phone now I can't get help at all and i pay for the warranty. I live this store but it really is a downer.
13485,Staffed by friendly locals this venue hosts a wide array of local and traveling talents. The only reasons I don't give it a five-star is due to lack of any dancing floor space and sound quality issues on more than one occasion
13486,The best coffee in Alaska!
13487,"The employees' hospitality make it worth coming back. Otherwise, its nothing special compared to other movie theatres. Something I really dont like is how you have to wait in line to refill your drink/popcorn. They should have a separate line for this so that youre not missing your movie; especially because those snack lines get pretty long and they only have 2-3 employees working. It would also be nice if they posted that they dont charge for a 2yr old in the Standard movie rooms. This wouldve saved me some money, on all the previous times, before one of the employees mentioned it."
13488,nice place to visit
13489,Staff was very helpful and knowledgeable.  With Covid happening I was forced to color my roots myself.  Staff assisted me with everything I needed and tips to get the job done right.
13490,"What amazing service and the fresh wood fired food was delicious! We got garlic bread knots and they were so fluffy and buttery. Then our made-to-order pizzas were perfect and came out hot and fresh. I love wood fired pizza and it was perfect. We loved being able to have our own pizzas made to our preferences. Plus the beer, cider, and root beer on tap was the right compliment to the food."
13491,"Expansive, poor service."
13492,Very friendly and helpful happy employees
13493,Couldn't say enough good things about these guys! Seriously they detailed my son n laws truck for I think around $50 compared to other area detailers at $200+. They were so nice and done such an amazing job. Nice clean big waiting room and they worked us n2 the schedule last minute as well
13494,Milkshakes pretty legit
13495,"Disappointing at best. Few customers, but overwhelmed server. Spoke with chief, who obviously eats all leftovers, amazed he fit threw doorway. I dressed appropriate for Palmer, and was ignored. Have lived in Germany for 3 years and enjoyed the people, the country and customs, and food to be amazing. However this establishment is like a McDonald's for German food, and priced like it is a fine dining element."
13496,"Very friendly, great with getting to-go orders ready, and always safety first."
13497,"Barnes & Noble is the only national chain bookstore in Alaska. This location is small compared to many locations in the lower 48, but it is the best you will find for browsing new books in Anchorage. To browse used books try Title Wave Books."
13498,Excellent service and one of my favorite stores.
13499,"This is the place to go.
So go already!"

13510,"Super nice and helpful staff!

Ask them about their magic trick!"
13511,Dr Cates helped us get our two schnauzers move to UK. The process and paperwork we're alot but Dr. Cates and staff correct filled them out making the move easier.
13512,Amazing! Great place
13513,WOW! Come see and listen to the thunder and watch it calving!
13514,"Our favorite restaurant in Anchorage. The chef is brilliant, has awesome fair, and great appetizers. The cocktails are also cool. And it's next to the overrated Moose's tooth, so if you have a 45-minute wait you can just pop on into kinley's"
13515,"(Translated by Google) The customer service is very cordial and I think they are good at their job the truck is working well the automatic ignition.

(Original)
El servicio al cliente es muy cordial y creo que son buenos en su trabajo la camioneta esta trabajando bien el encendido automático."
13516,Convenient location.
13517,"Best pizza in town, if not state."
13518,Lots of fun things to do here.
13519,"Friendly staff, a lot to offer."
13520,"When this place is good, it's my favorite restaurant.  When it's bad, I can't eat it.  And company policy on paying for sauces (like Zaxby's) is a poor model."
13521,Excellent airport
13522,OMG delicious!
13523,Very tasty.
13524,Great facility
13525,"We went as a big group for a work function,  the service was good and the hostess seemed to be keeping up with the whole group when it came to water.  But really not much passed that.  The food itself for the buffet price 9f 12.50 was good and would go again."
13526,Food and service are excellent!
13527,I love to fish and hunt and I enjoy being in the elements of Alaska. This place is great for all your essentials you could or will need to enjoy Alaska's  outdoors.
13528,The rooms are nice and the shuttle driver-Android provides good service and pickups from the train depot!
13529,You need it? They more than likely got it. Knowledgeable staff. Bring cash and more than likely get a discount .
13530,New and clean! Nice staff and good prices. Awesome View!
13531,Well since we only have two movie theaters here in Juneau it's one of the other
13532,"Prices were ridiculous but the service was fast and the server really cared for my Dad, she was friendly and kind as was the busser."
13533,Their macaroons are always delicious and fun flavors. Service is excellent.
13534,Had an afternoon snack with my daughter. Waitress was very nice and attentive. We left smiling!
13535,Awesome Service and Delicious Tasting American-Italian Foods
13536,Great food
13537,"My personal experience, at Kendall their employees are fast friendly and reliable customer service they are always on point. 👍 and let me tell ya I don't give praise to people who don't deserve it...  😌 golden rule ""treat others the way you would like to be treated"""
13538,Very helpful staff!!
13539,Great service! So family oriented
13540,It's okay food is still amazing but prices are still expensive the one in Michigan is cheaper than up here in Alaska
13541,Great customer service
13542,Great place
13543,Famous Wok has great food..Thanks
13544,The pizza wasn't what we expected. The mushroom and pineapple toppings were canned and the rest of the flavor wasnt anything special.  The staff was nice and the restaurant was clean.
13545,Excellent
13546,Beautiful
13547,Good food
13548,"It was supposed to take 2 hours to change my oil.  They were supposed to have a shuttle. I had to sign up for the shuttle, and it was supposed to take 45 minutes for the driver to get back. I get a call that the shuttle driver was back after 1 and 1/2 hours, but I was in the restroom and missed the call.  I called the shuttle driver back after 4 minutes, but he had already left again, and he said he would be back after 45 minutes (not believable).  At that time, since my truck was supposed to be done in 30 minutes, I went to check on it, and it was nowhere near done.  No information provided by the dealer was even remotely accurate."
13549,"Services was good, food was not so good and the bill scary high. Lesson learned."
13550,Good food
13551,"The food is so good I really want to give this place 5 stars but, they cannot estimate wait times for pickup or delivery reliably, I've had to wait 20 minutes for my pickup order when there where only two customers in the entire restaurant.  They commonly forget sides and condiments, and the staff is rude. Great food though."
13552,Restaurant was nice and clean and the staff very attentive and good food
13553,Great dispensary and service for Cannabis
13554,"Good food and coffee, unfortunately I can't come here often because I just spent $4.75 on a London fog."

13563,"Nice haircut..friendly, down-to-earth earth staff. They make you feel right at home!
I learned some interesting history facts from talking with my barber while getting my hair cut. I had to pay in cash which I wasn't prepared for but it worked out."
13564,Great place to check out free parking.
13565,They are very loving and kind and helpful during a personal crisis!
13566,"Over the past few months I have very rarely not had an issue with my order not being correct... Also to find out the prices via the Taco Bell app are not the same and in fact cheaper if used... What also doesn't make sense is even after placing an app order you check in via the app to say your there, when you go inside people who came in after you get their food before you do... When you ask the employee become huffy... Thinking of contacting corporate to let them know the staff they have..."
13567,"Great turf for the kids, love the running track, and the ice skating is fantastic."
13568,Great sandwiches and bakery
13569,Awesome
13570,This is a great place to eat. Nice family setting with a friendly staff.  They have a open salsa and drink bar.

13581,Is my best place in anchorage
13582,The food here is absolutely amazing. The pizza is the best i have ever eaten the greek salad is out of the world. You have to try a super sub. The dining space is huge great for a  christmas party or any event with allot of people. This is my favorite place in Anchorage to eat. The service is amazing. I cant say enough about how impressed I am with Guidos.
13583,Friendly staff great subs.  I plan on returning soon.
13584,"Excellent food,  service,  and drinks"

13600,There is a lot of wilderness animals on the loose. It is an awesome view of Mount McKinley surrounded by clouds.
13601,Love coming in for lunch! Always a nice relaxing and cheery atmosphere and good food!
13602,"Nice low price hotel. It's old and has stairs no elevator. Pretty inside. The room I stayed in with one bed, I enjoyed.  Cute and comfy bed.  Happy I had Wi-Fi to go online and enjoyed watching cable TV last night.  Room was to hot but thankfully I could open both windows to cool down. Liked that walking distance was from hotel. Banks walking distance and few places to eat. I would definitely stay again if I needed a place to stay."
13603,Always my favorite  govt office to  visit!!!! People are always so nice !!!!
13604,Wish it was closer to my house
13605,Food not fresh  didnt seem to like my service dog there even tho she goes right under table and lays down
13606,The shrimp and grits were pretty good. Limited menu and the service was pretty slow.
13607,"There's nothing  better than a drive down the Turn again Arm, it's a coastal  inlet that's Magestically Glorious. ♡"
13608,The rice bowls and house salad are fantastic and always good quality.

13610,"**Pictures of Full Menu Here***
HAND SANITIZER AT EVERY TABLE!!
What a great place to go. Definitely following the covid and social distancing guidelines. A big and full menu. You are sure to find something that you will love. Awesome and friendly staff. Good atmosphere.  Had no problem answering questions or even wiping down our table again, as we asked. My friend ordered a diet coke and the ox tail phone. He said is was delicious.  I personally couldn't belive how big thr bowl for the phone was. I ordered the pork Lao sausage.  It was a little spicy but not too bad. The stick rice and veggies it came with, helped with that. I also had a Thai iced tea. Both were very yummy. Im so glad it went.  I am sure you will be too."
13611,Beautiful park.  Great trails for summer or winter.  Such vast natural beauty in the city is amazing.
13612,Love Carrs. Not to fond of the employees
13613,This place is amazing! Definitely worth a visit. So far the crumb donut is my favorite but all the ones we tried are delicious. The White Mouse (?) Coffee was delicious too!
13614,"If you're looking for the lower 48 taste in breakfast, this is it."
13615,Fun trip
13616,"Friendly staff, good selection!"
13617,Every time I go it seems one thing or another doesn't work to clean my truck and it is pretty expensive at $16 when it's not doing what it's supposed to do! I came out one day and my tailgate had not even been touched I watched it it never sprayed it at all! Another time the door wouldn't even open after I put my money in it! So I never got my truck washed at all!
13618,Always leave with a full belly
13619,Loves this ❤️
13620,Chalupa box great stuff
13621,Amazing food and service
13622,"Best ever!!
Local store friendliness with big store products.
Can't wait for summer plants and chickens."
13623,Meatballs was hard and spaghetti was horrible
13624,"Great service, good drinks, and good food!"
13625,"Great icecream! But I also go their to tip the employees. Those girls are always patient, hard working, and friendly. Fabulous job hiring!!"
13626,"Food was great.  Service was excellent.  Had the mushroom fritters for starters and the ribs of course for the meal.  Everything tasted great and the place had a great atmosphere too.  Was our first time, but definitely plan on returning!"
13627,All my shopping needs
13628,Good place clean and good stuff
13629,High priced! You spend as much as a regular restaurant. Food is ok but the wait is worse than for a sit down meal.
13630,Amazing!
13631,"Service was prompt, pleasant, and professional. The restaurant was clean and our food came out fast enough that my 4yr old didn't get super antsy. I'd say it was a perfect 10, but I'll go with 9 since my pasta was rather bland and a bit over cooked. We will be back, and I'll order something else. 👍"
13632,I do the subscription and I find that the fifth avenue location and the old Seward location near Tudor give me the best results.
13633,Very interesting 'store'
13634,"Highly qualified and professional doctors, specialists and staff. I have been a patient here on and off for years  but recently I've been working with Dr. Lorenz since 2015.  I have a relatively complicated situation, and have had experienced a lot of discrimination and negative bedside manner when doctors could not diagnose the problem.  I've only had positive experiences with this organization.  Dr. Lorenz has taken great care to determine the best course of action, if any is necessary, and is great at ensuring that the patient understands the information that is necessary for their health. The only drawback, if you feel the need for one, is that the location is in a medical office area on the north edge of downtown where most people don't travel to very often.  Access to the area is great, and there is plenty of parking on street, adjacent to the building if the parking lot is ever full.   And sometimes you have to wait a month out for an appointment.  If you need a specialist, I'd surely recommend these folks first."
13635,"Basic but serviceable pizza. The topping are generous, the cheese is good, but the sauce and crust are only okay. 24/7 service a plus light at night."
13636,I like the setup they have here and they always have the movies the valley doesn't. (Like once upon a deadpool)
13637,Good customer service.  Good visit.
13638,Best icecream in Wasilla
13639,"Standard burger chaintaurant fare, service was spotty even though the dinning room was mostly empty."
13640,Large variety of healthy stuff.
13641,These folks have our business from now on!!
13642,"Great service, kind staff. Rooms were clean and the view was great."
13643,A little pricey but awesome food and service!!
13644,"Great for midtown workers to stop by and take a walk on their lunch break. Nice scenery and clean trails. A lot of drunks seem to like to do their day drinking here though, and you would think that a place that's catered to kids would have patrols, but it doesn't."
13645,A bit pricey. It would be nice if they have points reward or dividends for purchases.
13646,"It's Walmart, it's freaking huge and it's the only one in town.   Word to the wise don't steal here. Fairbanks PD love posting photos of the idiots on Facebook."
13647,Beautiful
13648,Fast check out good selection
13649,"Great place if you want real food, from real people who aren't trying to do fake diner upscale stuff... Just real diner food that you like, then this is the place to go.  Probably my favorite everyday place to go to eat."
13650,"Cadillac margarita is on point, pizza is ok."
13651,You must try steam dot yogurt!
13652,Ok
13653,Found each item I needed
13654,One stop place for complete Alaska history
13655,Excellent bacon double stackers 🍔  & fries  🍟 with a frosty  🍦.
13656,Best burger in anchorage
13657,This is often a go to place for our family but today was a sad day. The service was awful and borderline rude. And there was plastic in our food.
13658,Favorite place for animal supplies and garden supplies
13659,"Very creative flavors with fresh ingredients.  Highly recommended, especially when you want something a little different."
13660,Goog
13661,"Cool atmosphere, great bakery and our server had swagger"
13662,Amazing just amazing
13663,I have never had a situation where this app worked perfectly. If you really want a mapping hand held get a Garmin
13664,"Wont be going to there again...staff has time and again not gotten the order right, snobby and front staff older ladies talking in foreign language....felt like I was at a nail salon where they smile to your face but their smile doesnt reach their eyes. This time it was just a happy meal with apple slices...simple but nope got it wrong again."
13665,Great location and the staff are really helpful. They aren't pushy either it's a very relaxed shopping environment.
13666,"Easily, without a doubt, the best Mexican food in Alaska.  The service, the chips & salsa, the margaritas... all of it is consistently amazing.  We go back time and time again and have yet to be disappointed."
13667,The teachers are awesome!!! My baby expresses his feelings!!! Definitely glad he is going here. If you have a chance to bring your child here don't hesitate!!!
13668,Fail... pass on this place.
13669,Give a book as a gift
13670,"Best pharmacy around, really looks after their customers ❤"
13671,Fair and HONEST guys
13672,Great food in and out salads
13673,Thank you carrs for being there for us
13674,Beautiful atmosphere. Comfortable regulated temperatures. Easy to get around and find our interior destination. Will definitely go again when the time arrives.
13675,Quick fast service
13676,"Family owned great price and really nice set up with seeing the dog sledding,sea plane and the native village!"
13677,"I've been coming to this spot close to six years now. I can honestly say I get a great hair cut everytime at a fair and reasonable price. I highly recommend you check in online. The staff are always friendly, give great advice on hair upkeep and have got a great sense humour. The manager is who I always request as she cuts my hair perfectly. There is another lady, I don't like putting names out there on these reviews, that cuts my hair perfectly too. So, if the manager isn't there I'll have her cut my hair. That said, the entire staff is great and skillful at their craft and anyone of them could cut my hair easily and just as perfect. I'm just picky and like these two ladies specifically to cut my hair. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get a great hair cut."
13678,Awesome.. enjoyed my grandson 5th birthday party. The staff was very nice and helpful.
13679,It helps with legal issues
13680,"Beautiful hotel with great views, great downtown location with access to all downtown Anchorage has to offer but be sure to go downstairs to look at the wall murals INSIDE the Captain Cook. Best hotel in Anchorage!"
13681,The ambiance of this place is loud and obnoxious. The food was overpriced and underwhelming. The service was poor due to an overworked waiter. Our view was of the back of another building. One extra star for having decent beer.
13682,The staff are friendly and the prices reasonable.  I like that I am not fighting 100 people to get to a check out stand.  Always my go to place for groceries
13683,I have loved stars of Alaska if I found it 5 years ago. The store has any and every type of Agate or Crystal that you can think of offhand. They had dishes fashioned out of agate wind chimes with crystals dream catchers with feathers. And then they have antique glass and Oriental antiques from the war that have swords that jewelry dishes toys absolutely anything! But... they also have a woman who considers herself the utmost Authority on everything to the point of being rude to a young girl. I've also noticed over the last year-and-a-half her merchandise has almost doubled in price and last year at the State Fair when asked if she had any materials used for smudging abruptly snapped at me and said no and then when I showed her an example of what she had on display she argues with me telling me that's not what that was! At the State Fair she made herself look like an ass while she was trying to make me look like an ass! Not to mention she tried to charge me $20 for charcoal absurd lady
13684,I enjoyed my wings. Very tasty
13685,Just had a quick drink at Fletcher's.  The service is always good there.
13686,"Food here is very good.  Wish they would train their servers to pay attention to the customers, then I would come more often.  If you don't get coffee (which they bring with a carafe), you might as well give up on drink refills."
13687,There was a man without a mask who thoroughly harrassed me. However I did have a fine traveling experience
13688,"Not the best, but its okay for the money."
13689,Max never burns the bread!
13690,"Nice place to find the right good for natives, Asian food are almost like native food."
13691,"Amazing coffee , I had one of the best cappuccinos I ever had in my life here
The bagel with berry cream cheese it's sooooooo good !
And they are open from 6am which I guess it's the only place around starting early! Kudos!"
13692,"This is buy far the largest, cleanest, most well run Walmart I have ever been to in all 50 states."
13693,I've never been able to stick to a work out consistently or at all. I would get to the gym and remain clueless. These instructed one hour work outs with high accountability help me push  myself to MY limits based on my own heart rate monitored on the leaderboard. I'd give this new locally ran business a try because the first class is free and there's no year long contract to buy out if you decide it's not for you.
13694,Great food and service
13695,Great service and have friendly of children  also
13696,The best pizza place!! Ingredients are fresh. Food is great. Friendly environment and staff. Family friendly as well.
13697,"It's McDonald's, the one on Geist is way better"
13698,Always willing to spend a lot of money there. The staff is super knowledgeable and make great recommendations.
13699,Great food and service
13700,"Hands down, best pizza in town. We've tried so many places. Most was okay but left you disappointed. Tuscana has yet to disappoint. Been eating there for 2 years now. Try the Italian sub too. Incredible."
13701,"They have the basics, but not they size to hold enough variety."
13702,Great place for what you need!!
13703,Quite and  easy.
13704,"Wonderful relaxed vibe. My pedi was with Chelsea, very pleasant and professional young lady. Excellent service."

13708,Very friendly clean homey
13709,OWNER IS A JERK (BEING POLITE) BUT THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT!!!!!
13710,Great chicken tenders with honey mustard made at Store
13711,They told me they don't use breading on their wings. Well they do. So there goes 30 bucks
13712,The heat wasn't working properly last time we visited so that made for a chilly setting! But there are nice snacks and wine/beer selection and we had a lot of fun watching the production. I do wish the chairs wrapped a bit more around the stage so that you didn't have to crane your neck to see the stage when sitting at the far ends. Know that they are new to this location and hoping they get all the details worked out.
13713,They have the festival here every year and the kids enjoy the face painting booth and a few of the shows as well
13714,Efficient
13715,Great deals and excellent product.
13716,Fun time
13717,It's Taco Bell
13718,"Great people, fast service."
13719,This place is so over priced! I think it's pathetic what they charge for second hand stuff. This store is a joke.
13720,"Love this place. Cozy, cute, friendly."
13721,Everything is so fresh
13722,Sign King seems to get our graphics on time and the right fit for our needs
13723,"Lulu's make good breads and bagels, though it is slightly expensive."
13724,"Honestly, it's consistently the best pizza I've ever had."
13725,Clear Creek Dental is fantastic. Very nice staff and professional.
13726,Great place for kids of all places.
13727,Great Company !
13728,A bookworms paradise fabulous range of intelligent tombs housed in a charming historic gouse and garden and presided over by a pair of charmers
13729,Good good bad service
13730,"This park is just great,that's all I can say."
13731,The best place for breakfast they made my eggs perfect. I enjoy eating there
13732,"If what we stayed in was a ""suite"" then  I'd hate to see what their normal rooms are like. One lady that helped us was extremely rude, other than that everyone else was nice."
13733,Extremely slow service
13734,Horrible food and service
13735,nice atmosphere and good beer
13736,"Had lunch here. Shrimp, halibut, and stuffed mushrooms. Overall we thought the food was just average. Batter was a bit heavy and the food was greasey and a little undercooked. Expected more for the price."
13737,"The food here is always tasty. The downside sometimes the person serving you doesn't speak english and none of the food is labeled. I always end up guessing and pointing the food I want, but it hasn't let me down yet!"
13738,Great happy hour appetizers!
13739,Amazing views during any season
13740,SO GOOD!!!
13741,"Nice store, well kept. The selection is good, the prices vary. Staff are friendly, just in there own little worlds. May return, they have a awesome clearance selection."
13742,Very nice and helpful.   The doctor explained everything to me and it made so much sense!
13743,Beautiful view. The glacier was breathtaking and if you drive always you can see so much more.
13744,"The restaraunt is very clean and has a very nice aesthetic to it.
The staff are very friendly and the food is great.
Whenever I am in the mood for great mexican food, I come here."
13745,My go to place for just about anything.
13746,Lowe's is the place I go when I need something for the House
13747,"Fantastic place to meet for lunch. The Avocado Duet, and the Halibut Taco's are amazing."
13748,Dirty
13749,Great I got my hair cut exactly how I wanted it. I'll ve going back there.
13750,I have had to use Alaska Airline's Goldstreak service many times for my employer. The level of service I have received from the staff is second to none.
13751,Best bar tenders
13752,"Delicious food, delightful baked goods, and a traditional-style approach to Chinese food. My family has visited this restaurant for years and it doesn't disappoint. Sometimes we just stop in just to get some Pineapple cheese cake or a few slices of Boston cream pie (and always a jelly roll!) for special occasions. The menu is huge, but it would be nice to see some new items occasionally rotated into the baked goods selections. While its reassuring to have old favorites constantly available, a rotating special would be great."
13753,Really busy but good selection
13754,Warm place to spend the night while visiting Denali Park. Great place to view the northern lights.
13755,❣️
13756,"Great place to take a stroll and visit, Alaska beauty and interesting"
13757,Great smoothies
13758,Wasilla store not so good. Long wait at the pharmacy every time. Long lines at the checkout. Employee's seem unhappy. Lots of stuff though.
13759,"I stayed there over Christmas 2015 while visiting family.  The hotel is ok but pretty dated.  The room that I was in was clean but had things like a broken thermostat, dead plug in, etc.  They could spend some more time on maintenance.  Also the complementary breakfast was not very good and they are extremely rude about the vouchers for the food."
13760,Nice big bathtub I'm 6ft tall and I was able to fit in it just fine
13761,"Good affordable bar to play throw some darts, make good conversation, play some pool, and"
13762,I enjoy staying here. The rooms are clean and decorated tastefully. There's even a small refrigerator to keep small items cold. The lounge is great for a post-dinner drink and they serve food from the restaurant as well. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
13763,Beautiful.
13764,Food was ok price is way too high
13765,"New owner, new name.  Great great food and drinks.  Try the Tan Tan!"
13766,"Well you guessed it, its McDonald's. Pretty snappy service but in. North pole you pay tax and Alaska in general is more expensive so there isnt a dollar menu but still a quick and cheap lunch for the kiddos. I wish they'd bring back the big salads."
13767,Food was slammin! Oysters of course and great entrees
13768,"Not much to say, basic hotel, for this price okay."
13769,very easy to get opts. i live vet. ron hes been our family vet over 20 yrs
13770,Was good we stayed when we went down fishing
13771,"Staff was great and prompt, good experience!"
13772,Good food!
13773,"So pretty, hikes and wildlife."
13774,Have enjoyed there food for 10 years at least
13775,Hope the future's brighter for your business
13776,"I like this place it is reasonable and close to my house.
Will take my dogs on short notice and put up with one that likes to show his teeth."
13777,Ok
13778,I always find what I am looking for!
13779,Best place to sit back and enjoy your favorite meal whole watching a movie
13780,"45 min wait to the airport? Don't waste your time dealing with these taxis. The last time I traveled I ordered one a day in advance and it was an hour late. better to organize a ride,shuttle or walk. Would put zero stars but it's not an option."
13781,Hospitality is amazing. Rooms and views are so warming and romantic. Still want to make an unforgettable romantic memory here.
13782,"My son ordered the Southerm Pecan waffle, he got it within 10 minutes. At the same time  they brought out his food they brought out my supposedly Berries and Cream waffle with no berries. It took about another 30 minutes before they brought my husband and my food out. I had the berries and cream waffle that came with bacon eggs and has brown. They brought out the same waffle they had first brought out that they rewarmed in the microwave and I knw that because it was hard as heck and stuck to the paper plate they serve the food on and the fruit on the waffle was rotten. The has brown and eggs were good and it was seasoned good. The bacon had a rough chew like it was rewarmed in the microwave too. My husband had the Dixie chix waffle. He said it was good. My sons southern pecan waffle was super sweet so be sure if you order that to get a cup of water. My thoughts on this place is they need to hire another waitress. The lady that took our order was kept forgetting what people wanted. I don't think they have a serving tray because t
She had to bring one plate then go back get another plate. She said she couldn't carry more than two plates. They serve the drinks in paper cups with no lids."
13783,"Good location. Burlington, Fred Meyer and Planet Fitness all in the same location. Good parking."
13784,Just awesome place to shop friendly and fast thank you
13785,Not as good as I thought it was going to be.
13786,It's all about the lengua.
13787,Thing to fix up life.
13788,Good bargains. Decent variety. But not very tidy.
13789,Smaller variety and more expensive than Michael's.
13790,The best view possible.
13791,"Slow service,but good drink."
13792,Great store and good qualitt
13793,Good location employees are very helpful
13794,"After moving to Eielson Feb of 2017 I can honestly say the rec area has been one of my favorite places to ride ATVs. Well groomed trails with amazing views, nice cabins, and very well marked trails. I've ridden at many places, and I'm still amazed at how well the trails placed, and kept. Plenty of adventure to be had, while not having to worry about getting lost. A++++"
13795,Always decent diner food
13796,Highly recommend this place!  Our flight experience was awesome!  The whole experience was about 2 hours.  We took off in a rainy day but the pilot did an awesome job navigating the weather to make sure we had a great experience.  I was fortunately to sit right next to the pilot so my view was awesome.  We flew over several mountains in the south part of the Mount Denali and eventually was lucky to see the highest peak in North America!  Then we landed on a glacier and took a bunch of pictures on the snow!  It is not cheap for the whole thing but I highly recommend it if you can afford it!
13797,I reccomend the butte
13798,"Food was hot, fresh and flavorful."
13799,"Great little diner set back on the side of a low building, kind of hard to see from the road especially if your heading into town. If you pass the end of the runway and see the lake you went to far. Has a adequate breakfast and lunch menu with rain deer sausage pancakes hash browns and of course bacon and eggs. The wait staff are friendly and know the area well if you a new visitor and you might see a bush plane or float plane take off if you grab a window booth"
13800,Good selection
13801,Fanstatic site
13802,24 hour access. Plenty of machines.  Great gym.
13803,Interesting
13804,Great service and a fun experience! The servers were all really accommodating to us hot pot newbies and explained the whole process. Definitely a place I'll go back to!
13805,"Good stuff, Maynard!"
13806,We had gone in for cheesecake but they were out so the next day we went they remembered  us and we got the cheesecake and carrot cake  to go would  have loved to sit have coffee such  a quaint place
13807,Best selection in the valley.
13808,"I love Leroy's. One star deduction for variety, but I do appreciate a diner that offers options to fries. Everything prepared to order, one of the only 24 hour restaurants in Anchorage. Great burgers and breakfast."
13809,Lacks good customer service in lieu of low prices
13810,Always a delight
13811,My favorite smoke shop by far.. I wont go anywhere else in anchorage for.my smokes and accessories
13812,Always a good selection but this year Christmas dollars did not go as far as years past. Price's are almost 10-15% higher than last year on items like sleep wear and essentials.
13813,I rented a camera and lens for my vacation. Very helpful people throughout the process.
13814,Large dinning hall.plenty of room for social distance donning.
13815,"I was a little worried when we walked in, as there was no one else there when we arrived. The staff was friendly, the decor was very well done, beautiful and clean with simple table settings and dark wood. The menu, although limited, was delicious! One of the specials was a New York strip with veggies & garlic mashed potatoes and it was by far the best steak I have ever had. I asked for medium and it was perfect! I asked to sub the garlic mashed potatoes for double veggies and they had no issue with it. My husband, son, and daughter all had burgers and we're very pleased with them. Great choice in mixed beverages, as well as local beer & wine. The prices were a bit high but I would still recommend as the service was great and the food delicious."
13816,This is my favorite place to hike
13817,"Woman working here (forgot her name) helped me on the phone before I headed over. Answered all my questions and was so kind and explained so well. Went in and picked up what I needed and was because the deals are amazing I was able to get another accessory I needed for collection. There's a points system too. They have a huge selection of glass this, that, and the other thing. If you need something ""heady"" and you can't find it anywhere else, they more than likely have it. I walked in and I was instantly like 😲😍 all the glass pieces in there. Highly recommend 10/10👽💚"
13818,"So, H2oasis was definitely super cool when it first opened over a decade ago, and my kids still absolutely love coming here. I just feel that they charge a lot, yet the place is starting to run down a little. Not sure what it would take to get some fresh paint or something. I do appreciate though that you can be there practically all day, so if you do, you get your money's worth."
13819,Great
13820,Great food for one price
13821,They exceeded my expectations.   Would bring my cars to them again.
13822,Lots of army boys. Not a safe place to drink
13823,So much fun for the whole family. It's a better deal to get the membership.
13824,I love Taco Bell
13825,Great food! Large portions! Awesome staff! Palmer Landmark
13826,A nice place to go in and courage to relax and just regroup.
13827,"Jill was great with our Charlie. He looks and smells great. His coat is soft, fluffy, and he is happy.
Happy dog=happy dog owner
We will be back :)"
13828,Best modern Japanese food on the East side

13831,Great hike!  So beautiful!
13832,Always the perfect cut.
13833,"Typically decent, nothing special, but good as can be expected for a fast food place."
13834,Great visit. You need a lot of time to experience everything.
13835,Good snacks great movies.
13836,The people who work there are great.  The people who hang out outside is the only downfall to this store.
13837,Delicious pizza. The crust is fabulous! Family friendly. Great service.
13838,"Always great service that takes care of my 2 dogs.  One very large and one medium, both don't like to get washed, but the ladies always make it happen.  I highly recommend."
13839,My puppy loves the toys.they have lots.
13840,Foot was amazing I definitely will be stopping there  every time I go to homer I recommend
13841,Fletchers is a great spot to grab higher end pub food. The gnocchi was fantastic!
13842,"The restaurant can be pretty reasonable, and provides one of the nicer dine-in environments in Barrow."
13843,Best place on earth!!
13844,Got in and out quickly with 35 breakfast burritos for work and everyone said they tasted great too.
13845,Looking for dvds
13846,Great food and awesome service and server. Bob is awesome
13847,Expensive!
13848,"Fantastic place to eat, food is delicious and portions are really good sized.  They brew some really special beers to taste, so you have a good list to choose from on the menu.  The your servers are super friendly & quick.  If you go and want a great views ask for the 3rd floor deck seating, you'll get great views of Cook's Inlet, the surrounding mountains ranges and if you're really lucky you just may get to see Denali.  We had a very nice time there and so will you."
13849,Good Selection Friendly Service
13850,It was okay. But I would not have missed much if I had missed this one.
13851,Service & food is great! Very Keen to customer needs & wants.

13853,Yummy!!
13854,Very good!!
13855,"Curbside pickup, excellent communication and was able to get an item shipped from another location in a decent time frame!"
13856,"If you can look past the rusty corroded metal railings, you can have a lot of fun on the body slide, master blaster double tube ride, and lazy river featuring waterfalls in multiple spots. This place is very safety conscious with life guards in all the major areas. Great for ages 2+"
13857,Great sweets!
13858,The Food was delicious and the Drinks okay... They've also got a nice friendly Staff over there. ALso Many TV's to watch throughout the Roadhouse & they've also got a nice small bar over there as well! Overall Texas Roadhouse is a very nice place to go out and eat highly recommend...
13859,Good outfit good.meal
13860,Awesome access to see animals.  This is a private entity and they do a great job
13861,"Don't go here go to AutoZone, way better service and knowledgeable at Auto zone"
13862,"Never open when google or their posted time on the door says they should be open. We keep trying to get in to get some things taken care of, but every time we come (when they’re supposed to be open) doors are locked and they are closed."
13863,"Knowledgeable and happy to help.  A tremendous selection of products for all of your fermenting endeavors.  Also, generous contributors to the local homebrewing community."
13864,Food was good had a few issues orders showed up with items that where asked to have removed fries where very small portions and wife had French toast show up with avocado residue on it like they cut and avocado then the toast with same knife.. all items where fixed apon request. All in all 4 of 5 isn't bad
13865,Has lettuce wrap options for any burger which is amazing. I wish every burger joint had a lettuce wrap
13866,The associates are first rate.  Very helpful and a wonderful fabric selection.
13867,Great Alaskan experience!
13868,Someone is always willing to help and even knew what I was talking about even when I didn't.  🙄 They are always great there.
13869,We LOVE the dog park area! Not a lot of wind as its semi protected by being in a valley. We always meet the nicest doggos here. Very clean area. Much improved over the past few years.
13870,Delicious donuts and amazing service. Didn't realized they had closed and called 15 min after. Drove across town to pick up some donuts for a meeting and they still allowed me to pick up my donuts and were very cheerful and friendly about it. Whenever I'm able I'll get their donuts over Carrs or Fred Meyers.
13871,"The food was good. Nice for small parties of less than 4, but I don't reccomend larger as it's so busy. They do take reservations for larger groups. If you come to Alaska it is a must at least once."
13872,Great Soup and Sandwich
13873,"Service and entertainment tops. Ribs and other fixings good, but salmon was dry or maybe over cooked.  Give them a shot, the actors/singers really have some talent, in some cases as good as broadway."
13874,Nice old time clothing store feel great place to find cathart work clothes with wide variety and easy sales help no pressure &friendly. They also carry Filson outdoor clothing their a well known favorite for hunters as 1 of the oldest water 💧 proof wear and durability.
13875,We like coming here.
13876,"Wasn't very crowded which was nice, but feel like that's because the lanes aren't very nice. Anytime you needed something you needed to walk to the counter because the person working was on his phone the whole time. May be OK without kids, but with little kids we needed to go to the counter 4-5 times for help."
13877,The Mendenhall Glacier and Nugget Falls Excursion was a wonderful experience. It's amazing seeing the glacier closely. A short walk from the Visitors Center brings you up to Nugget Falls. There's also a stunning view looking the opposite way of the Falls! Nature at it's finest
13878,"Fair selection, freshness is a hit or miss."
13879,Nate in the service department has been great to deal with during my past couple visits to Chrysler Dodge.  I will definitely be a return customer!
13880,Helpful advice and tips for any project.
13881,Small but beautiful garden. Lovingly maintained. A gem!
13882,"The food is great, and the staff is always friendly. They need to bring back the 7 layer chocolate cake."
13883,Great food and even better service!
13884,Great people that look out for loyal customers
13885,Life guards be nice to people that come use pool area think abut what say to people becuse my feeling got hurt ....
13886,"Great service, great beer, great food and of course, the Magic Bus!"
13887,Love the atmosphere!  Employees are super nice and our food was delicious.  I had the meatloaf sandwich which tasted great the only suggestion I'd have is to have it on a thicker bread.
13888,Favorite place in the world
13889,Nice selection of road snacks
13890,Very knowledgeable
13891,Great food! And fast
13892,I loved this little aquarium.  For it's size they have nice habits for the animals.  I loved the aviary the birds were free to fly around and you were in with them.  Saw a rescued baby walrus they were trying to teach how to get in and out of the water.  Cutest baby ever.
13893,Watch for broken glass! Best beach in town!
13894,Fantastic place to stay! The room was large and well appointed. I would reccomend this place for everyone!
13895,how can you not love this place
13896,lots of fun.  it has history you can touch  making it much more fun and accessible for little ones.  The earthquake (of 64) exhibit is presented in a neat way.
13897,Good food
13898,"They had horchata and melon juice, which was amazing, I didn't enjoy their white cheese sauce though, it had the Velveeta mouth feel for a finish."
13899,"Good food and good customer service, I always get the two enchiladas with rice and beans meal, it is very filling and tastes great"
13900,"very clean place, food was very tasty and good staff."
13901,Great food
13902,"Need rubber boots, fishing gear or fittings it's a great place but clothing prices are too high."
13903,Good service
13904,"Bell’s has a gorgeous selection of gifts, plants, seasonal decorations, and dishes. It has such a pleasant atmosphere, especially around the holidays. I’ve bought several trees here and the staff are knowledgeable and pleasant. The coffee shop is very pleasant as well and has flowers on all the tables. If you’re ever having a dreary day, Bell’s will cheer you up!"
13905,A bit costly...but how else would you get to whittier? They are always on time for traffic releases and the staff is friendly. Clean public bathrooms are available.
13906,"What a warm and welcoming church.  There are spectacular wood carvings hanging in front and the back of the church wall, that we're hand carved and finished, by one of the parishioners.  The end of the Mass was particularly heart warming, when the visitors (like us), people celebrating birthdays and the like, were invited to the front of the congregation, who then sang a beautiful prayer for our safe journey and any special occasion that anyone had. Really touched our 💓, thank you."
13907,Well this place didn't last long. Going too big too soon Casey. Putting any of your products on craigslist to compensate your loss?
13908,Fast drive-thru. And people.!
13909,No complaints. Good service. Wish our Costco in Canada too visa as the one here does. More food choices at food court than Canada. Better prices as well even with exchange.
13910,This is the place to go for donuts in town.
13911,Its just McDonald's
13912,Great place to take the family 👪 for a day out
13913,"My fettuccini Alfredo tasted fantastic, originally $13.  I then added mushrooms $3 as listed on the menu.  I inquired about adding shrimp. She said they can do it but didn’t let me know what the price was. I expected it wouldn’t be that expensive. Was I surprised!  The up charge was $12. (That’s $3 a shrimp for 4 of them).  Absurd.
From the start there was no silverware she forgot that request, actually we had to get up and get it ourself.  She kept forgetting things.  Each time she ran back to get something it took several minutes. It appeared that she was serving another table before grabbing an item she forgot.  The clean and nice. Just not sure why serving us was so difficult. It wasn’t that busy on a Sunday night. We only had a side salad, the fettuccine, a hot chocolate and a dessert."
13914,Delicious pizza and many gluten free options. 👍
13915,Great place to  shop    and people are kind
13916,I like it but during the winter enerting to get your car vacuumed there is a big pot hole from the ice that needs to get fixed because I didnt even know that there was a pot hole and I went right through that and caused a leak under my car and dented my passenger door from the bottom. I notify the workers before I left I hope they fixed it.
13917,"Beautiful Lake filled with salmon during part of the year. Nice 5 mile walk around the lake. Great for camping, kayaking and picnicking. Sadly, summer 2019 the camping area was closed due to falling trees. Hopefully it will open again next summer. One of my favorite spots that’s not too crowded with tourists in the summer. More of a locals place."
13918,Best place for late dinner for busy people
13919,"Fantastic pizza, a little over priced and takes a while to get but well worth the wait"
13920,They are there for people in need!
13921,I've taken my animals to all of the vets here and they are just the best.
13922,Just great ice cream! Wouldn't really eat burgers here again mainly dessert.
13923,Very family and wonderful customer service
13924,I ordered chicken stir fry with veggies and white rice. Got  four fried chicken wings on a stick on top of a small slice of bread. And the lady there spoke good English
13925,"Very busy on this holiday weekend. Well maintained, wide trail with wooden stairs in the steepest places. Only one bad rocky, slick spot. Great views from top."
13926,Quick food for lunch. Staff not always as helpful As could be.
13927,Got married here!  Fantastic building rental and beautiful lake.  The perfect spot!
13928,Home
13929,"Great pizza, great beer. Usually a line, but always worth it!"
13930,Upper class Walmart in red
13931,Love it
13932,A little bit dirty and unorganized.
13933,Cant get enough of this place
13934,Awsome place to eat great food!
13935,Pricey but good
13936,"The worst fast food I have ever had! I had some hot wings delivered to me last night I took 3 bites and threw the rest away, this food tasted like the oil that was used was several months old! I am very disappointed, a waste of my hard earned money! $38.00 down the drain. I will never eat there again!!!"
13937,"A throwback to a simpler time. One of the last true ""roadhouse"" type joints in Alaska. I saw several plates come out while I was waiting, and all the dishes looked hearty and well put together. I stuck with a classic diner bacon cheeseburger, and it was spot on. Griddle fried bun, lots of melty cheese, and nice thick bacon on top of a 1/3 lb beef patty. The pies are legendary, and if I hadn't had another 200 miles to go, I would have indulged. Great food in a picturesque locale."
13938,"Waitress was a little aloof but drinks were cold, food was good."
13939,"If you need paint, go see Wendy at South Lowe's. She can make any color and service is always a 10!"
13940,"This is place is right behind the hotel that I'm staying at. Figured why not give it a shot? Took 30 mins to get my hot dog and chili fries.

The hot dog was ok, but for $5 I was expecting a bigger hot dog. The chili fries were made with generic Sysco (food service) crinkle fries and the chili was canned Hormel-quality chili. At least use Wolf Chili without beans, goddamnit. Don't know why it took so long to make my order, I was the only customer at the time. The poor girl who worked there was nice enough, but she had that look in her eyes like her soul was dead.

Overall, 2.5 stars"
13941,Efficient and courteous service.  Nice to have a GCI store so close!
13942,"Friendly staff. Hours of operation are fewer than  two of the three other auto parts stores in Eagle River. This store tends to have the parts I need, when I need them, for all four of my vehicles.

There is also a significant discount coupon available (for many years) on the back side of the nearby Fred Meyer receipts (25% off as of this review)"
13943,"Dirty sticky menu's, poor service ."
13944,"As a long time resident of Fairbanks, I love this bar."
13945,Fantastic authentic Mexican food!
13946,Excellent food. Nice people.
13947,"Great bar, consistently good food, great staff.  Owners truly know the meaning of hospitality."
13948,Groceries and Sundries
13949,Good service
13950,"Very accessible, good rates."
13951,Great breakfast for a reasonable price.
13952,One of my favorite places to eat!!!
13953,Great food!
13954,"We got there close to 11 am. One girl was on her lunch as she was sitting down eating, another girl looked as if she was stoned or just woke up & the 3rd  girl seemed ok. The girl that was on lunch whom seemed to be in charge of the other two, returned to work with food in her mouth. Mouth was stuffed full you could see her food, hair was a lil messy & she was wearing flip flops...she did have socks on, thankfully. The food was fine other then we had the same kind of bread but it looked a lot different. His was nice & golden my pretty dark but the taste was fine."
13955,Amazing life story of salmon
13956,"Haven't been to every dispensary but this is by far my favorite one. Not only do they have great smoking and edible options, but they also have awesome merch and salesmen"
13957,Hassle free guidance rendered to the tourists.
13958,This particular location has some the most careless food service staff in the world.  There are some items on the menu I like on occasion and have gotten them about 2 of 3 trips.  I will avoid this store and go to Dimond Center if I am craving a breakfast sandwich or Whopper.
13959,"Here's an edit after an amazing response from management which made me stop and rethink.

I'd complained I didn't like the lack of a lift to take baggage upstairs. The lack of air con. And the disastrous bath design.

The response was to say they'd strip out the baths. Rethink aircon and reconsider luggage. I'm impressed. A management that responds like this is one I'd support, I regret not meeting them when I was there.

Still no safe in the room.

I raise it to 3star.  Gracious of me I know. But thank hotel management for taking suggestions seriously and in good humour.

If you have issues, address them with these guys on site. A rarety is a management that listens. Cheers"
13960,"Great price for a pick up order, the girl at the counter was kind, courtious and funny. And the pie was great, so we're the wings, they just melt in your mouth. Overall great experience. Good job. The place was clean and we'll lit,  the pizza stations are in fast pace and well thought-out, very nice place."
13961,Truly really great phillies!  Wide assortment and combinations.  Great kids menu also.  The most surprising part is the roll the Phillies are on.  They are toasted to perfection and so soft and delicious. I highly recommend the restaurant.
13962,"Well its a Wal-Mart, and wal-marts are well wal-marts. SHOP LOCAL WHEN YOU CAN.
Paying a few bucks more will support your local economy."
13963,"I love this place. I love the cheese and gallery that they are inside. The staff is really helpful and knowledgeable on pairing and quality to suit your individual tastes. I wanted to rate them 1 Star despite how much I love this place and used to eat there frequently. The owner ruined the experience. I called at 11:30am to ask her if she would be interested in collaborating with my employers wine tasting by providing great pairings. She was abrupt when I couldn't speak fast enough for her. She stated I am in my lunch run now so call back. And, hung up on me. I will not be back nor use her business for this great opportunity to get her product out on larger scale. Pretty sad because I miss the great cheese."
13964,Fabulous
13965,Super expensive with sub-par menu offerings
13966,Took great care of me and my vehicle
13967,This is the place to come for all of the Seahawk games!!  They are great!
13968,Very helpful and courteous.
13969,All we needed for an overnight
13970,Awesome selection of beer and food
13971,Best pizza in Ketchikan!
13972,"Great soups, breakfast sandwiches, and burgers. Their customer service and price isn't always great though."
13973,Great service with a smile! I like there frappicinios!
13974,Good spot good work. Honest.
13975,Hmm lamb and eggants.
13976,"If you're looking for newer and cleaner fuel pumps then you need to visit this Fred Meyer Fuel Center.  These pumps look brand new and all the buttons work; how often do you find this to be true in Anchorage?  The location is great because I'm not dodging shopping carts and crazy parking lot traffic.  I think you'll enjoy stopping here for your gasoline.

13977,Great place to stay.  Even if you are just camping.
13978,The old gray haired gentleman employee us a ride as hell. Shouldn't be in customer service.
13979,Great food and descent pricing I have found my new spot for pho on Muldoon!!!
13980,"Simply amazing. I LOVE the attention and time they take with each item they prepare for you. Nothing here is boring. The menu is to die for, even if you’re not the adventurous type, you will be so happy you tried something new! I haven’t been disappointed with one little thing here. The atmosphere is cozy yet happy. You feel
Like they’ve known you forever when you walk thru the door. It’s worth every penny you spend and a date would be impressed with the experience - as it isn’t “just a meal”. Good wine to top it off. I’m getting  hungry thinking about it! Yum!"
13981,"Beautiful!  Whales, puffins, glaciers, seals, eagles."
13982,"Always tasty, clean, sushi."
13983,Great easy access hiking area
13984,Various activities and recommendations for adventuring Homer and surrounding areas
13985,We were referred to this place as we wanted to get away from the touristy places.  It did not disappoint.  Nice little local joint that serves the best fried haddock that I have ever tasted.
13986,We went here to just have drinks and wait for our husbands to come back from a fishing trip. The host was kinda rude and didn't seem happy that we were there another lady brought us water and never said a word or smiled. We were starting to regret our pick for our wait. Luckily our waitress Jennie made up for the horrible intro to the restaurant. Jennie came to our table with a warm smile and a very pleasant and helpful attitude 😊. We each had a couple of drinks and my niece had a Shirley Temple. The food sounded amazing but we didn't try any.
13987,Fast food
13988,Great store!
13989,Quick and easy and inexpensive!
13990,"The gals were extremely friendly and helpful to myself, my mom, and my sister who all individually needed help with different things. They were outspoken and were glad to hood a conversation and helped us find the exact products that would work best for us. Price on alot of items aren't bad but we careful cause it adds up fast. 😂"
13991,"If you like buttery and cheesy food, this is the place to go!"
13992,Food was pretty basic
13993,Great
13994,"Excellent food, great staff and amazing prices. First time here and loved it."
13995,No comment
13996,Great place friendly an help nice cars clean an great gas mileage
13997,"CASH ONLY! (They do have an ATM on site.) I used the shower facilities only, but it was a great experience. The staff was super friendly, the showers we're clean, and it was super easy. A little pricey at almost $6, but still worth the money. I will use them again. They appear to have excellent laundry facilities as well."
13998,I admire the work that they do here they saved many marine animals it's fun to go and see all their displays great for kids and adults We joined in their membership program
13999,"Great choice if you're looking for robust,a fordable gear."
14000,Beautiful
14001,Good food and great service in north pole.
14002,Food was hot and fresh. Employees were very nice.
14003,Store is looking a little old.  Needs a good cleaning
14004,Best bar food in town ❤️
14005,Little out dated
14006,"Good place for outside recreation, just needs rent a cans or bathroom facilities"
14007,Love it! Great food! Great prices! Great staff! They make you feel like family!
14008,"I got really lost in there trying to find a friend's place. There's street signs, but none that are registered with Google Maps."
14009,Who ever came up with this place was on spot for what Military Families need in AK. I can get on the elliptical machine and my kids are right there next to me on the indoor park.  It's was much cleaner than the fast food indoor parks I've been to as well.
14010,"Excellent, excellent tour company. Great pilot gave us a circle flight at the Dawson Hwy bridge over the Yukon River, then Rachel, our van tour guide was outstanding in her knowledge and driving ability as she drove us back to Fairbanks from Coldfoot. All the stops, the meals and scenery were perfect."
14011,Nice selection but a little over priced
14012,The bread for the dips are fantastic. The au jus is the best best I've ever had
14013,Hard to get but I like my bacon CRISPY
14014,They sell kimchi!!!
14015,"It was great. After hiking the trails, I stayed to have lunch at the restaurant and to relax at the hotsprings."
14016,"It's taco Bell, give me something to work with Dad you guys do have tacos and nachos and burritos Arby's still has really good jalapenos why why don't you guys"
14017,"Awesome place! Cool toys and amazing selection of board games. 40k is here too, if that's what you are into."
14018,"Our accommodation was in a small cabin with restroom, nicely decorated and fairly inexpensive. However, the cabin was located directly next to the highway and with the branches of trees scraping the roof and walls was very noisy all night. Overall was a good experience."
14019,I always appreciate the law enforcement discount! Most places around here don't do that!
14020,"(Translated by Google) Ehh!

(Original)
Ehh!"
14021,"Generally decent selection of groceries, about what you'd expect from a Safeway store.  The 'natural' section could be enhanced... Natural Pantry is a better option if this is important."
14022,Good place to take a break.  There is WiFi.
14023,"(Translated by Google) Best coffee in the area who comes from Europe! No filter coffee or other Ami puddle. You own a real coffee machine! Prices are very good! Very nice service!

(Original)
Bester Kaffe in der Umgebung wen man aus Europa kommt! Kein Filter Kaffe oder sonstige Ami Pfütze. Sie besitzen eine richtige Kaffe Maschine! Preise sind sehr Gut! Sehr nette Bedienung!"
14024,great for rc
14025,A great place for those of us who hate going to wal-mart!
14026,Food court pizza is a must have!
14027,Views were nice but way too expensive.
14028,Different. Don't bring toddlers- too many safety issues. Not a handicap friendly location. More for able bodied adults.
14029,"Love, love love this place.  Every time we visit Anchorage this restaurant is a must!  The food is fresh, tasty and presentation artful.
Caesar salad had an asian twist and the beef curry was pleasingly spicy but not over done."
14030,Went in to Arctic Ammo to pick up a firearm transfer from buds. Great family atmosphere and the paperwork was completed quickly.
14031,Had an emergency lock situation on truck topper. The lady at the front counter was extremely helpful and took care of the problem in no time. Was in a hurry and didn't get a chance to thank her. Much appreciated.
14032,Great family restaurant and to top it off they have dole whip!
14033,"The sushi was great. It was packed but we got our food in a decent amount of time. The servers were on top of it.

The best part is that there were a lot of gluten free options for the sushi and main deal.

The bathroom was clean."
14034,Once again at Sheraton in Anchorage.  Still the best place to stay.
14035,"Great store, they have different types of souvenirs and the prices are a good call."
14036,"Two lessons in and I want more. I can’t decide which was more fun, working on the bouldering walls or belaying. A great deal of thought and technique are used in this sport, so the time passed so quickly. I can see how people who take climbing up as a hobby end up working at gyms like this, it would be easy to spend the day wanting to push yourself further. My instructors, Spencer and Jeff, were both excellent (and patiently endured my complete lack of experience). Membership at the gym isn’t required for introductory courses, so anyone can give it a try without making a huge commitment. If you do decide to join, they also have a full gym that is available for use. There are great deals for families and they have an option, for a very nominal fee, to allow your membership to go dormant if you snowbird or just want to slack for awhile. If your a beginner, like me, just come with the attitude that kids shorter than your knee will surpass you from the start...humbling and endearing all at once!

Update: The Adult/Child Frigid Flash Competition & the The 24th Annual Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival presented by Arc’teryx are both going on right now...check out their website for information."
14037,Great program
14038,Toyotas and subarus best in town.
14039,"The Kobuk is a little of everything that is great about Alaska: rustic, historic, friendly, charming, fragrant, delicious, and just a little Russian. Drop in and try their signature Samovar tea. It's too intense for more than a sip, but it's a great sip. Shop for European chocolate or handcrafted Alaskan swag. The real treasure is the cafe in the back. Artisan tea, homemade donuts, great Italian soda, and more. Sit by the fire or, if it's warm out, enjoy the patio. You really can't go wrong. Its the least tourist-y gift shop in downtown."
14040,"Almost the same as the gas station, only restaurant orientated, and more self serve"
14041,Lettuce was a bit brown this last time. Love the salads usually because they are usually very fresh. Was not the case. I hope they fix that.
14042,Jesse was our server and was on the spot with our needs. It was quiet and clean. Had a very nice dinner with my wife
14043,my favorite place
14044,"A caring group of physicians . Dr. Moll is the best ever, a doctor who does everything. He's a great diagnostician.   I also really like Jason Hedberg,  the PA for the practice.  So pleased I lucked into Dr. Moll when I first moved to Anchorage and Jason takes great care of me when Dr. Moll has a day off. They never minimize  always seek the correct diagnosis and treatment."
14045,Good place to buy things for fixing and maintaining a boat.
14046,Staff has always been friendly and helpful to me
14047,My wife and I had a great time! They have a reasonably priced food and drink menu.
14048,interesting
14049,"CASH ONLY! (They do have an ATM on site.) I used the shower facilities only, but it was a great experience. The staff was super friendly, the showers we're clean, and it was super easy. A little pricey at almost $6, but still worth the money. I will use them again. They appear to have excellent laundry facilities as well."
14050,first the place is packed!! the food and service are top notch!! a little pricey but you can find a bargain. but honestly let's be real it's worth every penny.
14051,I use to work at a Subway in Texas and yet every time I smell the fresh baked bread I just want to eat.
14052,Great
14053,Halibut and Chips and the Fish tacos are great. Quick service and a nice view from the restaurant.
14054,I enjoy both Japanese and Hawaiian food and they do it very well. I also like coming here for shaved ice.
14055,Thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. The portions were large enough I couldn't finish it but there's never a complaint from me about that!
14056,Very cool place. Lots to see.
14057,Pretty good service for fast food. Good covid mitigation in place. Other than that... it's 🌮 🔔.
14058,Offers good selection
14059,Mmmmmm sorry I'm too busy eating their wonderful foood
14060,"If you're looking for something, Troy will help you find it."
14061,"This location is on par with most of the others I've visited. The restroom was ok. The wait in the drive thru was a little long, but the FF were nice and hot! 😀"
14062,"Really amazing park. The ranger was very kind and helpful, gave us many tips to enjoy our visit"
14063,"Just so you know getting a five-star review for me is very difficult. So if you've earned a four-star review count yourself lucky. The wait staff was super friendly and attentive. He answered all of my questions happily. He recommended an appetizer that was off the charts delicious! Highly recommend the tostaditos! Super delicious and huge! I also got the Tijuana taco which was pretty good but stuffed so full and so sloppy I couldn't eat it like a taco and had to eat it with a fork. I also ordered the fajita supreme with both steak and chicken. It was pretty delicious came out sizzling and amazing only thing is they forgot the mushrooms which was the reason why I got the supreme in the first place. However I didn't realize they forgot mushrooms until we were boxing things up to go. I'm sure they would have made it right if I would have said something.
I did specify the ranchero beans versus the refried beans for the fajitas and they came out refried. But that's not a deal-breaker. I've been to gallos A few times before and they make excellent margaritas too. not this trip but on a previous trip I ordered the taquitos and they gave me the flautas instead only problem with this is that I'm allergic to gluten so I was not able to eat that. They tried to make it right and sent out another plate of flautas 😂"
14064,Not impressed anymore
14065,Have been going to Koots since I turned 21!
14066,Quick and easy place to pump gas! Convenient location!
14067,Love the atmosphere and the food is great. Definite must for place to eat.
14068,"Small portions, its ok but expensive. I guess not bad for airport food. Meat kinda tastes old too."
14069,Bradley did an excellent job in showing and sharing why the rotors needed replacing.  My parents appreciated Kendall being able to work the vehicle in before a 4 hour trip home.
14070,Very nice since the remodel. Staff is very friendly and let me order even though it was technically a minute past closing time.
14071,Its ok
14072,Good neighborhood bar
14073,Flavor blast is awesome
14074,"We had a great time at Garcia's Cantina & Cafe. The food was good - I loved the Fajitas, and while I wasn't as huge on the pollo fundido, my wife loved it, so I'm chalking that one up to personal tastes. The atmosphere was very upbeat/lively, and lighting to match, and service was great. We were very surprised by how fast our food came out, and the employees were a lot of fun."
14075,Great food!
14076,"Pleasant people with great options for games too! Pool, darts and bowling!"
14077,You Re taken into the world gold mining.  Great.
14078,One of my favorite restaurants in Soldotna. The food is fairly priced and delicious!
14079,Great inventory and nice people. Great place to shop.....
14080,Don't miss it
14081,"Love the fish and chips, ate here 3 times in a weekend!"
14082,I stopped in for a pedicure and I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else now. Thuy (Twee) went above and beyond. I have never had such a thorough pedicure done before. I got a lavender jelly pedicure with french tips and she removed callouses from my feet that have been there for years. My legs are tingling an hour later and I feel so refreshed. I am definitely going to be a routine customer!
14083,Yummy
14084,"Good brunch and drinks,  will be back"
14085,Best view to enjoy while you are in Anchorage. A must see spot while visiting Anchorage. Getting there can be a little tricky.

14095,Always a favorite where we take visitors.
14096,A large selection of beautiful home furniture and decor makes this place invaluable for someone looking for furnishing their home or apartment. However the general layout and salespeople make a trip here confusing and a tad frustrating.
14097,Kinda spendy for what you get.
14098,The beer is cold  and its not over priced.
14099,Great place for the sportsman
14100,Not very good pizza and the menu or pizza items never change

14114,"This place is legit. Smells fishy inside but the food is awesome. Best bulgogi in town. Fried rice is great. They usually only have one waitress so yea..but, great food."
14115,Loved the ride!
14116,"I haven't even had the luxury of going here yet. I read on some reviews and thought may I will give it a shot. I called them around 2pm and the lady that answered the phone was already rude. No thank you for calling, no hi how are you, none of that. She answered the phone and I said hello how are you she said busy. I said well saying that you guys won't be able to get me done today huh? She said nope. I said can I make an appointment for tomorrow, she said be here by 10mm and we may get you in. They don't open till noon. Horrible customer service right off the bat. Only leads me to believe the service is not so great either."
14117,Most bang for your buck. And delicious

14136,"Very good selection, esp. when it comes to GF beers, lots more variety then any place else."
14137,"Horrible manager ... Very rude ... Wouldn't allow me and my girlfriend to sit outside because the porch is an ""extension of the bar"" meanwhile there is little kids running around everywhere ..... She continued to chew out her staff for not immediately checking our IDs as soon as we walked through the door.... They won't even serve me a beer because my woman isn't 21 yet .... How the heck am i not allowed to drink a beer at dinner because she isnt 21 yet ... Won't come back ... Server was nice"
14138,Lots of international food items
14139,"Not bad prices, hate the parking lot and overcrowded feeling of the place personally."
14140,Sadly rain had covered snow making it icy and we were unable to walk the trail.
14141,It really is great pizza for this style of hot and ready.  Really nice service staff at this location too.  Refreshing to be treated professionally at a take out pizza place.
14142,Did not know this was part of the Best Western...super cute but simple.  Food was delicious and pricing was fair
14143,The chef did excellent job. Liked the ground pepper joke..

14159,"good food and good service even though very busy, courteous service and even though it was busy(real busy) our wait wasn't long at all."
14160,"Burgers were great as always, but $12 for a side salad made out of leaf lettuce is a little disappointing.  I now know."
14161,They did a wounderful job ! Thank you
14162,Fun local place. Lots of options. Sushi was good.  Would return.
14163,Slow service in the restaurant but there are lots of fun games for the kids.

14176,The Al Pastor tacos are legit. Eat here.
14177,Loved it! There are so many cool cars from a time of forgotten auto history! This is a must see during a visit to Fairbanks.
14178,Lots of food for good price
14179,Not sure if I just love of mall or I just love shopping! 🤣
14180,Great food!
14181,"This place has A LOT of everything.  If you need it, they probably have it.  I think it's a great place for Alaska visitors to get clothing and equipment for their Alaska adventures that they don't use or want at home.  You can buy a rain coat, a warm coat, a warm hat, sleeping bags, clam shovels, treking poles, even fishing rods (if you know what you're looking for) and use them for your vacation and return them to the Bargain Basement when you leave.  They don't really buy most used stuff but they would take it off your hands. The prices are fair and the shopping trip is an entertaining diversion on a rainy day."
14182,Good
14183,"Everyone was super nice, the staff is professional, and I got a great referral from here. I had a particularly hard case that I feel like could have been stopped early. It felt like they took on the case and didn't know when to quit, which is great, but the job didn't get done here in the long run. Follow ups were great. Dr. Ohsie and Dr. Abosede were both really good."
14184,Great
14185,"We got our food to go and it traveled well. The lemon cookie was a bit disappointing, not much lemon flavor. But all of the savory dishes were great. We ordered an Italian beef, gravy on the side, a chicken sandwich with bacon (very generous with the bacon), and an order of chili fries. The service was very quick and extraordinarily friendly."
14186,Did not honor reservation.
14187,Had a GREAT time . I would go again in a heartbeat
14188,Lots of room for dogs. It's also fenced
14189,Always nicr
14190,They were fast and decently priced!
14191,This particular Walmart supercenter has great customer service. I needed to do a return and the process was so easy even though I lost my receipt. Awesome service!
14192,Great texmex
14193,"Some good deals, shop your sales."
14194,Very good food
14195,The staff in the body shop office were extremely friendly and very professional. I was kept up-to-date on the progress of my vehicle and it was done in a very timely manner.
14196,"Honestly, I hate being so much. BUT.  First time I went here for an audio harness/connector kit for an Explorer.   They didn't try very hard to find the guy who knew what I was talking about and left me there alone trying to figure it out myself.   I left crying soooooo frustrated.   I learned I could hard wire it and got some knowledge in the end.  The second time I went guy showing me laptops said ""I'll be right back!"" I looked around for 20 minutes and he was talking to someone else so I found me another guy.  He said there were no laptops that had 365 already installed so I went and got the label out of the display and showed him.  And asked again how well it preformed because it wasn't a Call brand.  More a Well.  If you get my reference."
14197,Nice park by the library
14198,Great store for outdoor gear!
14199,Love this place. Great bread and great sandwhiches
14200,"This is a great hike! The trail to get to the glacier isn’t bad at all and I’ve seen folks in all different physical conditions make it there (it’s about 50 minutes round-trip). There’s a wheelchair accessible portion of the trail that gets you to a viewpoint of the glacier, which I believe is one of the few in the Seward area. The drive in to get to the trailhead is beautiful and there are signs on the drive and on the trail showing years indicating where the glacier was at that particular year. The trail breaks off into the Harding Icefield Trail, which is a bit of a doozy. It’s on our “to-do” list, but just making it to Marmot Meadows (Stop 1 of 3 on that trail) was pretty exhausting. Rangers walk up to that point and do guides tours as well, which is nice.  Definitely worth checking out if you’re in the area!

Note: The road into the park is closed to cars during the winter. You could walk on the road, but it’s too long of a journey on foot unless you just want to get to the first pull-out/viewing area."
14201,Nice  place
14202,Was ok long wait (we didn't have reservations) food is good prices are a little steep. Overall good.
14203,Worth the trip.  Take some time to explore tide pools and the surrounding forest.
14204,Great fun space for kids
14205,"Friendly staff, clean establishment!  The food is tasty and get a lot of food for your buck."
14206,"This is one of our favorite dispensaries.  They have great deals, and all the ladies there are super friendly and very knowledgeable."
14207,"Edit: Horrible customer service too, dealing with them through emails is horrible. I hope you never have a problem with your order and have to deal with Corporate, they just dont care about customers, even the local Hardrock management.

Wasn't my favorite. Asked for no Tomatoes in the nachos and the beans that we're on it included tomatoes. Informed the waiter he might want to know that. Grilled chicken on the nachos we're ice cold not sure if that is normal?? Wasn't very appealing at all, burnt chips, cold chicken horrible flavor."
14208,always helpful and friendly
14209,Love shopping here. Great varieties and the staff is super friendly and helpful
14210,I love watching the plane lights on the water at night
14211,Always friendly and have what your looking for
14212,Amazing customer service. Food was amazing and soo delicious. Try the plum wine also if you ever stop here.
14213,"This has to be the very best place ""EVER"" that Robert & I have had breakfast! Delicious Home Cooking! You feel like you are sitting at your Grandparents kitchen table!"
14214,Better than Walmart
14215,Great food friendly staff clean and fast
14216,Always an amazing time!!!  Love this place!!!
14217,Plenty of options and a helpful staff. It helps to use the home depot app ahead of time to ensure the product is in stock. Most local stores have the app and it's a great idea to save time and money to install it today.
14218,If we need something in the Cooper landing area this is the stop
14219,This is ok as in average as most shopping centers are.
14220,Suzy is so amazing and is the nicest person you could ever meet. Great prices and convenient location.
14221,Best self service carwash in anchorage.
14222,I love it
14223,"The actual Service and answering questions were good but the organization was poor. Between my appointment time and the time I was seen, the clinic was over two hours late. Telemedicine Was a nice option but it was unclear how that was going to work."
14224,"RUDE. I called to check on an estimate after waiting for awhile because they hadn't given one the first time I called. The woman snapped at me that the driver was in the area and when I asked if I could have an actual estimate in mintues she yelled  ""I DON'T KNOW HE'S IN THE AREA!"" Wont be using checker cab on my way home..."
14225,Get groceries and stuff here
14226,"Enjoyed our stay like we always do! And I love the salt water pool, though it was a bit cooler then normal."
14227,The hallway smelled musty and kind of stinky in the pool was empty and the lady at the front desk was not very nice at all customer service horrible I do not recommend extended stay but the rooms are cheap but yet what you pay for.
14228,Yes there is a yummy salsa bar there that alone is super yummy! Food and service both are great everytime!
14229,Great dive bar! Love it!
14230,We went in with hopes to get my husband and his brothers tattoos and the man who greeted them was very rude and not at all accommodating! He was behind the desk in the back asking questions then told them to come around! ALL IN ALL RUDE!!! DONT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!
14231,The ceviche was amazing!
14232,Nice rooms. Continental breakfast is horrid. Left my phone charger block in the room. And they said they couldn't find it. Doubt if they even looked.
14233,love to play here. always improving the course; they now have a full course plus
14234,Beautiful
14235,Always a friendly experience.
14236,The park needs fences by the street and water
14237,"Busy, but the clerk waited on me quickly, and my pizza was ready shortly after I paid for it."
14238,Only thing we found in Alaska that was HALF the price of what we normally pay in lower 48 for all the same snacks and tickets......which is funny because I was not expecting it to be cheaper.  Saw Valerian and loved it!  Would definitely come again next time we are in Fairbanks.  Made for a relaxing day.
14239,Great food and coffee in a lovely atmosphere.
14240,Not good service and portions ate small
14241,Got what I needed. Good trip.
14242,"Parking lot is large, fenced area is decent sized. There are doggy bags on site for cleaning up after your pet."
14243,"Uniquely themed Alaska original artwork. Quality Hoodies and T's and handful of other craft products and stickers. Also 1 of 2 ""Onewheel"" dealers in town.  Great place."
14244,"They are a great help with food needs for those who need it. Even if they do not yet believe in God, they are seeing a church that does good works in his name."
14245,really great Italian food   nice atmosphere too
14246,"Very good locally brewed beer, worth the short drive"
14247,Has location...but will they exist?
14248,Lots of stores
14249,They change the floor plan on the store it seems everytime I go here. Other than that they have most of everything I'm looking for at good prices with a reasonable variety. There's usually always a 5-10 min wait to check out. 20-60 min wait during any major holiday season.
14250,"Friendly staff, great surround sound, hard uncomfortable seats"
14251,Best latte ever
14252,It'll be better when cars goes back in Sears Mall and then they won't call the Sears Mall anymore cuz there's no more Sears
14253,"I love books, so"
14254,Great food great service great people!
14255,So good one of favorite places in Anchorage
14256,"Low quality food, slow service. I only liked their drinks, but other places have equal or higher quality even then. Nice staff."
14257,"Food great, cozy dinning"
14258,"Every time I have to make a stop at the craft store Michael’s, I have to have to go into the Petco. I am a huge animal lover I buy my dogs so many treats and toys weekly. So it shouldn’t be any surprise that I love Petco I feel like it offers so many more services then its competitors. They have classes open to the public for Animal training of all sorts. They got animal feed cages close leashes toys if you think your animal would love it it’s probably at the store. I always get the latest Animal treat samples for my dogs now I will say that some of them are pretty healthy as healthy alternatives for dogs so might be too picky dogs won’t need it but I have a pitbull that’s a garbage disposer, & He’s happy to take them all."
14259,"My fiancé and I went in for a few things and noticed there were boxes and stockpiled carts full of items to be put on shelves and also were blocking narrow aisles. Rude female customers in the makeup section that wouldn't move for the life of them while they stared at their phone scrolling by those said stockpiled carts. Then, asked for my receipt at the register for already-purchased makeup and looked at like I had stole it until my fiancé came back with an unbroken case of soda since one was broke and empty in the box. I guess with the ghetto side of town that's what a person can expect. Didn't find any corks in the arts aisle or in the kitchen utensils aisle either. Exiting, there was no employee to check our receipt. Good luck finding someone who speaks fluent or unbroken English working there."
14260,"Everytime I've ever gone, which is atleast once a year, is always over priced garbage food with the illusion of fine dining. Lousy service and when I have complained was told if I don't like it i can pay and leave when I didn't even touch the food. I have gotten better food from truck stops"
14261,A little pricey but really good food. Their house vinaigrette is amazing
14262,Good portions and good food.  Thank you!
14263,They are good but the hood I bought from them was bent at the front and won't shut all the way. I wish they would have told me that before I already bought the hood.
14264,"Low key atmosphere, excellent food, good wine list. Should be in best of Anchorage."
14265,Great food
14266,"Amazing portion sizes, seriously try the Ono Waffle and the Chicken Fiesta Skillet!"
14267,"What can I say, Independence Day weekend and they knock it out of the park with customer service. How, who knows? Place was hoping with live music, food and ATVs. We had a blast, fished and relaxed by the fire. Suzy and Alan are hands down the best on the Denali HWY. Make sure you visit in both the summer and winter. Two different sets of exploring."
14268,"Hands down #1 used furniture store in Anchorage. Great prices, amazing and consistently rotating stock. Most importantly the workers and service is phenomenal."
14269,Lady at the front desk was REALLY Rude. We just move from Columbus GA and we went in to ask questions. Will never go back here again.
14270,Dope place. I love their pre-rolls
14271,"I always feel like I'm getting a good honest deal when I go here. The staff are always very patient and knowledgeable when it comes to selecting the right cut of meat. And, if you want something amazing, get their marinated tri-tip. It is to die for!"
14272,"Over priced, lack of selection and staff were lost or had very little knowledge about the products they offered, I hope this improves as time passes (seeing how the store has only been open for a few weeks).
Store was beautiful and inviting
Parking non issue
Greeting personnel we're nice and inviting"
14273,We love stopping here for ice cream on out way home from our Cabin it's deliouces and fair priced. I would give it 5 stars but they really need to put some money into that place. 3 tables and it's a old nasty building.
14274,Awesome pizza and great beer selection to be had. A must stop....reasonable prices for what you get.
14275,"This was the worst motel/hotel experience I've ever had. My partner and I just moved and purchased a new bed. Unfortunately, the delivery of our new bed was delayed a day and we found ourselves with only the floor to sleep on, so we decided to find a hotel for the night. When we arrived at La Quinta, we told the folks at the front desk as much and asked for a room. I had also called asking if they had a room with a big bed available. They said  yes and when we arrived, I mentioned I was the one who had called about ten minutes prior. Even with all of this information and the rainbow Pride masks my partner and I were wearing, the homophobic receptionist put us in a room with two queens instead of a single king bed. Even if they were somehow confused, maybe because they lacked a well-rounded and cultured upbringing, they should always ask to clarify rather than assume. Rather than argue with the likely bigoted and unaccommodating receptionist, we decided to cope and squeezed into one of the queen sized beds because it was at least still better than the floor, I guess. When we woke up, we found breakfast was what a first grader might expect from a school cafeteria. In fact, I am certain the small cup of odd tasting, sour orange juice was the same stuff they gave us in elementary school. The $2 breakfast and awful customer service have left us certain to look elsewhere going forward. In the future, we know to check in with the local LGBTQIA+ community to know where to take our queer dollars. What a shame a restful nights sleep could be so soured."
14276,"I really have to give them some credit for being generous with their portions. I ordered a take out from them and then when I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised with their generous portion. Here is my word of reprimand to any customer who finds reasons to complain when they receive a big portion: Don't ever complain when a restaurant gives you lots of food! Just be thankful and take it home for your next meal."
14277,Nice place but no belugas.
14278,Didn't win but had a fabulous time anyway.
14279,"Floors were dirty, got the wrong food because it wasn't explained to me there was a massive difference, workers ate food up at the front counter in full view of customers, attitude wasn't very great either, they laughed at the issues I was having with understanding things they were saying. Tables were disgusting as well."
14280,So good! Squid kow mun extra squid.  *drool*.
14281,Love Wally world
14282,Hot food and good service. This time
14283,Good large supplies of every sewing items you need
14284,Great place
14285,"Used clothing, books, housewares. Can find good buys sometimes."
14286,Really good natural history museum.
14287,"Very nice place, good food and friendly lady"
14288,"Started today with a cinnamon vanilla latte at a coffee shop I wish I had the opportunity to visit more often. Dark Horse sits between the Denaina Convention Center, City Hall and the Robert Atwood Building, so they are always busy. But the atmosphere is always warm and the drinks are always great, so being part of the crowd here makes perfect sense. They also offer french press and tea pots for only $7, so it is easy to enjoy an extended morning stay while you read one of their complimentary Anchorage Daily News papers.  What I love most though, everyone is treated with respect here. I’ve know a few people between homes and jobs who might not have been welcomed in other establishments but are able to spend time out of the cold, enjoying a cup of coffee and a friendly game of cards (or one of the other games they have for customers to use). Their menu is good as well...extremely generous oatmeal portions!"
14289,Great place to enjoy food and floatplane

14298,The only place I go for running shoes. Great staff. Good service and selection.
14299,There's usually a long wait if you have to pick up something off the shelf.  You'll have to wait behind the lines of people who need parts researched  and ordered or picked up. I try to avoid this store if I'm in a hurry but the people are nice and they usually have the parts that I need.
14300,Crowded as always.. esp during holidays
14301,Great time by all
14302,I've never had a good experience here. No employees are around or when you find one they don't offer to help and look put out to do so. Customer service desk agents are terribly slow and unprofessional. There's always a ton of stuff in the aisle for sale making it difficult to get anywhere. Lowes has always been wonderful. Go there instead.
14303,Amazing crepes!!! Favorite place for lunch or breakfast. And prices can not be beat. Highly recommended!
14304,For all your warehouse needs
14305,Great pizza and wings. Probably best in Fairbanks.

14310,Awesome atmosphere
14311,Fun to watch them cook your dinner
14312,"Don't expect anything luxurious, but for less than $100 a night near Denali it's hard to beat.  A clean room with a bed and hot shower is really all you need when the whole point of the area is to be out exploring.  If you need a connection, there is complimentary WiFi."
14313,Great selection of fish. This is the only place to go if you want healthy fish.
14314,Nice
14315,This fellow has a great collection of rocks and sells lapidary equipment. A location for visiting for any rock hound

14317,Wonderful place & recommend a visit!!
14318,Great place great prices
14319,Too expensive for fast food

14321,The people there are quick. But if there's traffic it may take a few.

14342,"I like this place. Their fries were delicious, they have plenty of brews, and their sandwiches are good. I did have one waitress abscond with the basket I ate my sandwich out of before I finished my sandwich. Which I found odd. But I negate that negative experience with ANOTHER waitress who took great care of us. One of my favorite lunch options in Fairbanks."
14343,Produce and bulk item without crowds.

14349,"Average coffee, conversation seems more important than service."
14350,"Nice little gem with walking path, tables and exercise play equipment"
14351,"I was able to replace my daughter's phone here. They looked at it, quickly described the problems, discussed the estimate for repair vs cost for replacement. They even set up her new phone so it was working when we left the shop. Thanks!"
14352,"Went in needing some work done on my wife's chevy tracker. Ended up fixing it, but after we got it back the check engine light was on, which was not on before we brought it there. Said was both of our faults and they would give us a 50% discount on what needed to be fixed. But it was all their fault for not doing it right the first time, and just wanted to pass some of the blame on us(even though they did it to our vehicle). Feeling forced to agree with them because without fixing what they messed up in the first place, I wasn't sure where to turn. Paid an additional 490, for a problem they caused."
14353,Donuts are the best!
14354,Stunning views.
14355,Great pizza. Best price and taste in town.

14370,Beautiful
14371,The best wings and whiskey sours in town
14372,They have a bomb ass burger and the mac and cheese is to die for. 12 bucks for a burger that far away from anything is really worth it. Next time I'm in town I'm definitely going back.
14373,Busy safe and friendly
14374,"Enjoyed the hike, the view, and worth the view."
14375,"Bad service, expensive and poorly made Indian food and has no ventilation inside."
14376,An amazing place for a walk in woods and mountains! Easy to find off highway and just down road from Mirror Lake.
14377,"Personal, I think they have the best premium burgers of the chain fast food joints in Anchorage. Somewhat greasy, but more fresh tasting than the others."
14378,Best fast food place ever. This one was just remodeled and is downright fancy now.
14379,"Good drinks, good food in a nice, but relaxed wood-paneled bar.  Great servers"
14380,"I got my eyebrows waxed here after getting them messed up at another salon, and they came out great! Sage (I think her name was) took her time to make sure they came out even and corrected the mess up from before.  Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and I definitely plan on going back :)"
14381,"This is an amazing park, not only because of the sheer size of it but also because of it's pristine environment. This place is a prime example of what we can do to help nature remain the same without human encroachment. Beautiful scenery and amazing vistas in a park greater than some of the continental states."
14382,Okay summer meal . lots of tourists
14383,Louie's is a great local bar always wonderful friendly people! Great food out back at Nano's!!! Last time I was here a local brought in smoked salmon and shared with us all 🥰
14384,"Inquiry
Great interaction up front with the sales/counter crew both phone and email. Appointment was able to be set only days after my call date.

Dropoff
Perfectionist makes it very easy to leave keys+message after hours. I visited during business hours a day early and left my truck then. The shop and storefront are very clean and professional!

Install day
Front and rear dashcam (Blackvue 650) + drone autostart (Groupon) were done by early afternoon.

Pickup
The app and drone details were covered as well as security and remote/swap options. Camera mount was clean and toggle switch located just where I asked. Slack in the cable will make it easy to reposition if needed.

Loved the service and the outcome!! I'll be back again soon."

14408,If you like random buffet style Oriental type food this is a good one for you. Prices are reasonable and we've never left hungry.

14429,Beautiful RV park and great location

14471,"If you're looking for a hot cup of coffee in Downtown Anchorage then Kaladi Brothers Coffee has your back.

Perfect location right next to the Downtown Transit Center, so you can have a hot cup of coffee for the bus ride.  I wouldn't say a quick cup of coffee because sometimes the line can go out the door.  This location really needs two cash registers.

The store layout is designed for more tables than merchandise, so you should stay and do some people watching.  I really appreciate the space around the tables and chairs too."
14472,Excellent customer service and no pressure to buy from Gene.
14473,Money gram
14474,"Come for the shopping, stay for the free samples. There is almost always an employee who offers to take the cart from me. And the staff is super helpful"
14475,Its fine but there was to much people cussing the b f n word
14476,A great steak. I don't know if they do any other dishes well here because it's a steakhouse. You order steak. You won't be disappointed.

14478,Great soups and sandwiches!
14479,"I always love TGI Fridays, good signature drink, awesome food, but bartenders are not Showtenders or perform any flair skills like other TGI Fridays. Also, the WIFI is always down. If you don't mind not having the shows that the classic TGI Fridays does stop by and enjoy the restaurant and bar."
14480,Excellent customer service by the carpet department at Home Depot it was outstanding he should be recognized for his great skills in working with all those different types of carpet he has great people skills in an outstanding Veteran
14481,amazing selection and presentation felt like I was in Amsterdam
14482,Great view of glaciers and wildlife
14483,"Different entertainment, hammer dulcimer, first time here. People were friendly"
14484,Only two checkers you have to use self checkout or wait thirty minutes.the one lady can't work and talk and she much rather talk. The self checkout although the did away with bags they left the hanger frames and the took up all the space if you try to load back into your cart the situated sensors freeze if you can say a 12 pm of sodas there's no place to put them.or expect the non user friendly register to lock up and call the poor worker handling 6 to 8 registers himself. Lol he's doing a great job.
14485,"We don't shop at Wal-Mart very often, but I have learned my lesson a out buying produce there. Twice now items have been much more than the tag. First blueberries were twice as much as they were marked and today grapes were supposed to be a flat price but when we checked out were by the pound and more than twice the flat price on the tag. Just beware."
14486,"Unbelievable! Best in Anchorage, hands down."
14487,They really need remodel and make sure the food is not dried out by not leaving it out untill it's gone.
14488,Excellent sandwich and friendly waItress

14495,Had a great time watching the movie. The staff was awesome in handling very large group. They've done this before I can tell. Good job

14505,Oh my goodness this place has amazingly delicious food! I had biscuits and gravy plate. My mom had the sausage patty breakfast.

14508,"Enjoying the natural beauty and environment of Denail, Alaska."
14509,wonderful stop on a long journey. denali was not out so this is all I got.
14510,"Unfortunately, it was our first time there and we had the worst server since moving to Alaska. Truly unfortunate because we brought family visiting after having the best day on Girdwood. Terrible ending to an awesome day. We only got as far as the appetizer, but we will say that if the stuffed mushrooms were any indication of the quality of food, the rest must be amazing! We also had drinks. One of our drinks, the crown and water, was very watery. When we asked that it be fixed or changed, that server rudely told us that it was because it was a crown and water and that they are strict about making sure the crown is exactly 2.5 oz. We then asked for crown without water and mixed it with the same amount of water and it was significantly darker in color than the watery drink. We highly recommend Seven Glaciers Bar instead. We had the exact same drinks there and they were tons better. Thankfully, the manager apologized and reassured us that she would address the issue head on with the server. We hope so in the event we dare chance bringing people there again. She even made some recommendations to other restaurants in the area we could try insteaf. The ambiance was fun and family oriented. We paid for the appetizer and drinks and left before dinner ever made it out."
14511,Grubbing
14512,Ate here a few times. It is not a bad place but the variety is not that great especially when it comes to veggies. Better than 3 stars but not really 4.
14513,It's fast and McDonald's
14514,"Steamer Clams were awesome, great service."
14515,"Amazing options, Quickest service, and best breakfast in Fairbanks. I'd recommend their cheese steak for lunch or dinner."

14517,Great service and the best tasting ice cream in town
14518,"They offer a variety of different size, age and model vehicles with affordable prices. They also walk through the vehicle with you and show you how to work everything instead of watiching a video. I definitely recommend them."
14519,"Good food! Good vegan options, which I am always looking for. Could be more, though! Wait times can be a little crazy. If you have some time to spare, overall a good place to check out."

Our educational bird was Spirit; watching her eat salmon eggs out of her handlers hand while making her little squaks was so cool! Highly recommend"
14551,Great place good food and good people
14552,"So happy we finally have an Arby's in Fairbanks! The service is quick, and the food is great."

14556,"A splendid dinning experience, very friendly, good food, friendly and patient with my young kids, very accommodating of a large group. Expensive but well worth the cost."

14568,Good food.  No air conditioner. Covered patio outside
14569,Best sandwich you can get in the area! Homemade bread and cookies!!! The servers usually have great service and they support local artists!
14570,"The food, the rides, the vendors, and the crowd. If you live in Alaska, chances are you have been to the state fair in Palmer. Traffic can be a little hectic and the lines you are willing to wait in can be a small wait. A great time for family of all ages or if you travel with a group of friends. Definitely a lot to do and see here. Highly recommend."
14571,One of the last true barber shops! I've been going for years and the entire staff is great
14572,Has most of the stuff we need
14573,"Cheeseburger*
It was a good burger, but I wasn't crazy about it. I did like that they put the toppings on the bottom. The fries were great.
Everything is a little spendy in Seward. So, this was $14."
14574,"A full fledged large fantastic gym with a steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, massages,  aerobics, and more."
14575,I love costco
14576,"Half Baked Bannana Bread is to die for , absolutely the best flavor I have had , must try"
14577,Great pricing but slow service when they were not busy.
14578,They Showed me Excellent in Customer Service. 😀
14579,"The waitress was very attentive and friendly. Service was good. Food took much longer than expected with the number of patrons dining in. Food tasted okay, but looked a little sad on plate. Not too expensive."
14580,"Good whole food, old style restaurant."
14581,Hit or miss on getting orders quckly. Overall ok.
14582,"I love this place, the staff is just amazing.  The quality of there products is the best in town."
14583,"I shopped here a lot as a college student. It's conveniently located, and the prices are competitive with other stores in town, although by no means the best. The staff are friendly and helpful. The parking lot is a nightmare though. Take care when walking or parking here."
14584,Good selection of food at a good price
14585,I love going to taco bell anywhere at anytime.
14586,Great service.  Beautiful work for both manicures and pedicures.
14587,The sandwiches we were huge & yummy! It's pretty pricey though - but really well created.
14588,Still the same... It's the flat come on
14589,Great place to go watch shows/sports. My only complaint would be that the concession stand is right after the entrance so when you come in getting through the crowd is a little annoying but otherwise great place.
14590,Food is great but there's not space at tables if you have little baby's and no changing table.
14591,Great
14592,Only late delivery.
14593,Terrible food terrible service waste of time
14594,"This is a decent Petco. Normally Petco as a company has terrible reviews for how they keep the store and the animals. The fish tanks are always an issue as far as fish being alive here, which frustrates me. And the area for the ferrets is always terrible. I wish they'd take better care of the animals. But... Friendly and quiet, generally. We do enjoy bringing our dog in. Pricier than Walmart, and they carry some of the same things. They do offer some items that Cold Spot doesn't (we prefer Cold Spot for our dog), and of course if you have other pets like fish or rodents etc. this is the place to go. HOWEVER, stay away from the groomer. Our second groom had our dog half done and traumatized. One of the gals at the groomer counter is not friendly, either. Not worth even half the price we paid. We found a much better groomer. But for a pet store, it's decent, when you have limited options."
14595,Nice place to get a cup of hot chocolate
14596,Absolutely delicious! Fast and friendly! Had the Carne Asada Burrito and it was perfect!
14597,Best time
14598,Best southern cooking in Alaska and great hospitality.
14599,"I could see the frozen bay with the village as well, unique and wonderful experience! The rooms were very clean. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful! I had a hard time sleeping because it was so quiet and the front desk staff provided me with a fan right away. Love this place! Will definitely come back!"
14600,Like a smaller fredmyers
14601,Perk up on prospect or Glenn highway is always a positive place to be
14602,Where wife and I first kissed!
14603,One of my favorite places to get steak.
14604,"Dropped into get some items I forgot on my move, everyone was super helpful in helping finding what i needed!"

14617,Amazing boardwalk and facilities.  The amount of birds we were able to see and photographs in less than hour was outstanding.
14618,Huge variety of shows and numerous shows all year long!
14619,Wendy the waitress was awesome. The food is typical Alaska. Over rated..  The Beer. GREAT!
14620,Always delicious no matter what I oeder!
14621,Our Favorite place to eat.  Service has always been friendly.  Large groups we have are always treated promptly.  We've had the best dining experiences of any restaurant in town.
14622,I am regular here as I have bought and traded guitars for at least 3 years at this place. The people working are wonderful however they never remember me though. lol
14623,"Lowest price, not crowded"
14624,Love Ray's place!! Super sweet service and always delicious food!! ♡
14625,They have a Bass Pro shop here.
14626,"This place isn't what it used to be, unfortunately. I gave it a few more tries but it's just not that great."
14627,Best place to find the perfect gift for you or yours with a selection that's second to nun
14628,Extremely helpful and nice
14629,The air worked! The bed was nice.
14630,Some of the Best Burgers and Shakes in Anchorage!

14632,The melt is great.  People are nice and there is fast service.
14633,Quick hot breakfast. No complaints here. 🤓
14634,Great place for pet supplies.
14635,Beats shopping at Wal-Mart    can hardly ever find someone to help when you need them
14636,Helpful employee but didn't have what I needed.
14637,Better than ATT
14638,I never really cared about weither i went to the womens only side vs the normal side but started going on the womens side and the atmosphere is slightly different for the better and i realize i am more comfortable on that side and prefer it now. So glad i have that option.
14639,It's awesome
14640,A great place for a cup of ice cream.
14641,Love the drive thru
14642,"Got in and out real quick with new wiper blades too, and reasonable. Wonderful people too."
14643,Sears and BURGERFI are good stores to visit reasonable prices and good parking
14644,Great food and fast.
14645,I do enjoy there sandwiches. Worth the trip. Staff are nice.
14646,It has everything!
14647,We had a great mother daughter pedicures.
14648,Coaches of all sizes equipment maintained and explained before you go.
14649,Best Mexican food in anchorage hands down huge portions authentic and have some good deals great margaritas
14650,Good burgers and love the smoked turkey sandwich but hate that it's cash only. Fun in the summer when you can eat outside by the creek.
14651,Nice time
14652,Not worth the money if all the amenities are shut down.
14653,Great embroidery!  Awesome gear-
14654,"Incredible views and beautiful lodge. Winter pricing was still pricy considering nothing is included (ie no continental breakfast, only 2 servings of flavored coffee in room). Would have given more stars except for the following: not all staff followed Hotel's stated COVID mitigation policy (which was to wear masks, including for the kitchen staff where it really counts), and the live music was too loud indoors-I could hardly hear the front desk clear during check-in. Also it was very very crowded and most guests had no masks, which was disappointing to see and didn't make me feel comfortable enjoying the huge fireplace since it was so crowded. We did not get the Northern Lights alert from front desk that I tried to sign up for though we still caught them. I liked how the Northern Lights and weather forecast was posted for guests. The local music in the evening was a nice touch even if it was way over-amplified for indoors setting."
14655,Eating the food its great
14656,Best donut in town ;)
14657,Its a Walmart
14658,They're remodeling/reorganizing so its a little disorienting. Still good though
14659,Been going to Marisas since I moved to Alaska in 2010.  I started going there because it was close to my house.   Ive since bought a home on the other side of town and I drive past a dozen nail salons to keep going back to Marisa!
14660,"Beautiful views, gateway to adventure."
14661,"Good prices,  and have everything needed, but staff is not helpful and hard to find and when you finally find them the are clueless."
14662,"Basic place, food is good.  It's clean and bright."
14663,They will pick you car up and drop it back off. Good prices and great work.
14664,"It's cheep food you can get without leaving a car. If you want more, you shouldn't be at a fast food place."
14665,"The last time we ate breakfast here it was ""pie"" day so I bought a pie and it was so good. Our breakfast was great and my kids were kinda crazy but the employees were very patient and understanding. We had great service and food. My kids ordered Mac and Cheese and 8am and they catered to their desires :)"
14666,It's obvious ownership has given up on reinventing in this business.
14667,Nice park. Nice couple that took me out once. Showed me an olive branch at wendys
14668,"This place was very good! We realized in the nick of time that they closed from 2pm-4pm and called just after 2pm for a takeout order. It was no problem, they got our order together quickly and it was just what we were craving. I got the eggplant (Baigan Bharta) and my husband got the Tikka Masala with goat meat. We split a garlic naan bread. The Tikka Masala had great flavor, the goat meat may have been a little tough, but overall a good choice. The eggplant was a little on the blander side, but with a tad of salt, was quite good. Looking forward to trying some more dishes!"
14669,Get place for the stash.
14670,Very helpful staff. Great dog trainer
14671,"My husband loves this place and I honestly don't mind coming here every weekend either. Heh.
Frontier Outfitters has a very wide variety of goods - fishing, hunting, camping, clothes, knives, guns, canning, lodge cast iron goods, and so much more. My favorite thing here is all of the Lodge cast iron skillets and cook books and pans. My husband loves looking at the guns and knives. They have good boots and shoes here and a wide variety of women's and mens clothing to choose from too.
The staff here are funny, helpful, and friendly. They have pretty good prices and so many things to look at. I swear I find something new every time we come here - believe me, it's at least once every single weekend. And I'm still loving it."
14672,"(Translated by Google) theft. prices

(Original)
goid. prices"
14673,Always great
14674,"The friendliness of the staff gives this place two stars, otherwise it was be one star. The room was dirty, there was hair on the bathroom floor and the shower needs to be caulked properly. The common areas were nice, but I will not be coming back unless there is a change to the maintenance and cleanliness of the rooms."
14675,"Ate a late lunch with a coworker. Service was fast and friendly. Food drove the 3 stars for this review. Had the applewood bacon burger. Nothing really special about it. Very middle of the pack when it comes to taste and quality. Pike's has been around for a long time. I would stick with their dinner menu. If your looking for that ""slap someone so good"" burger I would bypass Pike's."
14676,NICE
14677,"Great food, reasonable prices, conveniently located & Cynthia is always smiling & delivering excellent customer service, every time we visit this restaurant! She's a very exceptional employee."
14678,Got most of our project stuff. Very helpful
14679,Did not deliver. We ordered for delivery after an hour I received a call that they couldn't deliver because it was too far. We were stuck behind the delivery driver almost all the way back to our house.
14680,"Quality products, friendly staff, quick help, was a little busy but that just shows the demand of their products."
14681,"Very slow, even in the drive thru. We went here 2 times and the one on Palmer 2 times for ice cream only and the one in palmer was faster by far. The one time the guy in the drive thru just said welcome, so I waited for the rest of his ""script"", but then he just said hello again like he was annoyed I didn't answer him. Not very professional. Gave them 3 stars because at least they got the root beer float and small blizzards right, but drive the extra few miles and go to Palmer instead."
14682,Excellent from start to finish
14683,Always helpful whenever I come in.
14684,Its mcdonalds
14685,Great visit as usual
14686,Not good for people with health issues and can not wear a mask...
14687,Great store
14688,Ever since they've remodeled the theaters this is my favorite place to watch movies. Seats are very comfortable.
14689,Excellent
14690,"Whether it's a once in a while adjustment or regular service, Dr. Parliament is the best around!"
14691,Great place for lunch dame great food as dinner
14692,I thought this was a pretty neat mall. Loved the set up and all the levels. Made it interesting!!
14693,Can find interesting items at great deals.
14694,"Good food, good service. Plenty of seating"
14695,"I've eaten there twice and It's much better than I expected. If you're at this airport, I recommended this place."
14696,Good  but a little pricey. 7 bucks for a small vanilla cone.
14697,"Our server, Joe, was great. The food however was mediocre at best. I understand that when it comes to cooking for the general public you have to be careful about seasonings and all, but the rib eye steak was beyond bland."
14698,"I have gone here multiple times and had wonderful experiences. It is clean and the staff is friendly. Most importantly, they did a great job on my eye exam."
14699,Huge selection
14700,fast friendly service
14701,"Down home style, not fancy but good, quick and friendly neighborhood place to eat at. My kind of place."
14702,"You must already know. But if you've never done, it's addictive"
14703,Pitiful selection
14704,"Good food, friendly staff"
14705,The only bad experience I've had here was with hunting and fishing license. They didn't put the store info in which makes the license invalid. I had to buy a second one because of this. Other than that it's a great place
14706,"Food was okay, jack Daniels Teriyaki chicken appetizers were meh, they weren’t fried enough or flavored that well, strips were too big. The fries were super salty and the ribs weren’t that seasoned either. Won’t be back for awhile."
14707,"Nice scenery, prompt ferry."
14708,"Great for pics, bikr rides and archery"
14709,Always come for my trailer needs
14710,Nice owner
14711,"Not a great waiting area, but the service is usually way faster than expected."
14712,The drive is worth the blueberry flavor in a waffle. Mmm. Make sure you check there schedule. They may be closed for the winter.
14713,"You going to get stuck, break something, break somthing else, drown your truck, Jeep, Quad etc.. because you though that puddle wasnt that deep and so on, but make sure to wash after, the sut is hard to get off everywhere"
14714,Staight forword nd knowledgeable
14715,I always get a great haircut here. The staff is always friendly 😉.
14716,"There is a great deal of construction going on right now, and the dining room wasn't even open.  So 3 stars.  When the construction is done, it might hop up to 4 or 5 stars."
14717,Great staff very helpful even came out and helped install the bike rack I purchased.
14718,"Worth one go. Can't vouch for anything passed that.

Had anywhere from 1-3 high school aged personnel, with 1 of them at any given time busy with her friends and/or telling customers all the things they would not want to hear. Not limited to other persons urinating in the foam pits, or squatters residing within the establishment.
The place is starting to show where they don't clean and the foam blocks are being reduced to particulate that gathers on the proprietary socks.

When they first opened it was very different than what it has become. They had employees all over, regulating the rules and keeping order, that is no longer the case. I had some employees more caught up with me talking to my child in the child only zone but had nothing to say to the individual who was half way through the trampoline, headed under through the springs.

Not sure if you need to train the staff but it certainly couldn't hurt.

Make sure to actually secure anything you define as valuable, your belongings will be thoroughly gone through if put in the cubbies."
14719,Great Service.
14720,"Nice collection of historical tribal associated books available here ,feel great."
14721,"The staff is exceptional providing exemplary customer service.  The ability for them to accommodate quick appointment requests is outstanding.  I was experiencing severe tooth pain and the front counter customer service representative Michelle was able to promptly assist in providing me an appointment.  I was seen by Dr. Oudin, who expertly reviewed my tooth pain and then provided several options ensuring cost effectiveness was a consideration for the patient. The whole experience is by far the best service you can find.  All patrons are treated exceptionally well with courteousness and a smile being always willing to assist."
14722,They have EVERYTHING you need!
14723,Love the food and service.  Please order from this restaurant especially now.   The food is really good and I for one would hate to see it go under.  You wont regret eating anything they offer.
14724,Fast low price
14725,"Great coffee, prices, and friendly staff."
14726,Great food! Great proportions!
14727,"Was cozy and comfortable despite being located in a strip mall stall.  The wait staff were friendly and quick.
The other patrons when I went were generally early to late middle aged and did not have children with them.
The food was nice though not necessarily my most favorite that I have had from that part of the world.  Would not say no to going again if friends wanted to head there."
14728,Location
14729,Fresh donuts and great variety.
14730,Beautiful
14731,This was a strange nicknacks shop. They sold almost everything. They did have actually fur for sale too.
14732,"Clean shop , nothing too wrong with it except the prices. I can literally get anything they sell there for 75% less"
14733,Good ice cream
14734,Great variaty of products.
14735,Biggest store without clothing...
14736,some of the better Fairbanks bistro grub.
14737,"Fun, informative outing."
14738,"I don't like regis anymore, but I hate great clups, clips or whaever they call themselves now. great whate ever didn't even wash my hair and they cut it with firm hold hair gel and I asked them to fix it and they said thats all can do! I told them you wash out that gel you can do the job right! They just said You are done. hate regis and great clups clips whatever!"
14739,A classic stop.  The milkshake offerings and onion rings are my personal favorites... And the always pleasant service!
14740,"Great store. Loaded with hunting, fishing and outdoor gear.
Full hardware and marine supplies.
Will be back for foul weather clothes."
14741,A great park!
14742,Good food
14743,"Expensive for the price, especially the wings. It's a decent place though."
14744,Great cold sandwichs
14745,Staff was friendly and helpful. Fast service.
14746,Friendly grate curry
14747,"Breakfast is delicious, dinner not so great."
14748,I love coming here! One of my favorite places!
14749,"Food quality used to be a range of somewhat decent to pretty good, but lately budget cut backs have made the per person price skyrocket and the quality go down."
14750,"Point Woronzof never disappoints. Great for short hikes, wide views of Downtown and the Inlet, and in the winter, it's one of the most southerly places in the world to walk on sea ice. I've heard nighttime views of the Northern Lights are common here plus it lines up with the airport runway, so you also get the thrill of ginormous jets zooming just overhead. Just don't think of it as a beach. That's the one thing it's not."
14751,Good seating good food and drink
14752,Great views of Denali and walking trails .
14753,Great place with great people
14754,Slightly rude. Foods alright.
14755,Must get the pie. The best in the state. The food and coffee is amazing. Even better in the winter.
14756,"First time there, and it was worth it. Great food."
14757,Service was lacking. Bartender could not pour a double. The prices of their food was crazy expensive. Felt like i was being scammed the whole time. After an hour of waiting and 2 drinks. 1 of which i had to walk to the bar to get service. We had to leave. Everywhere else was way better. Shame.
14758,Service was a little slow and the food took longer than expected.  It wasn't crowded.  Caribbean jerk wings were Hella bomb and the onion rings.
14759,"busy busy, good deals tho"
14760,Always friendly and cheerful crew with fast service. Wonderful people and amazing food.
14761,"Good food , large portions, fairly pricey though."
14762,Great exhibits and wonderful informative staff.
14763,Really cool shop. He has great carving from horns and antlers. The shop is filled with things you just don't see very often in the lower 48. He also has rocks from all over the country for purchase.
14764,I grew up going to this park. So cool that I get to bring my son here to play.
14765,"The breakfast here is fine but that's all that I would consider. It's a pretty dirty place. Small bits of food, menus, and utensils under all the seats. Wouldn't be surprised if the kitchen had the same level of cleanliness."
14766,Easy access
14767,Great staff with top not quality service.  I highly recommend this place for buying an new atv or side by side. They run great specials on new machines. Only problem I had was that after market parts seemed a bit pricey.  Service was impeccable and I enjoyed my buying experience I didn't feel overwhelmed or pressured to buy.
14768,Food
14769,I don't stop by here every day but their specials usually catch my attention. This day I was able to get an awesome coffee and a pastry at an affordable price. Yesterday I noticed another time-limited special and took advantage of that as well. Starbucks coffees are uniformly delicious and I have quite a fondness for their coffeecakes and scones as well. Stop in next time you're in the neighborhood!
14770,Found what we were looking for.  Busy on Saturday afternoon.  No problem.
14771,Had a good time with my kids there.  Waiter was very patient with my kids and the food was great!  Arrived on time.  Love taking my kids there :)
14772,Love this place! Great food! Great atmosphere! I'm a regular there! The owner is a solid cat!
14773,Fast and friendly service.  The best mozzarella  sticks I have ever had.   I hadthe meat canzone it was fantastic.
14774,"Great place to spend a relaxing weekend. Go for a hike to Full Rock, go gold panning right down the road, or air back at the camp site and relax with your favorite beverage.  Camp host does a great job keeping the facilities clean.  Scenic drive is great getting here from Anchorage."
14775,Good place to get a haircut they seem to know what they're doing
14776,"Seats aren't as comfortable as Century, but it's a convenient spot in town to see a movie."
14777,Good food. Good service. Not bad by any means.
14778,Friendly and helpful staff that are most concerned with getting you out on your bike even if it isn't one that they sold you. They have helped me keep my hacked together fat bike up and running and provided great support for all of the parts and pieces I have purchased from them. I have now ended up purchasing more bikes for my family and encouraged most of the people I know to shop at Goldstream sports because They are the best bike shop in Fairbanks.  I end up stopping by their shop about once a week just to say hi see what new things they have.
14779,Excellent food and service👍👍👍👍👍
14780,I highly recommend  this place to anyone that is looking for a vehicle to purchase the guys working there are very nice and work with you in anyway they possibly can
14781,There pizza used to be good and full of flavor but now it always shows up soggy
14782,If you love slow expensive internet along with terrible customer serive this is the company for you! Otherwise steer clear of Alaska communications I Waited on hold for thirty minutes only for the company to say they are not providing costumer service inside houses. They are using COVID as an excuse for terrible customer service. If you have another option use it. I don’t write negative reviews often but Alaska communications is truly terrible.
14783,"They make the best ice cream, hands down, and the staff are always courteous, helpful, patient, and happy."
14784,"Kinda messy. But cute birds, turtles and fish 🐦🐢🐠"
14785,VERY SLOW SERVICE. WAY to much bread vs meat.  Wont go back
14786,"I go here for two reasons first to make copies from their printer because my printer makes like twenty copies then needs a ink cartridge refill that costs like $35.00 for two since that is the only one available and when, I am about to order a book on Amazon, I Check their website to make sure they do not have it if they do it to saves me waiting potentially a week to get it in the mail only to have the 10% chance happen where it gets Porched pirated."
14787,Great
14788,Very nice visitors center for being in the wilderness
14789,"I feel when my dog Sam was seen here that they helped and he is doing great now.
It was very busy they had a vet emergency and they handled owners/ parents of the pets with compassion and kindness.
The over all care of my dog  was great."

14807,Clean
14808,"Loved the pho, but I really wanted Ox tail, but it wasn't on the menu, but the steak pho I had was delicious.  I also had the shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce and enjoyed every bite.  Definitely want to try more menu items."
14809,"Food and staff were excellent (5 stars) but they were having an issue with flies in the building, mostly near the trash collection area. Probably just needs monitored and emptied a bit more often."

14841,Lazy tool section people and lazy receivers. The electrical section is good though.
14842,"Great value and a very interesting place. We got a room with our own bathroom and it was nice not to share. The room was small, but not cramped.

Fixtures and furniture was old, but ""unique"" so it was okay. My wife and I both woke up a few times with discomfort with the mattress, but weren't sore the next day.

I would give 4 stars, but the cleaning needs to be greatly improved! There was large debris on the floor, it wasnt vacuumed. And there was some hair on the shower wall, it wasnt wiped down.

The staff was nice and helpful, and we had no issues with our reservation through a hotel booking site.

You get what you pay for. For the price,  I enjoyed it. I would not go there again, though, until they get serious cleaning, and maybe time for new mattresses."
14843,Good coffee options.  Must have been new staff...
14844,There the best
14845,Great spot for hiking
14846,I love the concept but I do not like that there are no tokens. Salad bar was old and gross.

14848,This ain't Starbucks...🥺
14849,This place rocks for buying ammo and targets before going to the Birchwood shooting range.

Awesome workers. ..Don't change a thing."
14856,"I love this place! The food is great, and the waiters are so polite. I go fairly often for the rare steak pho(probably my favorite meal besides the chicken pad thai or medium beef larb), and they remember me which is always nice. Highly reccomend them, so much better than Phonatik."
14857,"Some of the prices are a little higher than I expected, but I usually find something I like here."
14858,Satisfying down home greasy spoon
14859,"Flown with Sheldon Air Service twice now. SAS did an excellent job accommodating myself and my company. I truly believe there is a difference with how they treat their customers compared to similar services in the area. From scheduling a flight to meet our needs to ensuring that we had the best experience the weather would allow, Sheldon Air Service exceeded our expectations."

14878,"This place is amazing! I love their chicken.

14880,Love it
14881,"Jeff Brown, the host at Wonder Lake, went above and beyond! He answered questions, gave advice, and even provided duct tape to repair broken boots--and always with a smile. We could not have asked for better. Doris, the ranger, was very friendly, genuine, and helpful. Makes for a memorable experience even in less-than ideal weather."
14882,Great southern food and atmosphere

14903,They'll call the cops on you if they don't like you
14904,"The visitors center is closed for the winter. We met up with a couple of other families to hike & ski across the frozen lake to see the other side. The outhouse is full and frozen, so it is locked up until it thaws enough to pump. It was a fun adventure 😊. Please be aware that the wind chill on the lake makes it much colder."
14905,What a crock. While others work to accommodate pets and service animals this place does not. They need to be reminded that it's Alaska and not 5th Avenue in NYC.
14906,Meh its arbys
14907,Wish the were bigger. Good prices on bulk stuff

14920,"The classic roast beef I received was a little cooler than I would have liked, but it wasn't so cold that I couldn't eat it. I went through the drive thru which is something I very seldom do but was in a hurry which is another thing I don't like being in a hurry to eat. Service was speedy the young man working the window was polite. Can't say anything about the inside of the building which is another thing I don't like about drive thrus."
14921,Very personable staff
14922,Love those hotdods!
14923,Great environment with great people
14924,Awesome place to go Korean BBQ! Very nice staff!
14925,Nice rooms with little kitchenettes. Good staff and a nice resteraunt. Good place for the price. Only complaint is that we found trash in on of the beds.
14926,Ok
14927,"Great waffles, not my favorite gravy (bit bland) but best BLT ever!!"
14928,"They were helpful, Jack especially. In determining the health of the battery I brought in. It was dead, exchanged it and bought a new one."

So dry it sucked the moisture out of my mouth. I am from San Antonio, TX.....always looking for good Mexican food in Alaska. Still looking......"
14935,We visited from out of town and this place struck me as a great local shop that attracts a community of like minded people.
14936,My Malamute-Husky mix always comes out to clean and fluffy!
14937,I have been to war memorial in Washington DC and this one in Delaney Park rates among them as one of the best.
14938,The people here really know what they're doing and show that they really care about the people that you're working on and this is one place that I would recommend to anybody that needs orthopedic surgery

14943,This is a winter wonderland when the snow is deep and incredibly beautiful in the Fall.
14944,I went with my beautiful friend and our kiddos to have lunch. It was busy inside but we had good service and great meals. Portions were enough to bring and eat more at home.
14945,"Best Mexican in Alaska, hands down!!"
14946,Beautiful
14947,Atmosphere was good but the food was subpar. Kind of dissapointing

14951,The staff were much more friendly today than the last couple of times I've been there.

14954,Love their service and Outlaws!
14955,"Great time, well kept facilities with lots to read. Slightly kid oriented, which is to be expected. The exhibits are well laid out and you can get really close to the animals. Fun for all"
14956,"Fun bar, good divey feel. Real nice bartenders. Gets popular after midnight."
14957,Nice Subway restraunt. I like how you are greeted by the sandwich artists no matter how busy they are as soon as you walk in. Clean and always reliable on speed and quality.

14959,Best coffee shack around
14960,Best sushi in town. Friendly and almost always go the extra mile.
14961,Awesome!!! But so sad all glacier will decrease every year.

14963,Everyone was so kind!
14964,The service was outstanding.
14965,Clean bathrooms!!
14966,"I'm giving one star because on their monitors they advertise a promo. But when I asked for that deal, I was told that that prompted wasnt good since November. I guess I'm petty"
14967,A bit pricy
14968,"Really good, fun atmosphere with good food. We had cheesy bread sticks, kebaps, and a calzone. Everything was delicious."
14969,"Great service!  Personable and knowledgeable  employees.  No pressure sales, competitive prices."
14970,"I just love Bailey's furnature store. They did me good. Got a dinning room set, a super bed, a recliner, and love seat that reclines also. Super delivery. Whats not to love."
14971,"They have good food,but cost a little too much"
14972,Pizza here is fantastic!
14973,Friendly staff and great service all around! I live my truck and they help me take good care of it. One thing I would change would be the constant political news in the waiting room. Thankfully they have a TV free place by the coffee many of us chose to sit at instead.
14974,"I sat there almost 30 min in line for a car wash that didn't even get my car clean, and was OUTRAGEOUSLY over priced... $$22 for what? To watch the water run down the drain before it cycled over MY CAR ONCE? NO THANKS...

Expiry I was feeling with an angry 2 year old and didn't proof read"
14975,Yummy
14976,Because they have expensive prices it's $18.00 for one regular hamburger a frecken hamburger and $25.95 just for one medium pizza with out a drink and you only can get take out when they have a food special I would come here ever again
14977,"The best coffee shop in Wasilla. If you don't like what perkup is doing buying out everyone in the valley, go here!"

14985,"Nice, cozy cabins"
14986,"Cool place to visit, 3 minutes walking from the pier.. just get what you need and continue your day..."
14987,"The staff and food here are top notch. They have a robust beer menu and their recent-ish full bar upgrade really elevates the experience. I especially recommend getting a table served by Christy, as she is an exceptional server."
14988,Share you go for healing
14989,"If your someone easily obsessed with Christmas, this is your stop. Tourist trap with Mr. And Mrs. Claus for a photo op. There's reindeer on the property. Massive rooms with endless Christmas related items"
14990,the nice place and the delicious food.
14991,"Horrible costumer service! My friend couldn't cancel after a health issue and not being able to go to the  gym anymore, they kept an lying to her.."
14992,"Good place to get a Costco deal. Customer service either above and beyond or just terrible.  You ever know what you’re going to get.  I do love the pharmacy here though, the savings completely pays for the membership in one refill of my meds. But for a two person household there is no need for executive level membership."
14993,"Reasonable. Hot showers. Not marked out very well, campground.  Well stocked store."
14994,Nice place to shop
14995,Always fantastic service and the food is so fresh and delicious
14996,My favorite Italian restaurant in Anchorage!!
14997,I wish I could go there all the time so many choices
14998,Trying to buy a chest freezer and while they have one on the floor I'm being told I can't buy it and they are out of stock otherwise.  That deserves a one star.
14999,See Donna. She is the best!
15000,Nice little place 2 stop and see
15001,"The Beyond Burger was magnificent!  Loved it!  Service was good - I asked for no bread of any kind, and they gave me extra large pieces of lettuce.   I asked for a big salad, and no problem.  I asked for sauteed veggies on the burger, no problem.  I ate every bite!  Cost a bit more, but no problem.  I recommend!"
15002,"Service department will make you pull your hair out, and usually after the truck goes in a secound time its fixed"
15003,"Great Food. Great Staff,"
15004,Some peeps got kicked out for shoplifting and yeah it was pretty lit
15005,A very nice theatre with a unique concession stand.
15006,😜
15007,Was pleasantly suprised they have many dishes besides sushi.  Very good.  And great service.
15008,Very nice place and good food I had the halibut and chips and they were very good. Kids had the ribs and pasta. The kids pasta was in a cream sauce. Marinara or alfredo would have been better. Will come again.
15009,Never disappointed
15010,"Very busy, I could not find what I was looking for or a worker to show me where the product was that I could not find"
15011,Clean.
15012,"They will NOT deliver packages, they consistently lie about leaving package slips. I have to track my stuff so I know when I can wait til my day off to go pick up my packages. I actually received a ""final notice"" for a package the other day (a package sent by a loved one so I didn't know it was coming) after not getting any other notices about it. Luckily I have til tomorrow when I'm off to pick it up. I never would have known about it."
15013,"Great service, good was excellent as always!"
15014,"The ribeye was ok, not a lot of flavor.  Wait staff was the best part, friendly and attentive."
15015,Comfortable
15016,Awesome meeting place
15017,"The new place in the Dimond mall was OK, ate there tonight with my kids. The BBQ chicken was good and the sausage pizza was OK, not worth $26 for each 14 inch pizza though. The large was not very large. Was disappointed in the size. Moose Tooth is around same price for 18 inch. However, they did have a clean looking salad bar."
15018,Buy only if necessary.
15019,"Atmosphere was great! Everyone was friendly and made me feel very comfortable.

Terence did an amazing job on my tattoo, and was very patient and open minded.

Thank you guys!"
15020,Watch your tab and check your bank account after a few day's they alter the amount to acquire a bettet payment.
15021,Awesome for the kids!
15022,Best pizza in town.
15023,"Friendly staff, pretty decent beer"
15024,The place looks nice and I was in and out. The baristas were nice as well.
15025,WOWWIE! There is no bakery like this. Awesome bahn mi with the fresh baked bread. 😋
15026,Awesome spicy poke bowl and shave ice.
15027,"Always full of people enjoying good food, companionship and a multitude of beer on tap."
15028,"I just found my new ""Guinness. ""  341 is definitely an acquired taste, its smooth vanilla flavor is followed by a thick bitter Bourbon flavor.  If you enjoy stouts or dark beers give this one a go foso.   It seems more of a stay at home and sip beer than a distillery social drink. Follow me if you like my reviews 🤙🏽"
15029,"Cafe is great, book selection is really nice and the STEM toys for kids are phenomenal."
15030,Very friendly and helpful people
15031,Very interesting
15032,Someone didn't measure the curtains correctly

15037,Awesome
15038,Good food
15039,A nice playground to bring the young people.  Walking paths and restrooms  for public use.
15040,Booked 2 lanes for a make up for league bowling. Didn't honor my reservation and over booked the lanes and made no attempt to inform me before 6:30.
15041,Fairly easy walk in with majestic view to reward.
15042,Quick service and friendly staff. Food was good but a little pricey. Bean sprouts weren't fresh.
15043,I don't have money to buy but I like to walk there and talk to my friends house and I love kids I have see slot of kids
15044,"A great place to plan your visit and get informed. The theater offers various films and it’s all FREE!

15053,Good
15054,Love this place
15055,Close by house n cool stores
15056,"Easy to book and a day that did not disappoint.  We were paired with Captain Joe on the Pacific Sun.  The weather was a little rough and we only had one tide on the day we went out but that didn't deter Joe.  We headed out about 90 minutes and had a successful day of fishing, despite other boats catching lots of sharks and only a few ""overs""."
15057,"excellent attention and very friendly staff, the service was fast and of very good quality and taste, very variable prices but it is worth it to spend a pleasant time with family or friends, I recommend it to go."
15058,"Great cocktsils, super bartender"
15059,Very quick and most of the employees are great.
15060,"the first room on the first floor assigned to us, looked like it wasn't even cleaned! the floor was all dusty, the toilet was full of dirty tissue, bed was ""made"" but looked like it was slept in and the blankets were just folded back and pillows thrown on the bed. the second room on the second floor was much better, but then we were accused of climbing in and out of our window to get in and out of our room to smoke. after the employee who resided there in one of the rooms accused us, he came to our friend who wasn't staying there but there to visit us and said ""I won't say anything about the climbing in and out of your room window if you can help me out and ""hook him up"" when asked what he was talking about, all he said was ""you know"" so our friend ignored him and left. Hours later when he came back, the same employee asked him if he had got what he asked for. When our friend told him ""no"" he said that we should begin packing. Nothing ever happened of it. But to be threatened to leave the hotel we just paid for, is very unprofessional and I would never stay nor recommend anyone to stay at this disgusting ""hotel"" its more like a broke down motel!"
15061,Simply beautiful.
15062,"Best place in town, besides home"
15063,"Right next to Providence Alaska med center, ANMC and Denali OBGyn. The reception is well manned and courteous front desk staff. During COVID, lots of restrictions. The breakfast is limited and you have to pick and select what you want and they hand it to you. The rooms are clean, beds comfy. The toilet and showers are separate. The carpet is definitely older. Have a fridge and microwave in each room. TV channels are basic but also some HBO. There is desk with chair for work."
15064,Love bringing the grandkids here! It is always fun and interesting!! Seeing the kids smile and be excited is pure joy!!

15091,"Helpful staff, resources available"
15092,"Really like this store. Great customer service: I was looking for leg gaiters and called on phone. When I called, the shoe guy went to check that they had them. They did; and when I got there he took me to the area. They had choices in several price ranges. Fabulous. I also liked the Bulletin Board with all the fishing holes, what type of fish, and whether they were open. We'll be back. SW is really more of a  4.5 than a 4.0."
15093,Clean store with unique merchandise
15094,Worst haircut I've received there. After many years I received a bad cut. Waaaaay to short. I spent 20 years in the service.  The haircut I received on the 19 of Jan was shorter than the cuts while I was in the service..

15141,"Well i must say going to get dental work done use to have a certain fear behind it, until today! My 1st time here at bty dental and it was a completly awesome experience.

15149,"Great vehicles, great service!!!!!!"
15150,"Its alright. Nice selection of beers. I had an amber and it wasn't forgettable.  Go with friends. Its kind of dull if you're there on your own. Although, they were grilling pizzas outside as i left. That could have been cool."

15156,The best...
15157,They don't have a place inside of the private bathroom so you can change your baby you have to bring your baby girl into the men's bathroom and change her in there I really don't like that
15158,An Anchorage favorite.  The buffet is yummy and fast
15159,They never have enough cash registers open. Be prepared to stand in line for a minimum of 10 minutes.
15160,Lots of info.  Very knowledgeable staff.
15161,"I have only ever gone there to use the small sled Hill to the left of the lodge. Can't speak to the actual ski hill. It was a great place to stop out for an hour or so and sled with the kids. They didn't have The ski hill open when I went, so they were very low staffed and didn't have much to offer inside the lodge. After sledding we enjoyed some hot cocoa in the lodge and watched the sunset. Pretty good time."
15162,Some times it can be way over crowded
15163,You guys have stepped up your service which saves me time. Much obliged
15164,The food here was amazing! We ordered the pork and we’re so glad we did.  The flavor was incredible.  The views of the city are really pretty as well.  We also enjoyed their warm rolls and other dishes.
15165,The best burgers in Alaska!
15166,"Large storage facility, one of the most advanced multi floor facility's in anchorage Alaska if your looking for a safe heated storage unit with elevator access you found it here."
15167,The associate that helped me may have changed my dog's life! He was suffering from recurring ear infections and I never knew there were OTC solutions that could help prevent them. She helped me pick one out and he's been SO much happier and in less pain since then. I'm incredibly grateful.

15175,"True Alaska experience. Spectacular views of the glacier. On way up we & bunch of other people spotted a black bear up in thar hills.   In June it was not that cold, but we were prepared for anything.

Back in June 2013 I had a car issue at the Visitor Center parking lot.  I waited 6 hours for AAA tow service.   A BIG belated thank you and
* * * * * to National Park Ranger J. Carpenetti who twice in same day assisted me.  No cell service anywhere near the visitors center.  Ranger Carpenetti drove me miles toward the main road to call AAA.  Warning - at that time AAA did not cover Exit Glacier area.  So I had to hire my own tow truck in Seward.  Anyway, big Thanks!  Above and Beyond, real Alaska kindness and saved the day."

15177,Half the staff knows what they are doing
15178,Very friendly staff. Plan on spending a few hours here. Ask before your exam what your plan covers. I was expecting a $20. Co-pay. I didn't know the retina scan was an additional co-pay. I would have skipped it.
15179,Wash and free vac. Why not?
15180,"Not worth your time although this is probably the only one of their clubs even worth glancing at. The administration of the Alska clubs are a bunch of useless money leeches. DO NOT sign up here, or any Alaska Club for that matter. If you want an actual gym check out planet fitness."
15181,"Neat to say hi to Santa, wish they had more of a Toy selection for the kids though. So so so many ornaments though, lots of things for your kids to break so keep them close! This is big tourist trap, not so much for bringing small children too..."

15189,Always excellent food
15190,"We had a great time at Garcia's Cantina & Cafe. The food was good - I loved the Fajitas, and while I wasn't as huge on the pollo fundido, my wife loved it, so I'm chalking that one up to personal tastes. The atmosphere was very upbeat/lively, and lighting to match, and service was great. We were very surprised by how fast our food came out, and the employees were a lot of fun."
15191,Typical dealership
15192,"First time having nails done in Alaska.  The place was clean, nice staff, very helpful when I messed my nails up putting my coat on. They were very nice about fixing my accident."
15193,"Cutting it out, downsizing!"
15194,"This museum is a wonderful addition to the Fairbanks we long to share with tourists.  World-class cars representing so much of the automotive movement that helped propel a gold rush town into the golden heart of Alaska.  The auto collection is extensive and expressive and boldly displayed with period costumes and community spotlights.
All of my guests rave and I keep bring them back for more."

15209,Great people
15210,They can never keep the bathroom clean...
15211,"Really awesome theater.  Prices are Juneau and movie prices so don't be surprised.  You won't hear anything from the other theaters which is nice.   It's also pretty clean and you can get your snacks and ticket very quick.

Wish the people here were different though.  If you go when it's really busy people here are loud and obnoxious.  I don't go when it's busy anymore.  Haven't seen it this bad in any other state."

15221,"Best place to go with consistent day and night time hours, year round, with great food.  Just about everything is good here, from apps and pizza, to wine and dessert. Always have good specials too. The atmosphere and local art is a great addition to the experience as well."
15222,Great food
15223,"Green tea, it's unique and tasty"

15230,I buy feel here and save
15231,I am not able to give you a great response regarding the fairbanks animal control shelter and the main reason is that I have paid for my new puppy to get a rabies vaccine and arrange for it to be done during the day of the rabies vaccine clinic to be held at the pioneer Park area of town. I'm sorry to say that we had a emergency in the family and we weren't able to make the event at pioneer Park. When I contacted the animal control shelter and explained to them that I have the receipt for the payment of my animals vaccine and arrange to have her vaccine given later or at the convince of the shelter and I was told that I would not be able to get my money back and I will have to pay for the vaccine again if I want to get the vaccine and tag for my 🐶... They have claimed that they are a 5013c not for profit and yet they are not willing to give me the vaccine for which I have paid for...??

15268,I recommend Master Auto they provide good quality auto repair very friendly .
15269,"Hoping to rewrite this later, but was disappointed in the service. My husband had been by the lot and found a vehicle that he wanted me to test drive. He had talked with a salesperson prior to us returning.

When we got there we went to the vehicle we wanted to look at, sat there for a bit and no one came out. That was fine.

My husband went in and was told the salesperson he had spoken with was on the phone. He told the front receptionist that we would be waiting outside next to the vehicle when the salesperson became available.

While we waited he texted the salesperson and didn't get a reply. After approximately 30 minutes of waiting we left.

As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot the salesperson called. According to him the message about us waiting wasn't passed on to him. I had the same reason used by another salesperson when I had previously been inquiring about a vehicle on the lot.

Not sure if it's being used as an excuse or the reception isn't doing their job, either way service was lacking."
15270,"They do have some angels that work at this place. Covid makes life difficult with some of the schedule and hours. Thank you for making some miracles happen.

Ps. Can you just update your automated recordings it says you close at 6:00 p.m. due to covid we don't visit the clinic as often. So not everybody knows the new schedule for Chief Andrew Isaac.
You guys keep fighting the good fight. highly educated crew you guys got I sure do appreciate you guys."
15271,Good food nice folks
15272,"The coffee is some of the worst I've had (think Dunkin Donuts at the end of the day), the service had an attitude, the food is middling at best, and the seating is extremely cramped. I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere (there are plenty of other options nearby)."
15273,Food is overpriced for even Alaska seasonal restaurants. The halibut was overcooked.
15274,"Good food, decent price range, friendly and attentive staff, needed a special order and they were able to handle it easily and without a fuss."
15275,The only place for pig chow!
15276,Our favorite sushi place in town. Creative plates and delicious food.

15278,"Pleasantly surprised the selection and fair prices, given the remoteness of this tourist laden town (summer may 15 - Sept. 15)... Friendly staff"
15279,The food was excellent. My wife had the Alaskan cod fish and chips and I had the crab roll. Portions are HUGE. They had live music (Friday Night) and we got there in time to get a good table. The waiter was a bit rude but got better as we ordered more drinks.
15280,"Nice, peaceful"

15290,Excellent voluntary establishment.
15291,"Max at Happy Camper is the best. Happy Camper installed a generator for my 5th wheel, great work. I was so pleased that I have taken my rig back for a slide out repair. No worries here."
15292,Aside from an experience where they let a 3rd party set up a booth to get my information for a sweepstakes in the theater (turned out to be a massive scam for a timeshare!!!) I've always had a great time here.
15293,"The food and the service is always excellent, it's my favorite restaurant in town."
15294,Clean well stocked store..
15295,Pretty place
15296,I am originally from Atlanta Georgia where we have Steak and Shake. These are equivalently yummy 2 those burgers which I absolutely think are the best!  Smashburger is my new favorite burger joint in Anchorage by a long shot. We received good service and the food was fabulous. Please bring a Smashburger to the Kenai Peninsula!
15297,Good steak and reasonably priced drinks. Decor could use an update.

15314,"Helpful staff, great prices, amazing selection. If you need sport stuff come here first."
15315,"Probably one of the worst Burger Kings I have been to. Walked in, there was no one at the counter, I see 7 employees in the back. I place my order then wait almost 15 minutes before my order is up. I look in the back and employees are just standing around.
I start to eat and find that both the fries and the onion rings are stale. I take both back and get a fresh batch, but something was wrong with the rings. My guess is that they haven't changed the oil recently. They were so bad that I didn't eat them."
15316,"Nice clean store, friendly employees. Had my order correct and ready to go no hassles!"
15317,Hands down the best Prime Rib all ways busy.
15318,"No toilet for customers?!
Not very family friendly in my opinion. You have to wait for someone with a key to show up while your kid pees on themselves. And to top it off, no changing table in the bathroom where they take you. So good luck if you have a baby with a diaper blow up while you're doing groceries with children"
15319,They have just about everything you need. Just pre-stage your mind about the prices and you will enjoy the visit.

15334,Love their mango salad dressing!!!!
15335,"Fast and friendly, plus delicious"
15336,Haven't actually spent time in this park but have ridden by it plenty of times on bike. I would recommend accessing it by the South trail if you are on foot or bike. Has a little pond and huge areas with a couple established soccer fields. Nice park.
15337,"Even when all tables plus seats at the bar are filled you can expect to get the friendliest customer service and fastest wait times. The menu is moderately priced. Definitely try some of the yummy appetizers, like my favorite, Loaded Tots. And if you think you have a drink these bartenders never heard of, I bet u don't."
15338,"coming from the valley there's no reason to, unless you're getting bacon and dog food otherwise just go to three bears not much cheaper, you save yourself the trip into Anchorage unless you're feeding the family at 10 there's really nothing you're going to get in Anchorage Costco that you can't get at three bears plus you save yourself the membership fee."
15339,Ok Subway. They put the bare minimum of everything on the sandwiches and into their work.
15340,The food was good! And it was fun to get out of the house.

15346,"The milk shake was really good! The food was was not the best I ever had,  but it was not bad. It was a busy place and the waitress apologized for having slower service.  Not ranking  as a favorite food place. It a place I would eat again."
15347,"Small spot, but great food and friendly staff."
15348,"Took considerable time to be approached by a salesperson.  However, service was helpful."

15357,Stopped by for coffee but ended up eating their delicious maclaren pie with homemade ice cream. Great service and friendly owner.
15358,"Super service by the people at Grant. Pilots and front counter people go the extra distance to help accommodate travels, they even hold flights for their if they can. They have worked with me to help in more than 1 instance. The only way to fly is Grant."
15359,Unique flavors.  Kids love it.
15360,It's ok
15361,don't listen to the whiny female's post above maybe she is a piece of trash - she obviously name calls like a 5 year old

15366,A very classy place to get some grass! Great prices and variety!
15367,And then my co workers had to suffer
15368,"Paul did a wonderful job fixing up our Subaru. Instead of purchasing unnecessary parts automatically, he was able to simply repair what was already there. He was very expedient, and kept me updating with phone calls regarding how the job was going and when parts would arrive. He did his best to keep costs down but not skimp on quality. I was really pleased to find that Paul was exceptionally polite and well mannered. Sometimes auto mechanics can be condescending or brash (looking at you, Mr. Lube), but I found just the opposite. Paul really took the time for wonderful customer service and did a fantastic job."
15369,Sushi is really good here. Haven't tried anything except the sushi yet
15370,A nice place
15371,Always good
15372,Nicest staff. Love the breakfast items and sweet treats. Also happens to have good drinks.
15373,Awesome camping and outdoor recreation
15374,Nice atmosphere and friendly staff
15375,"Great food, great ambiance, great drinks. You can definitely run into waiting for 40 minutes or more and some hostesses are a little less than thrilled to be there.

If you haven't had rockfish, get it here!"
15376,"It's nice to have a store that sells mostly health conscious foods, and their prices are very fair. The store is clean, and there are often empty boxes by the door for packing groceries in."
15377,Good car wash
15378,Fun place to swim and explore. My boy was fascinated by the power plant.
15379,They were great.  Answered all questions to my satisfaction.  Bought a twin mattress set with base and 2 sheet sets.   Might as well buy a cooling pillow while there.  I'm excited that they deliver also.
15380,"Clean, relaxing"
15381,Clean comfortable and affordable friendly helpful staff

15391,Service was very pleasant.  Meal was ok.
15392,Excellent products
15393,"A great moderate to strenuous hike especiallyduringthe winter months...lots of climbing walking, glasading on ice. There are 3 places that have a rope attached to a tree to assist with the hike.  Trails are maintained for about 3 miles...after that highly suggest downloading the url that is provided at one of the stops along the trail.  Remember to bring your ice tracks, gaiters and hiking poles...will make the hike easier."
15394,A quiet place to grab a coffee or a bite to eat at the end of Tudor.
15395,Really good FRESH made Chicken. Always crispy and hot.
15396,Cute little place with great food.
15397,"The BEST fast food. Sometimes things happen, and you need food, if you MUST eat fast food, Wendy's is the best. BEST in taste, freshness, Nutrition and value."
15398,"Great place ,very busy"
15399,Would Customer was great. Room was clean and very spacious.
15400,Great selection of books. Wait time for checking out would be shorter if there was more than two cashier's.
15401,Yum!!
15402,My family and I really enjoyed the walk through the wildlife complex. As an avid hunter I really support their efforts towards the re-establishment of the Wood Bison and Muskoxen into Alaska!
15403,Great food and service. Good people all around.
15404,"FOR TIRES INSTALLATION.

TLDR: I recommend American Tire & Co for tires over Costco. If you have a Costco Tire appointment, plan for a wait for at least 2 hours, if not longer.

Made an appointment for winter tires, special order because they weren't in stock in the store. Made an appointment for 5PM, was out of the store by 840 PM. Even if you make an appointment, plan for at least a 2 hour wait if not longer. There was a group of us in similar situations, all waiting for our tires to be put on. On a positive note, met some friendly people while waiting.

Fast forward a day after. Had a flat while going to work, the  valve stem was defective and leaking air, causing the flat. Had to put spare on, no problem. Drove to Costco at 10AM sharp, guy told me 45min ETA. No problem. Hour of shopping later, they told me it will be 15 minutes until they pull in my car and start working on it, because I was a walk in.

If you want tires, Costco is an option, but I recommend going to American Tire & Auto, which I have done before with no problems. I only went to Costco because I was going to move stateside eventually, so I thought why not. I'm giving 3 stars just because of Emmit, good guy, very helpful."
15405,Ni customer service but product is great
15406,"The table seemed sticky. The wait staff had poor hygiene.  She wiped her mouth and then touched our drinks.  The service was really slow and while they apologized they offered no compensation.  I even heard the waitstaff discuss with each other how to prepare their customers for the wait after they'd been seated.  I felt the food was way over priced. I had the linguine and really thick almost chucky soup.  Limeade was heavy lime and heavy sugar and lacked refreshment.  Too bad we are staying at the park and love it.  And would have likely eaten here again, but I wont go back now."
15407,"Amazing place, very Alaskan."
15408,"They have a Santa. When you get there let the person know how many in party to spend time with Santa. They give you a number so you can look around until they announce your number. Lots of neat Christmas decorations, book, and ornaments. They also have some Pajamas."
15409,It's a Walmart
15410,Tried their new sandwich with onion straws.  Wasnt so good.
15411,Service was great and the camp sites were well situated
15412,Completely wrong order was brought to us. Took an hour and a half to get the correct order.
15413,Great spot to get the outdoor toys for Alaska
15414,Yummy Pizza by the slice on the drunken road to winding down? Game.
15415,This breakfast is over the top. It's expensive but it is worth it.
15416,"First time since the remodel, the new seats were great!"
15417,Ok
15418,I try to get here every time I get to Anchorage. They have always been absolutely great. The last 2 times I stopped to get my rolls they were not so good. I always get a 4 pack to go. I dont usually get to them for several hours. This last time they were very hard and stale. I couldn't even soften them up in the microwave. The sugary cinnamon was very grainy too. Perhaps I will insist on the fresh ones in the future. I have been dissuaded in the past and told that the packaged ones were fresh also. Not this time. The rolls also looked like the goofy misshapen ones that are set aside. I will try one more time...3rd times a charm.
15419,Always love how clean this place is but they need way way more parking
15420,Because
15421,"Everything about this store deserves five stars! The staff, the environment, the menu, the quality!!! Worth the time!"
15422,This is one of my musy visits when icomI  to Anchorage.  I love the mie krob.   I found myself to be full after every meal so unless you are having appetizers. I would not consider it small plates.
15423,Nice race track. Nice view.
15424,Great owners and great food! Definitely best lunch spot!
15425,So glad to be back! Ronnie's serves the BEST sushi and has amazing customer service. Sit at the bar and enjoy a laugh and watch the presentation. I have been coming here since I was 15 and will be coming here until they have to wheel me in! Amazing!
15426,It's Walmart
15427,Great place...
15428,"I've had issues in the past with botched vet care. So when everyone recommended these guys I brought my dogs in for a check-up and later for one of them fixed there. And these guys are amazing, the vet even called the day after to see how my dog was doing. They don't charge an arm and a leg, and are so nice!"
15429,"Beautiful view! Some people trespass the railroad to climb on rocks, though it's not allowed."
15430,Affordable and still comfortable (writing this from bed 8 months later)
15431,Awesome
15432,The pretzels are really good and the employees were great. One employee did take our order and then left but the other two quickly fixed it for us.
15433,Great mexican food
15434,The food has changed. Not nearly as good as it use to be. Service was horrible
15435,"A lot of empty booth space and the ones that were there are the same as every year, which is good for tourists...  but boring for locals when there is nothing new."
15436,A fun and surprisingly delicious place for a burger!
15437,This place gots to be one of the best places to eat for a quick and easy meal. If you’re really into pizza for a quick me and some wings. This place is the spot.
15438,Its my fun place! I enjoy going there whenever I can.
15439,Good food.  Staff is a little loud talking to each other while I was there.  Did not add to the ambiance
15440,"Cheap, good, and dependable"
15441,Best ice cream
15442,"Lollipop pork chop.
This is the dish I order almost everytime I go, perfect everytime."
15443,I like the different shops over there
15444,The burger was so hot and fresh !
15445,Expensive but really tasty. They have a wide variety of homemade ice creams.
15446,A must visit place.
15447,Great food  snd wonderful friendly service
15448,Small.
15449,It's actually mojo to go now. It's fantastic.
15450,Very good ! Great portions on door dash ! Egg drop soup needs a little soy sauce but o my  every thing was packed perfectly for delivery so nothing was soggy  . Food was hot and delicious!
15451,These guys know how to do bar food right! Everything is bomb! Really good Bloody Mary’s too!
15452,They ALWAYS give cold fries. Now i have to check my order at the window and ask for HOT fries EVERY TIME
15453,"Pretty much anything a professional beautician needs is here, but available to the public."
15454,Love love LOVE their Birria Tacos!!
15455,"Great coffee, great prices, great service. Being on base makes it very convenient."
15456,Very good!
15457,"Great food, beer and service. This is a must for anyone traveling the Parks HWY. This has the Alaska motif atmosphere with a fire pit that is constantly burning. The walls are covered with local Alaska history. When we visited, the dining area was at 90% capacity. They wait staff is really on thier game for the amount of patrons.

If you love craft beer, this is your place."
15458,Good options for vegetarians
15459,Awesome burgers no matter the time of day. Best burgers in town.
15460,"Great food, excellent service and friendly staff 👍."
15461,"Great food!! Great prices!! Great service
Will definitely be a repeat customer."
15462,Typical great clips. Great staff at this location. Love how you can check in online.
15463,The staff try to keep the lobby clean and get food out as fast as possible. The drive thru can use some ice scraping during the winter since it's sometimes a pain to drive in. If your looking for a quick bite then this beats McDonald's any day since the food quality is a lot better. I recommend the spicy chicken sandwich with onions if your feeling hungry and want something spicy.
15464,Good place for walk
15465,Free ring cleaning was a nice surprise.
15466,Great coffee
15467,"I remember the good ol days when you could buy a box of Pel's for less than $5. The dumplings were plump and full, the sour cream was thick, and the service was shady. Reggae and jazz were the favorite choices of music for years.
Now, I couldnt tell you what kind of music is playing. The bread is casual, and the box of pels is no longer overflowing with delectable dumplings. Instead, youre lucky if the box is half full. It now costs $7 per box. The sour cream is the same...so I guess thats cool."
15468,Great food and staff is super friendly!
15469,Awesome bugera
15470,Best place to eat ever!
15471,What u expect? It's Target
15472,Very nice selection of brands and shoes for everyone. I think they are great quaility. And the staff is so very friendly. I love he layout of the store too
15473,Nice staff
15474,It's a good place to watch hockey games! Go Nanooks! 😄
15475,"Great food, horrible bathroom. Love their luncheon pizza"
15476,Great dining experience!
15477,"Remote parking, no A/C (got warm), but a very cute small hotel with good service."
15478,"This is a grate place to bring the family for an old fashioned meal in an eclectic dinner, the food is grate and there is so much to take in it's almost overwhelming, it's also in my humble opinion a historic location as it has stood and served local Alaskans for decades! Ps.I can't recomend the chicken fried steak higley enough it's one of the best I've ever had and it's a quiet place for the grandparents to..."
15479,The bestest
15480,Great burgers and shakes on those hot juneau summer days
15481,This is not your average hotel room. Apartments converted into hotel rooms and a one bedroom will sleep four people comfortably with the pull out couch in the living room area. Clean and comfortable with all the amenities of home. You can cook to save some money and there's two grocery stores less than five minutes away. There's also fast food places close if you desire that kind of food.
15482,Great place to shop
15483,Very good carry out pizza.
15484,A beautiful park not to be missed!
15485,Love the coffee here
15486,Very nice place. Just stopped by waiting for bus to Anchorage. Great views off back patio.
15487,"Forever will be known as Alaska Land, buuuuttt it's a very nice place to go for a summer walk"
15488,Big Boys toy store
15489,The sales associates in the store were very helpful.
15490,Nothing there for us today.
15491,Service was fairly quick. Food was delicious.
15492,Best quality customer service experience ever
15493,Not my thing.
15494,Always stop by here to get a banana split whenever I'm on 5th avenue.
15495,"It was a busy, changing casual atmosphere on a Thursday night. Played pool,  a good selection of beers and alcohol for a variety of tastes....and a lot of fun to spend a couple of hours catching up with old friends over a few games of pool"
15496,Clean friendly but taco bell is not a place to go if you want Mexican food.
15497,Dive bar
15498,"Helpful, quick turn around for me."
15499,A place worth a bucket list if you have one.
15500,Goldin arches
15501,They have the best apple sauce cookies.
15502,Best casual dinner spot in Valdez
15503,Great service
15504,"2 stars because for the most part it was ok. Most of the merchandise was not labeled and just clustered together.
The store on the outside looked nice but on the inside was dirty and not well staffed (the staffing is not their fault necessarily)
And I could not find anything worth buying ... I'd reccomend Value Village or the Salvation army (both are 5min away from this store)"
15505,Not my favorite location. The people aren't as friendly as other locations & there's always a excessively long wait in the drive-in.
15506,"A lot of sandwich for little price.  Plenty of special options or go the 'build your own' route.  Either way, if you need a good lunch on the go, this is the place to get it."
15507,Nice little ride and your while in Anchorage Alaska.
15508,Was a very interesting place to visit
15509,"It's about what you expect from any Taco Bell. Not particularly nice nor particularly trashy. The food is quick, service is decent. Lots of high school students, so, good to support someone's first job."
15510,Best friend egg burger in the state. RIP Bookey.
15511,"Clean and staff leave you be, aren't constantly asking if you need anything"
15512,Great customer service!
15513,Awesome
15514,Good fast service
15515,"There's a sign saying WEAR MASKS but NOT one person or kid wears a mask ever in the park since the sign was put up. And every weekend there's groups of over 20.
I only know this because I drive by it every day a few times a day.
I was thinking about taking my family there but forget about it.
My wife & I decided NO when we seen a kid sneeze a few times on the play equipment & it didn't get cleaned up.
Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm not. All I know is I cannot take my kids to a place where NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON PRACTICES SAFE MASKS WEARING LIKE THE SIGN STILL SAYS. I am playing it safe since the CCP coronavirus is mutating constantly."
15516,Fantastic place..it's is very nice
15517,"The staff are amazing..... The dentist did a great job on my teeth... and zero wait time....
Update .... They messed up on my teeth went to another dentist 😑 and found out they started multiple things that did not finish"
15518,Always a Great show. Always great people trying to help.  Its a beautiful venue.
15519,World Food
15520,They seem to help a lot of animals. Mine was not one of them. If you make an appointment do not expect to get to talk to the Veterinarian.
15521,"Smaller resort,, eateries close early,open after 6:00am"
15522,"(Translated by Google) or tha brisket sandwich

lub tha brisket sandwich"
15523,Lame prices even though they are going out of business
15524,"My Oriental Chicken salad was AMAZING! Tortilla soup was Great. My boyfriend ordered a philly cheesesteak sandwich, it was very dry, like a very small amount of cheese on it... AND GRAVY. Like the kind of brown gravy you put on smashed potatoes. The server was absolutely fantastic, she took care of it. She was kind sweet and understanding.  I'm sure we will go back... just wont get the philly."
15525,"We love AJs! Sit at the bar. They have glacier brewhouse IPA on draught and they make a pretty good cocktail. We are never disappointed with the food. Scallops are always cooked to absolute perfection. The onion rings are amazing, crunchy! The burger is the most bang for your buck in Homer."
15526,Some shady people lately
15527,Great staff!
15528,"It's a huge park, all beautiful!"
15529,Love the staff. Love the deals. Love to just brows. Such a fun store.
15530,Wonderful dinner with great service.
15531,Awesome place with wonderful food and people!
15532,Clean but always so pricey. Need bigger sales!
15533,"Great staff, very helpful. When the new site is finished this will be a great stop indeed!"
15534,Great experience..... wonderful and informative staff. Definitely coming back!
15535,"Had lunch on a Sunday. It was okay, but just okay. I had a Ruben panini, and it was on par with hundreds of others I've had. Not bad - on par. The mark downs were due to the somewhat confusing service (counter order, table service, counter pay) which I guess you'd get used to after a few visits. The problem is, there's no real draw for me to come back. We also had a cannoli and it was pretty good."
15536,This food was mostly good if not a little cold but the service was terrible. The decor is great and they had a good amount of staff. It took almost 45 minutes to get our food. They weren't busy but the waitress blamed it on the bar being busy.
15537,Large craft beer selection and good thin crust pizza.
15538,"The visitor center is pretty small for such a big tourist hot spot, the drinking fountains have the nicest filtered water dispenser I have ever seen lol"
15539,"What a great local place! Historic downtown has so many unique, eclectic shops and restaurants that couldn't possibly be replicated. The Bistro adds a perfect gem right in the center, with amazing crepes and various café drinks"
15540,Musicians dream shop
15541,"Food was good for fast food, but there is an employee who's job it is to interrupt you from eating and ask about their service, this wouldn't be a problem if it only took 30 seconds, but it was a good 4 min before she left us alone."
15542,Dirty
15543,"I've only gone to this hardware store twice, and each time it's been out of desparation.  And each time, they've had exactly what I needed, when nobody else in Eagle River did.  Most recently, they had shear pins for snowblowers on a snowy weekend when AIH was all out.  I just need to be more in the habit of stopping here first instead of last.  The service has always been terrific too.  I highly recommend this place for your local hardware needs."
15544,Even at 1030-11ish their 6 piece was very good and fresh.  I dont like coleslaw so they said i can substitute it with an extra sauce. My husband LOVED their coleslaw.  He said its a heck of a lot better than KFC coleslaw. Their fries and garlic bread was good as well. They have the awesome ice too... Hospital ice is what it reminded me of.
15545,Great calzone and good pizza
15546,Love the scones and breakfast sandwiches!
15547,Great friendly service and sales are not too pushy.
15548,Outstanding!
15549,"The staff are quite friendly. Burgers.....oh man I tell ya tough to get like there's anywhere! Had a shake too. Just like a soda fountain was !!!!.
Bring yourself and the family ....then tell ALL your friends. No one will not like this  great joint !!!!"
15550,Friendly staff fair price  and good cut
15551,Excellent food. I had the lunch carnitas with  horchata to drink. Outdoor seating complying with the MOAs new restaurant policy.  Food was timely and the service was great.  I'll be back to try the rest of the menu. Highly recommend!
15552,Love this place! A true toy store. Family owned and operated. Quality made toys for life and learning.
15553,"(Translated by Google) A hotel that knew good days. Past ownership. Price is not justified. Bed linen and towels. Clean. Distance from anywhere

15563,Awesome store
15564,I had an appointment for a tire change over. The prices were reasonable but the best part was the toy table for my 3yo son to play with in the waiting area. They even offered him a fruit snack when we walked in. A+ for customer service!
15565,Great outdoor
15566,Small one but better than nothing
15567,Great discounts and helpful staff.
15568,Went to return an item bought online and the MANAGER on duty said she can’t return it because they don’t carry it in her store.
15569,Good happy hour 9pm to close!

15579,Excellent produce options and a great place to buy meat..
15580,"Used household stuff, super deals. Simple."
15581,"Only get pad Thai when I go out for Thai food. It was not that good. Had large chunks of tofu and was bland for pad Thai. Spring rolls were alright. Price, if it was good, wouldn't be bad"
15582,You can find anything related to arts & crafts here ! But it's a bit expansive.
15583,Food was good and at a relatively cheap price! The food was decently authentic especially compared to the other Asian food in town
15584,Too busy for customer service.
15585,Better to come several times for different purposes.
15586,"Comfortable but due to no fault of their own, loud neighbors fighting."
15587,Great food here
15588,"Great customer service, very friendly staff, clean place, great food"
15589,I love Tesoro gas stations.
15590,"Just ate here again.  Both the Burgers and the fish and chips were great.  Plus, they had Chili Lima Cholula, which...is...AWESOME"
15591,Bomb
15592,Our food came out quick but the people on window sounded like robots. I personally work at a mcdonalds and greeting the customer with positivity really makes the experience
15593,Very kind and helpful.
15594,Very friendly staff.
15595,"I ordered the impossible burger. The burger itself was great! I love that so many places have such a quick and easy vegan burger option now. However, the service was awful. The place was pretty dead, it was a Thursday night, I called beforehand to see if myself and two friends needed reservations and they assured us that we didn't. Regardless, it took nearly 20 minutes for our server to come by and offer us menus. We sat so long without menus or water that another waitress came over and offered to bring us drinks.
The food arrived and my gluten-free bun was moldy. I hate raising a stink at restaurants but after inspecting it under a phone flashlight, it was clear that there were fuzzy green areas on the bun. I mean, I get it. I'm gluten free and I keep all my bread in the freezer bc it goes bad so quickly. Also, I assume gluten-free buns aren't exactly flying off the shelf...
Our waitress swept the burger away, apologizing, but she came back shortly and got in an argument with us, insisting that ""the chef said it was ash off the grill and he has years of experience so I trust him over you guys"". I was flabbergasted. This woman was literally telling us the mold we saw on my food wasn't there and that somehow ash from the grill was instead on my cold, untoasted bun. It was ridiculous! They tried to tell me that they weren't going to replace it, and then they insisted that I keep the burger but they would put it on a new bun. At that point we were all just stunned. They brought a whole new plate within minutes, so I'm not sure what the whole gaslighting discussion about mold vs no mold was, but it was maybe the strangest experience I've had at a restaurant.
Regardless, none of us will ever go back to 49th State. Just awful."
15596,great prices great products are are proven
15597,best chicken katsu
15598,Blacken tenders are awesome.
15599,Food at this TB always makes me sick
15600,"(Translated by Google) A fabulous place .. Wildly wonderful ..

Un lugar fabuloso.. Salvajemente maraviloso.."
15601,& to think I did some of the masonry work out front & they never did anything with that concrete podium thing? Can't complain they payed me. Real 2 Real
15602,Absolute must see if in Anchorage
15603,"Great owners, friendly staff and the best cinnamon buns in town!"
15604,Awesome Asian grocery that accommodates the white folks.
15605,Consistently decent pizza.  They're 2 large pies for <$30 is what we always go for.  My new favorite is the chicken ranch.
15606,"Awesome punctuality! I went to my insurance app and after I requested a tow they called me within 2 minutes. My car was at Walmart, when I got there Midnight Sun was already there within 30 minutes. I had an issue with parking my car at home the driver accommodated my issues with neighbors spot, he got it the best he could which was perfect! Thanks!"
15607,Excellent service
15608,We like them & love that they deliver to the Southside.
15609,Great place for early morning breakfast and friendly and cheerful service. We had the classic breakfast and French toast with a side of eggs over-easy.
15610,Delicious grilled halibut tacos. Portions are large. Very tasty food.
15611,"Love this place, they take good care of the all pups and post adorable pics online for their parents to see❤️"
15612,My uncle is staying here
15613,Very nice service and awesome food. 😀
15614,"Wow.  I am from Arkansas and I am used to southern breakfast cooking.  This was a very refreshing place to eat.  It definitely reminded me of Arkansas or southern foods.  I got the two eggs scrambled, bacon, fried potatoes and biscuits and gravy.  The portion sizes were outstanding. And the prices were very comparable.  The owners of the establishment were extremely friendly and made sure we were taken care of.  I will definitely be back and I am very thankful for a place like this.  Give it a try and I promise you'll love it."
15615,"Excellent idea in the eub-zero tempatures. A drive thru cafe, with an impressive menu choice. The staff are very friendly and efficent. High recommended."
15616,Loved this store - I wish they would go back having 2 to 3 rows of under.
15617,Great selection of parts and helpful staff.
15618,"Pretty good place. I go there once a week. Good food.
However, They recently changed the Pizza recipe to some sort of sweet bread and I dont care for it. Prior to this change I felt this was the best Pizza in the valley. Not the case anymore. I also believe management are a bit too hard on the staff. Good people are hard to find and I have a feeling they might find it challenging to keep good people around. Happy staff makes happy customers."
15619,it's just beautiful
15620,"Love the pizza, diablo sticks and service here."
15621,Quick fast n easy just like I like them.
15622,Very nice
15623,"Amazing collection of Christmas gifts. Lovely place and great staff. If you are visiting Fairbanks, this is a great place to purchase gifts and home decoratives."
15624,Cheap and grate service....1100...688...out
15625,Love country
15626,"Great bakeshop, great farme6rs market there on Wednesdays in the summer."
15627,"Bough Roses valentines day. They looked OK to me. Nothing spectacular but just ok.
The boss said they were dehydrated and dying. They lasted 2 days. On the third they were completely droopy, wilted and ugly.

Not buying flowers here ever!"

15629,Incredible local bakery!
15630,Not bad but I have hard time hearing.
15631,Too pricey
15632,If you need to ship something they can probably do it I just wish there system ran a little faster and smoother like some of there competition.
15633,Ended up staying 10 nights. Wonderful staff and house keeping! Thank you for the wonderful hospitality! 😍
15634,"Fantastic offering of pho, curry, and assorted Vietnamese food"
15635,Couldn't find their location the number was never answered when I called on different occasions and this location on google is incorrect.
15636,The store is clean and the people are normally friendly.
15637,Good food gold show.
15638,Good food. Great service!
15639,"I dont really like this place, just the movies"
15640,"Very small place that is very popular because has the largest Zip rider on the world. Be aware, is consider like that because it has 6 or 7 lines that if you could put them together will be very long. Goes fast as is very entertaining. Something you have to do at least once in your life. Be careful! is a ZIPRIDER not a ZIPLINE!! Do not get confused when buying your excursion tickets if you travel on a cruise ship, because it is very different. Ziprider you are sitting on the rope-basket, zipline you are holding from the cables."
15641,"Best place for Thai curries in Fairbanks. Frequently fairly busy, but the staff is always very friendly and accommodating."
15642,"Fun place, reasonably priced, eagles everywhere, and right next to the fishing hole.  Enjoy this great family location."
15643,Awesome products and service. I never go anywhere else
15644,I needed a pair of jeans.  Had to wait outside for ever.  There was like 4 people in the whole store.  Won't be back.  I'll just learn how to order on Amazon.
15645,"Wouldn't complain even with a 4 hour turnaround on ""express"" service. Definitely coming back when the time comes..."
15646,"Good location for Mendenhall Glacier, updated and clean.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Will take you places in hotel shuttle if you ask.  Comfy bed with lots of pillows.  Pod coffee maker in room, plus refrig and microwave.  Very happy I stayed here."
15647,Worse now that it's merged with ae. In the same room/store. Much less selection which is hard to believe really.
15648,In the world of saloons we have always enjoyed our outings here. Nothing over the top but nothing that makes me cringe.
15649,"Great place! Drive through or walk through, lots of good information on the signs that can easily be read from the car. Love what they're doing for wildlife preservation and reintroduction here on Alaska!"
15650,The parking lot leaves a lot to be desired in the winter.   I  slipped on the ice getting out of my vehicle and hurt my elbow.
15651,"Best wraps on the island. Makes for a lovely lunch on a rainy day. I recommend the Buffalo Blue wrap, and ask for the spicy one if you like a little heat!"
15652,You get your money worth
15653,"Food was good, but the restaurant was just to packed with tables. I am personally not a fan of hearing conversations from three other tables around me while I try to enjoy a dinner with family."
15654,Did a return . Had no problems.
15655,Great service
15656,Very good Santa's helper pizza and Buffalo chicken pizza.  Great beers and very friendly and helpful bartenders! Excellent bear tooth beer and the deckhand is a great ginger beer.
15657,Seems they've closed the main restaurant for a while. The best food in the Turnagain Arm.
15658,Friendly and efficient staff.
15659,"Love this store. Prices, variety, no-hassle on returns, samples, roasted chicken, gas prices, fast n friendly personnel, exec members benefits n more. Parking, however, is tight so be extra careful backing out"
15660,Dannielle@Lens Crafters. Very knowledgeable & Informative. Thanks
15661,The food is incredible! Wait staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. Can't wait to go back.
15662,Monthly coupons are good.
15663,"Nothing great, nothing bad. You know what to expect if you've been to an IHOP before."
15664,"Chicks look better here than at mc.d's drive thru. Oh, the $1.25 sliders are worth it."
15665,I love their food!
15666,"Had a great time, simply beautiful."
15667,"Yakitori sushi house offers awesome sushi and yakitori options. Everything from their rolls, to chicken heart yakitori, to hwe dup bap, it's all delicious! It is a shame that they were the victims of theft/arson. Hopefully they will get back on their feet soon and come back even stronger and better than ever!"
15668,Nice but expensive
15669,"If you dont know where to go for any meal red Robbins is always on point. The staff are friendly, the food is good, and there locations are great with one on either side of town."
15670,Didn't have what I wanted but knew right away
15671,Great meal for the price and fantastic service.
15672,"wish the prices were cheaper, but I like shopping here to support the business. Cheap food isn't always the best food."
15673,Worst Service ever in history USPS can stop offering package delivery and maybe stop mail services and hand that over to FedEx. 0/5 stars USPS needs to just go away already let it go away.
15674,"Older woman employee came hurrying out of the restroom hurried through employee door.  Sure enough, sink dry as a bone.  Never washed her hands.  I came out, a minute later, it was her taking our order.  At least she wasn't handling food.  That I saw anyway.  The meat was dry on my brisket sandwich and both our orders of fries were hard bits and pieces."
15675,"Good food. Though maybe they were short-staffed? Tables needed wiping and they were out of a lot of things. They messed up my order, we had to request more silverware, and when we got some it was dirty and had to ask for more. But outside of the disorganization the salmon street tacos were good, especially with the poblano sauce. You bus your own tables, no one refills water glasses, and you get your own food so the autorequest request for a 15-25% tip seems strange--though nowadays that's a standard thing that's grown out of control. A fun place to eat downtown on a sunny day overall."
15676,Great food and beer selection. Courteous staff. Nice place to hangout and watch the game.
15677,You can learn about the history and the landscape of Alaska.
15678,Nice to see memorial and information about different battles was great to see in person but had problem with the way property was not maintain at all. Brush had grown over alot of the grounds and was unable to see without the tiny signs with arrows pointing to Memorial. Visit was very short due to the infestation of Mosquitoes.
15679,This place deserves 10 stars!!!
15680,I have never seen any subway so stingdy with the veggies. The other subways in town are never that way
15681,No good
15682,Too much
15683,Pretty
15684,"This is not the cleanest store at all anymore, the produce molds in as little as one day after you take it home, everything overpriced compared to the same stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks where they have competition, front end  and overall management is lacking horribly, and the shelves are often bare due to poor ordering. Cant get attached to a product as it wont be there after the tourists leave and for kickers, they dont require or enforce masks wearing in any way, even though it is a local MANDATE!. But hey! It's the only regular grocery store we have so we are told to appreciate because at least we have one! If manager sees complaints online he chastises people and tells them need to come to him instead of publicly stating their opinions ....but nothing ever changes. Giving a 2 to be generous because there are some very good employees there also and want to give them a star at least."
15685,"Second time out, great food and atmosphere. Food was very fresh and quick."
15686,Great variety
15687,"Great staff, clean place. Big 👍👍"
15688,Excellent service
15689,Love the new game cards!
15690,The drunks were at a minimum today
15691,Great help from staff with a dog charm...A1
15692,Had everything I needed help me with what I needed to get done
15693,Beautiful dress for all occasions
15694,this one of the best shops out there
15695,Awesome as always
15696,Produce and meat are tragic.
15697,Great bargain and friendly staff.
15698,Self service gas station with a large convenience store. Is the perfect example of what it is. Prices not bad either.
15699,"This is a great hotel, I don’t like to despite for the rooms but besides that, one of my favorite hotels in anchorage, both of them."
15700,"There was a male employee in there who was incredibly knowledgeable about the products, very friendly, and his make up was on point. People who like what they do or are passionate about what they do are always amazing employees. He was amazing"
15701,DELICIOUS!!!
15702,Hot just yummy
15703,They have a vegetable noodle option for almost every dish. Delicious ❤
15704,"I've been cheating on my local dispensary with these guys. Their prerolls are delish, with great percentages, as well as the rest of their products.  Loving it here 🥰"
15705,Great pizzas.
15706,"Got curry and egg rolls. Everything was sooo tastey, and the staff were wonderful !"
15707,"Went to have lunch at Wendy's today. The manager April was running the register & taking orders. While taking our order she started to correct an employee who was cleaning the counter off of a spilled drink. She was loud and rude,talking down to an employee while dealing with us at the samend time. The while we were paying she continued to yell at the employee and when she said why aren't you responding to me ""Jamie"", he said I didn't think you were talking to me since that's not my name. She then proceeded to tell the employee what ever I want to & you will do what your told. If this is how Wendy's treat their employees infront of customers then we will not be returning to eat with company again."
15708,"Nice, artsy, laid back cafe is an excellent place to stop for a quick bite or a long study session. They have vegan, vegetarian, and carnivore options for breakfast and lunch! Don’t leave without trying a fresh juice!"
15709,"It's not my favorite place to eat, but I think that's just a personal thing because a lot of my friends are huge fans."
15710,"It's a real old-fashioned barbershop, with 4 chairs and 4 barbers on the busy days.  For the price of a cut at a barber college you get an experienced barber to cut your hair.  Conversation is usually pretty good, ranging from duck recipes to oil prices and the local news, and old days stories about the Alyeska Pipeline getting put in.  Hours vary - however, if they have enough people to last till quittin' time, they lock the doors.  No ""Last Minute Larry's"" here!"
15711,Fantastic food and even better service. Also the music is set in one of the most beautiful back drops you could ever imagine. 10/10
15712,"Finally got a chance to try it after years of wanting to. Went during lunch time, it was busy but not too crowded. Very pleasant, clean, relaxing atmosphere. Friendly, efficient service, very nice people - family owned and operated.

Extensive menu of Vietnamese specialties, very fair and affordable pricing for Anchorage. I  hope soon to try several, especially the cold noodle salads.

Today I had the spicy chicken with cashews, which I am told is their most popular order. Boneless chicken thighs and vegetables in a delicate slightly-sweet sauce with sliced fresh jalapeños and cashew halves. Served with white rice, I found it quite delicious, and the serving for me was large enough to take half home for supper - bonus! My companions all seemed to enjoy their choices. I coveted someone's Vietnamese pork chops, another one I almost got today.

I was very happy with my first visit to Ray's and I will make it a point to come back. I highly recommend!"
15713,Great camping place👍😁
15714,"Pretty nice place the main lady who is usually serving is very nice, the food doesn't take too long and it's pretty good."
15715,Great food!
15716,Tiny place but good food.
15717,It’s ok but has gone downhill in the past couple of years. Avoid entirely if you’re eating gluten free.
15718,They had everything but one item I needed and the customer service was nice
15719,Hot and fresh bomb chili
15720,horrible food horrible service
15721,Great service. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Go bruins!!
15722,Very cool place. Some great exhibits.
15723,"Good doughnuts with a twist like bacon doughnuts, you will see tons of delicious pastries here that you will have trouble deciding and what to buy. The only down side is that they seem to be open at random times and have no stable schedule. But, if they are open, be sure to drop on in, grab a coffee and a doughnut, and enjoy it."
15724,Dr. DELEON and STAFF take excellent care of ALL FUR babies
15725,The food was fantastic and the company too
15726,Great food as always!
15727,Very helpful and knowledgeable.  Lots of options and display models.  Highly recommend!
15728,Always great year round for family nights.
15729,"Delicious food !""Wonderful drinks! Great Atmosphere!! Great friends!!"
15730,Rombo loves to eat! He likes variety. .. I have been too busy feeding him tat I haven't had an opportunity to try Guidos food yet. After I do I am certain to rate this restaurant at 4 or 5 stars. Friday nights there is live music
15731,"The food, beer and customer service is top notch, and the movies are cheap, but when you order a pizza they don't really have anyplace to put it down. I have lost a few pizzas because they fall off a table or chair while I am watching my movie. Honestly some tray stands would go a long way."
15732,Went Mothers  Day. Food was very good. Staff was very attentive.
15733,Getting better with age!
15734,New cold brew in great.
15735,Need more to offer.
15736,Great atmosphere! Friendly staff and fantastic drinks! Live music on the weekends is the best.
15737,"Great food, good beer selection and friendly staff. I was visiting friends and we were seated upstairs. About 30 minutes after we sat down the band started and it was WAY too loud to talk. I wish the hostess had asked us if we wanted to sit 5 feet from the band. We would have opted for downstairs."
15738,"It was ok,  Could have been more helpful on finding items or more knowledgeable about items"
15739,"Ambiance is comfortable and very nice for groups, this was my first visit while visiting with family for the holidays.
Must visit if you visit Fairbanks!"
15740,Great motel.
15741,If you're looking for some great food with fresh ingredients this is the place.  And the price is right. Wow just found out about their TACO TUESDAY! tacos are only 1.99 that's a smoking deal for some amazing tacos. Don't miss out on this gem of a location.
15742,Service can improve.
15743,Great place to safely view some Alaskan wildlife...
15744,"Beautiful views, good parking, nice short walks on wheelchair accessible paved areas and short to epic hikes from trailhead. Informative maps and illustrations for learning about the area. Outstanding for locals and travelers. Dry but clean toilet facilities. Close to Anchorage."
15745,"Ate here a few times last year and were not overly impressed, so stopped going. Just tried 907 Alehouse again and it was a vast improvement. The place was super busy on a Tuesday night. Food was great. Tuesdays are $2 taco night ($5 regular price). That is an awesome deal for steak tacos. My wife had the bacon mac, and it was a huge portion. Great selection of beer and a really cool atmosphere. Definitely recommend it now. They also serve brunch for those early football games."
15746,"By far the best paint store in Anchorage, all the guys at rodda know what they're talking about and can hook you up with the best price for the best quality paint! Do not be fooled by Home Depot or Lowe's those paints are garbage!"
15747,Boots that last me almost 3 years and are top quality. Also best customer service arpund.
15748,Very good !!👍👍👍
15749,"Excellent food, and gluten free options!"
15750,"Best taco bell out of the three stores. Fast,friendly, and delicious!"
15751,"Good food, but packed and slow"
15752,Great lil park
15753,"Usually quick, even when crowded, once you get your order in."
15754,Fast hot food! The kids meal hot ham and cheese sandwich was yummy 😋
15755,Great food and service to.
15756,"So much to see! So much to learn! & PUFFINS!!!
Great aquariums, AND hands on exhibits let you touch anemones and sea urchins, starfish and more!
If you have a few extra dollars, the experiences really look like a great time, and very educational.
Like any good aquarium they are helping to rehabilitate many of the animals there, and helping to educate the public on how they can help to preserve the habitat of these beautiful creatures."
15757,"Level sites, clean bathroom s and great showers."
15758,Always professional and I think they love my dog as much as I do.
15759,Ok. Didnt like that I had to pay .80 for a small side of sourcream
15760,This place was the worst
15761,"Love doughnuts, too far away! If one were built in south anchorage more enjoyable!"
15762,The food is ok the staff can be a bit short.
15763,Love their food. They have the best sushi bar
15764,Only food to go..
15765,Great. They even have gluten free options but ask that you call ahead so they can make the batter. We got lucky and they had enough batter for one crepe than my mom and I split but they said they don't always have it on hand.
15766,First time that I have eaten in IHOP. Food was very good. Staff were friendly.
15767,Got to love subway🤤
15768,"The food is good, the staff is friendly. This location is in midtown so don't be surprised if you're approached by a homeless person, I've had a couple homeless people catch me going in or out here."
15769,Pricey.
15770,Never disappointed! Get a custom drink and breakfast bagel 🥯
15771,"Cash Only, walk ins only. Friendly staff who give a good haircut for a good price."
15772,"Great location, good staff and rooms."
15773,"Parking is scarce, the parking garage is smelly. The restrooms aren’t clean, but they have the shops that I like and several Pokestops."
15774,They are very helpful.
15775,It's a Walmart... It has cheap things. Not the nicest Walmart but not the worst either
15776,"Good food, good waitstaff."
15777,I love their weed selection its really nice
15778,Expensive as compared to Amazon.Some items are available on there website but not in store.
15779,Great little place to have lunch or dinner. Their tacos are absolutely delicious
15780,Them fries make me want that shake shake.
15781,Love working for Taco Bell. Great place to work an the people are friendly.
15782,"The South end pulloff is wonderful place to stop and view the picturesque view of the mountain and lake.  In the stillness of early morning, the mirror reflection is too marvelous for words."
15783,Excellent and fast service even for my stranger aggressive puppy. They were so patient with her and did an excellent job making her not stink!
15784,Excellent great food
15785,Bigger than expected!
15786,Has mostly everything your pet needs

Hermosa vista"
15789,Great service from the staff.
15790,Good food
15791,"Once again an unbelievably poor experience They seem to be always training. There are only one or two per shift who have a clue about taking and filling an order. Even when they are not busy they can't get it right. Most of the McDonald's have the same problem, but it is always the worst here. I keep thinking they will improve  but finally realized it won't ever happen."
15792,Best home cooking around. Love the community feeling the place has. Its busy on the morning weekends but worth it! I love the fried rice💜 Added it to my breakfast and crave it often!
15793,its our venue for plays and ballet...
15794,Best soup in town and perfect to warm up with during these chilly winter days 🥣 -thai chicken soup $5 cup
15795,Such a great little hotel. Nothing fancy but really nice rooms and great staff. Favorite place to stay in Homer.
15796,Great Bagel Burger and ice cream!
15797,Not that great. Pizza is on the chucky cheese level. Staff was unprofessional and swearing at each other. But it was fast.
15798,Nice place!!!
15799,"First, one should note that all Nome stores carry inflated prices, due to being off the road system. This store is under the Carrs, Safeway brand, so it should accept your points or coupons. Decent selection, a bit understaffed but I've never had an unpleasant experience shopping here."
15800,Quick service for your gasoline needs
15801,Cheaper than coffee hut and higher quality baked goods.
15802,Food is meh at most but the games are great. Customer service was ok
15803,Fun for all rain or shine!
15804,Never been there either herd they keep people there huh strange
15805,Great menu choices and  decent prices.
15806,Fast and affordable service.
15807,This is a fun little bar with good pizzas.
15808,Always good food with plenty of extra. The staff are excellent.
15809,Best docs with the animals around
15810,Fun and safe place to enjoy for all.  Friday nights are the best as they have the Drag show.
15811,"Sitting outside was nice. Had a wrap the chicken was cold in side. And a lot of lettuce..
A Heated chicken would have  had a better taste . Maybe there idea of a warp.."
15812,Excellent place to stay
15813,"We have been using Specialized Import for years. I have been told I can get cheaper elsewhere. My reply is always, ""I don't care.""  They light heartedly fix my non mechanical self's screwups and repeatedly give me less expensive options or tell me what I thought was needed was not. They could have easily taken advantage of my family countless times and have not. Work has always been good. Trustworthy and good - a recipe for my loyalty."

15819,"Inventory was kinda lacking, people were kinda scarce also."
15820,Great place
15821,Last time I visited my meal was over cooked and they removed it from my bill without hesitation. Very good customer service. The picture below is of the meal that was prepared correctly during that visit.
15822,Great food. Pizza has the perfect crust. From the very first bite there is amazing flavor that instantly satisfies your taste buds. The Greek vinaigrette dressing was also wonderful. Staff is great and food is ready for pick up when they say it will be.
15823,Much good varieties of food there. Very good place to go
15824,"Good food at good prices, got take out and was ready when I walked in, I didn't have to wait. The serving size is abundant and the hand cut fries  and grilled chicken are fantastic."

15834,"The burgers and sides (fries, mozz sticks, onion rings)  are great. Have eaten here 3 times and have never gotten bad food. This is a permanently located food truck. Literally an old school bus with a wooden lean-to built on the side. Seating is on multiple picnic tables (3 exposed, 1 under cover in the lean-to). Food prep takes about 15 minutes, depending on what's ordered. Longer at busy times. The burgers come with ""fixins"": mayo, crisp lettuce, nice tomato slice and sweet pickles. They are not fancy burgers but they are very tasty: squishy sesame seed bun, well melted cheese, great flavor. Highly recommended!"
15835,"I go every year, such a variety of good food"
15836,They got you covered
15837,"Incredibly relaxing, beautifully designed, and fantastic tea. Would recommend to anyone"
15838,"They apparently don't understand what ""no dairy"" means and will still put dairy on my food for fresco and no dairy orders. I'm vegan and extremely lactose intolerant. So frustrating and painful."
15839,Breakfast of champions!
15840,They have it all. Store was clean and the staff was awesome.
15841,Poor customer service. Poor selection. Not impressed.
15842,I’ve never had food poisoning so badly in my life. Got breakfast before my sons field trip and within 4 hours I was bedridden for 48 hours. I have never heaved that way in my entire life. Will not go back to this location.

15855,"I love Carl's Jr fast food restaurant. The food is always fresh, cooked well and very tasty. I am only dissatisfied with the price. They're overpriced for the food. A specialty Burger for almost $8.00, this is outrageous. I can buy a chicken to feed a whole family for that price. So for that reason I am going back to McDonald's when I can get a meal for that price. This is still a good place to eat, just to expensive and I am residing on a retirement budget. Thank you"
15856,"Several empty spots, but i went for the top shelf market and picked up some kraut and keto cookie bites. Yum!"

I heard several ribs out, a shoulder that had been hurting for over 8 months,  a knee that was giving out. Within a few WEEKS I was almost pain free and now I am.  I hiked up baldy,  went halibut fishing and heading Caribou hunting!!!! This is an amazing place for chiropractic care and therapeutic massage."

We first visited Orca Point Lodge and had a wonderful, fresh salmon meal, the spent a few hours spotting and photographing whales, seal, sea lions, sea otter and much more. We were lucky enough to witness multiple whale tails. We were close enough to hear them blow. This was a wonderful experience. The staff was wonderful, friendly and courteous. You could tell that they love what they do. They are knowledgeable on the area and wildlife. This was well worth the money and the time."

It is clean but treated like cattle."
15909,Bean and cheese burritos had onion chunks in them! Asked about onions and was told there werent any... Im allergic to onions and live in Valdez so it was a loooong 6 hour ride without eating for me! Bought the huge box of em too which I get to take home ...wasted over 15 bucks :*(

15915,"I was charged multiple times for the same stay. I was told I was nlt allowed topay cash, so they charged my card 5 times or more. The end result is that I have to wait 5 to 7 business days for my money to reappear in my account over an issue that the Hampton Inn employees did themselves. Ice maker on the 3rd floor was not working and leaking all over the floor. I think this could have been a great stay, but getting charged like this just ruined the whole trip, considering how expensive it was and that it wasn't my fault or my banks fault that this happened. At least a free night would have made the trip almost worth it. But the Hampton Inn employees made no effort to make up for their mistakes, while I am basically screwed til I get refunded for the multiple extra times they charged me flr the same stay. Do not pay online with this hotel. Pay in person and I think you'll be fine."

Has a boardwalk that goes along river and you can fish, at certain parts of year though. Can be a place where teens go and play, so... if it is, id consider going to a different park. Well, have a good day!👋"

15947,"The last full-service station in town, that I know of. The original owners retired, the new owners are doing a fine job keeping up with the tradition. Gas prices are competitive, use your Carrs rewards. They have lane attendants who will actually pump your gas, check oil and other fluids, clean your windshield and check your tires. Propane if you need it. Full service garage, friends and I have had repairs and regular maintenance done, and we're happy. They generally get you in quick, time estimates are pretty reliable, work is good and prices are fair. Convenient location. Friendly and professional. There might be a better service station in town, but I haven't seen it."
15948,My mother and I came in to have our hair done. Mine was an overall color which barely covered my grays. It washed out quickly and my mother's hair didn't get color matched like she needed so we paid $250 for nothing😕 I will try elsewhere.

15958,"I have mixed feelings on this place. For the positive, I’d have to say the pedicure foot massage was beyond amazing. I would have paid just for the massage. They really work on your feet and my feet were really stressed when I went in. Also very nice staff. On the negative side, I got shellac  nails and they are chipping in day two. I also got white tips on my toes and the whole toe is chipping. If they used better product, I would have zero complaint. I can’t rationalize going back no matter how good the massage is if the product chips when it is supposed to last a week minimum."
15959,Great place
15960,Best pizza and salad bar in Anchorage!
15961,"Nice gas station with laundry and bathrooms. We were also very pleasantly surprised that they have hot, fresh food from a little cafe within. You can dine in or carry out and the food is really good and very affordable. We were very pleasantly surprised. The staff is also very friendly and provide amazing service. Both the cashier and chef went above and beyond to help us. There is also a small liquor or beer store with a separate entrance if you want to purchase some libations for your trip. Do yourself a favor and stop here to gas up and get lunch. You will not be disappointed."
15962,They got that good ice lol and awesome dipping sauce
15963,"Very nice folks here. One of my favorite Pizza places. We've been ordering pizza here for years. The crust is sweet and soft (when its not overdone, which does happen occasionally but not a bother for my family).  We live within walking distance and they've got some decent specials for pickup only. No need to go outside of the Butte for dinner. Butte Pizza has you covered."
15964,This can be a rough place to go to. Some of the customers can be very negative.
15965,The team at Alaska Sales and Service are pretty good at what they do. Although they are not perfect they are always willing to do what is right by the customer.  Most of thge time they will go out of their way to make your visit pleasant and enjoyable.  Staff is very freindly and easy to deal with. Moved over here after experiencing multiple issues with the Other Guy in town and have been very satisfied with both the Sales team and especially the Service department.  Highly recommend you give them atry if your having issues on the South side of Anchorage taking care of your heart beat of America vehicle.
15966,"Can't ever seem to find a good deal, may just come on the wrong days."

15982,Great plan of care
15983,"Ordered the crab hollandaise for breakfast. It was terrible, there was hardly any crab at all, just filler. The hollandaise sauce was blah and the eggs were okay. The only redeeming part of the meal was the potatoes."
15984,"Delicious food! Hungarian mushroom soup is the best!! Love the ""Matanuska"" and the ""BLTA"". Cozy atmosphere. Love this place!!"
15985,Literally nothing there besides amazing views and a natural spring down the road a but for free water
15986,Great Customer Service!
15987,Great little shop with a bunch of different flowers in their large garden. Great place to have breakfast or lunch with friends or family. Welcoming atmosphere with a large variety of food. Don't let the fact that it's out of the way or small fool you. The food is worth the trip and the decor will amaze anyone who enjoys flowers.

16018,absolute bomb

16032,"In spring and summer you can see the salmon from upclose. There is lots of other wildlife, some more easy to spot than others. For the past 3 years an eagle pair has been raising their brood from a nest visible from the viewing platform. It can be very windy, so take some warm clothes. There is always something to see so highly recommend."
16033,"Really nice hike. About a mile one way. For the more fit there is a trail that goes down to the falls. You can stay the high trail that has two viewing platforms. One of the Gulch with a great view of the river and another looking out the falls from above.
Gorgeous flora, pet friendly. Dogs must be on leash.
Restrooms located at beginning of trailhead."

Thanks for the courtesy y’all! :)"

16037,Lots of selections and friendly employees to answer questions.
16038,It's a nice place and it said to see so many businesses with their doors closed because of the Scamdemic.
16039,The food I got was decent. Probably top five Asian restaurant in town but it's so dang expensive!!! Service is OK too.
16040,I ran in for a quick Burger and it smelled like rancid mushrooms in there. I walked out with a single burger and ate it wondering why it was so salty until I took a bite of something that tasted just like that pungent smell. I about puked.
16041,Great prices
16042,A newer strip mall with stores coming and going
16043,"They were out of onions and milkshakes. Burger wasn’t juicy, fries were soggy, the music is blaring making it almost impossible to order. We may try again in 6 months to see if they have things figured out by then."
16044,Don't go there at night. Very slow only one Lane open and clerk is usually slow. Customer Service??? Does not have any.
16045,"I like Pad Thai, the portion size was way more than I could finish, so I got to take some with me to work.

The place looks like a little house and not a restaurant, but trust me when I say this is a diamond in the rough."
16046,"Generally a good place for a cheap slice, but this time around I ordered a $10 pepperoni pizza. I was told it would take 15 min, so I waited in my car till then. Once I came back in they had completely forgotten that I had even ordered anything. Then they tried to sell me someone else's pizza for additional $5 more, and it wasn't even what I had ordered. I had to re-tell them my order, and I had to wait an additional 30 min just for a standard pepperoni pizza. Note, I was the only person physically in the store at the time."
16047,Always busy...miss Sam's
16048,Mongolian beef was dry and nasty  tasting. The tea was nasty.  I didn't feel well at all the whole time after. Went down hill from last year.

16059,"Ordering 7 meals and after everything i said i got ""Anything else?!"" which was quite annoying, then she screamed ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!"" (horsing around with coworkers) couldn't be bothered to listen to me for longer than 2 seconds when I'm trying to place my huge order, it took so long to order someone 2 cars behind us screamed out his car and backed out and left. Frustrating experience from a usually good location."
16060,Awesome food and service
16061,I Love there fries
16062,Great biscuits and gravy for the price
16063,huge gift shop
16064,We have been going here for years. Never had a donut that I would not finish. Coffee here is good too. But don't forget the ice cream. They have it all.
16065,"The crepe was huge! The roast duck was delicious! There's two different duck, roast duck and peking duck. You can get the roast duck any time but peking duck you need to order 1 day ahead. I recommend trying both! If you dine in you'll be using plastic utensils and paper plate, not a fan so next time I'll be ordering my duck to go. Service was excellent!"
16066,The bagels are delicious and they always put a lot of cream cheese.
16067,"It is a Best Buy...what can you say.  It's a big box electronics store.  Most of the employees are friendly, and as helpful as they are knowledgeable.  :-)
I do have to say they price match without even batting an eye, which is refreshing.  Well as long as it is a big online (like Amazon/Best Buy) or local place."
16068,My main Store I use
16069,Loved learning more about dog sledding!
16070,It's the only store in Prudhoe Bay Alaska! They have a great selection friendly people and pricing is as high as you'd expect it to be.

16072,"I have visited this store many times over the last 15 years and never once was I disappointed. Great service, great inventory, acceptable pricing. I intend to continue to shop here for many years to come.

P.S.   Thank you for recognizing our veterans with the parking spaces and for flying our nation's flag."

16076,"Good food, service and reasonable price."
16077,"Great service, delicious food!"
16078,"I would definitely recommend Ronnie 2 for sushi. I really enjoy their menu options and their unique sushi creations. They have options for all taste palates and appetites. Plus, perhaps most importantly for a sushi restaurant, the fish is always super fresh and tasty. My only criticism is that they are a bit inconsistent with availability of my favorite roll, the Philadelphia Roll. But other then that, I have had only great experiences with the staff and food."
16079,Always delicious and well prepared food. Stellar customer service
16080,"Awesome cuts. Clean and dependable every time. They're really good at fitting you in when you need to. Pretty flexible hours for a barber shop. Good atmosphere and everyone is always happy, laughing, and friendly."

16082,Funny and entertaining
16083,"I don't normally like Mexican food, but this was okay and they deliver. They're also reasonably priced. 12 bucks for like 2 pounds of food. Nice, cheep, filling. Also fast delivery!"

16091,Great beer selection!!!
16092,"Great place to take the family or just a couples retreat. The food and drinks are great (little pricey but hey what to you expect from being out in the middle of nowhere). They have a bunch of things to do in the summer and winter months such as horseback riding, snow matching, and northern lights watching just to name a few. The hots spring itself is very enjoyable regardless of the time of year, but middle of winter is my wife and my favorite."
16093,Store employees helped me find everything I needed

The birds have begun to arrive for the nesting season. The hunters are out enjoying their time. The greens are beginning to grow. It was awesome, as usual."

16135,I wasn't planning on eating but the beer selection persuaded me; I was not disappointed one bit with the pretzel and beer cheese. I may have blown my low carb diet but it was worth it. What made the experience was the customer service. I suggest sitting in Mark's section if the option is available but all the servers were happy and smiling.

16202,Good place for beginners in fitness to try.
16203,Great place. Lots of safety supplies. They offer a lot of different classes like CPR/ First aid. They also rent supplies if you need them. They can put together very nice first aid kits for your work or job site as well.
16204,"Horrible. I’ve tried 4 out of the 6 bays at this location, and same result every time. The wash doesn’t do anything at all. I talked to one of the on sight employees and showed them that my vehicle wasn’t even washed at all and they offered me a free wash. What good is a free wash if it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do? This is the second Alaska Laser Wash location I’v tried thinking that maybe the other location was just a poor quality facility and figured I’d give them an honest chance. I took this photo about 10 min after the wash. The only clean spots are where my hands open and close the door......LMAO

Response from the owner 9 hours ago
Keyser, I am sorry to hear that you have been having such a difficult time getting your vehicle washed. I suspect what has occurred is that you, for whatever reason, didn't get a good wash the first time you went through, but the finish products worked great - and encapsulated the dirt behind a protective layer. This happens from time to time, but not that often. The solution is to use one of the pre-scrub brushes to remove the Weather Guard and Carnauba Wax and then re-wash. I generally do this myself for my customers who come to the Lake Otis location and have this issue. If you would rather not have a brush touch your vehicle, then one or two of the $10 washes (which don't have finish products) will remove them finish allowing the dirt and grime behind the protective layers to be removed. I know this seems like a lot of work, but it isn't. Please stop by one of our locations and have an attendant help you.

Looking at the photo you posted I have to wonder how long it has been since you washed your vehicle...

Reply to the owners response:
Thanks for the response, but there are a few problems with it. I went to your wash on 4 different occasions over a 2 week period and never saw anyone “pre scrubbing”. The allure to this type of wash is the fact that it’s touchless. There are plenty of spray and wash facilities that I can go to if I wanted to use a brush. If I’m paying for an automated wash that I have to get out and pre scrub with a brush it kind of defeats the purpose. Also you apparently did not read my full review. That picture was taken no more than 10 minutes after the wash was completed."
16205,"Good, off standard menu. Breakfast to dinner. Not a steakhouse. Very good soups and salads, which I wanted. Lots of baked foods. The bread was excelent. Quiches. Casual, and comfy. Lots of expresso drinks. Desserts. Not cheap, but fair and Good"
16206,Great food and service. Will come again another time to try the beer
16207,All I learned from my visit is that if you are a veteran and have the audacity to ask if they offer a discount you will be given a blatantly rude response. I can tolerate alot of short comings in service but I can't help but wonder if it is Starbucks policy to hate our servicemen and women. I caution service members and veterans to avoid this store.
16208,"Very well organized but gloomy. Nice shuttle buses. Overpriced packed lunch, but mostly our room's only window was on a lower floor with a lot of foot traffic in front forcing us to keep the curtains closed"
16209,Always a pleasure to browse the book collection in B&N. I love science fiction and there is always a large selection

16218,Great service and food today
16219,"We decided to go on a short notice fishing trip. Homer Ocean Charters got us on a boat. With Captian Nick and Russ, they were great. They worked hard to get everyone limits. And were helpful and friendly. It was a perfect day.... Other than the wind that blew is of the big water. Didn't matter it was a great day! Highly recommend Capt Nick and Russ. Thanks for all the hard work!"
16220,Oldest coffee roaster in town. Well deserved reputation for excellent coffee and service. This espresso well worth the effort. Covid safe with curbside and in store service. Enjoy =)

16223,Good food for the price
16224,"Everyone were extremely friendly and helpful. Sergey was especially helpful and when i bought my Kia Rio, i never felt like i was being taken advantage of.
I will recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a vehicle,whether it be new, used or certified."
16225,Great
16226,We went to Alyeska for the Oktoberfest. The food was great and the atmosphere was fun with live music. It was very expensive for what you got though and after we got our food we had to wait 20 minutes for seating outside in a cold tent. It was really crowded. Probably won't go again.
16227,"Well my time was short this time I visited but nice mall and clean...I just don't like when the kiosk ppl keep at you as sometimes were just truly short on time and need to seriously shop especially when we are in from Fairbanks or village etc.. otherwise I can only complain I didn't have enough time to spend there or as much $$ as I'd of went home much happier to get all things for myself and my family...great to have more choices in one place and not look like everyone else in town when have limited access to stores as many people still love to go, look, try things new etc as not all of us like things shipped to you untried on or unable to see or feel..."
16228,Did not like at all!
16229,What a great way to spend an evening with your family.  The Spirit felt in the temple while with my family was beautiful. If you are visiting Alaska and Anchorage area in particular don't miss the opportunity to go to the temple. Call first because the hours of operation are limited
16230,"Good food but the service SUCKS. We went a couple of times. The first time the service was a bit slower than expected, however we gave them the time because they just opened. The second time it was even slower service. The last time we waited for almost 2 hours to get our food. We left before we got it because we were so hungry. However the service men that came about an hour after us got a lot of attention from the server. She was over at their table most of the time flirting."
16231,Good late night food place.
16232,"The food was pretty good. I won't say amazing but really good. I'd definitely go back. Kind of diner food, which I love. Their grits are made w water so if you're southern I'd pass. Overall I liked this place. Excellent service"
16233,OK getting smaller
16234,Good food Nice staff
16235,"One of the times my family and I went (before covid) when we got our order, we were missing a cheeseburger. I brought the receipt to the cashier and one of the supervisors said from the back ""all of these orders and we are worried about 1 cheeseburger""? HUM YES, I ORDERED AND PAID FOR IT AND DIDN'T GET IT!"
16236,Always a great place for food And drinks
16237,"Whole family, whole body! This is the place to go. They don't just adjust you and ignore the underlying issues as some chiropractors may do. They assess your whole body starting with the skeletal system (yes, x-rays of your spine is first step, as it should be). Then they build you customized exercises and home care programs so that you can actually work on the muscles and structures to get you back into alignment and not just rely on the adjustments. They contact your insurance and tell you from the beginning what to expect for cost. You are welcome to bring your kids which is so helpful for actually being able to keep your appointments. The whole staff is great!"
16238,"Delicious breakfast burrito, if you wake up early and need something to hold you over, they will hook you up. I'm still full from my AK burrito this afternoon, and I ate 9:30"
16239,This place is Great!!!

16241,Great smoothies
16242,Things have really changed there. They have a great showroom now. Very inviting.

16244,"Always something crazy going on, good location, hang with the locals."
16245,"used to be the best prime rib in town.   now the meat is not consistent any more, kinda hit or miss.  the miner cut used to be a brotosaurus, but isn't that much bigger than the turtle cut these days."
16246,"Dr Nick and his staff are wonderful! They are especially kind and patient, and explain everything they  are doing, to our special needs son. I would highly recommend them! 😃😃👍🏻👍🏻"
16247,Always a good burger & fries!
16248,Awesome

16258,A lil pricey but a great selection.
16259,Always helpful and easy to talk to.
16260,"I really like the chairs, here, and wished I'd taken pictures. This is definitely the best Mexican food in town. Any other Mexican restaurant, you might as well just go to Taco Bell. Super polite and focused staff."

16262,"Buying the vehicle was great, once they received their money though the customer service was gone. During the sale I had mentioned that I would like to upgrade my rims from the 18"" to the 20"" rims. He said it would not be a problem and that he would see if it his boss would offer me some sort of trade in for the wheels that were currently on there. He said, if not worst case scenario he would give me his cost on the wheels. I was leaving town so I bought the vehicle and left my vehicle with them for over a week and a half to get it sorted out only for the salesmen to quit answering his phone and passing me off to someone who has no idea what im talking about or our previous discussion. Still have not got a response after over 15 attempts of trying to get in touch with the original salesmen.  Finally went and picked up my truck only to see they had not done anything to it and couldn't find the keys."
16263,Jc Penny's has tons of great clothes but they are also in a big store so u get confused alot
16264,Tourist trap
16265,"This is the most amazing bakery in the state. I'm a loyal customer, there every single weekend for fresh baguettes without ever skipping a beat."

16274,Great for a quick bite offers healthy choices
16275,Excellent ceviche and other Mexican food
16276,"Best cafe I've ever been to. Prices are good, the food is along the lines of Himalayan comfort food. It gets me out of my comfort zone by assuring that everything will taste amazing! The hot chai is a must."
16277,"Great food, wish they had a bar"
16278,"Weird shopping today, I was 1/2 done & went to the restroom & someone stole my cart with my stuff in it. I had to start over and hopefully I remembered everything. Why do people take your cart? It couldn't be what they came in to get. Anyway we live 4 hours away from this store so it was very frustrating."
16279,Another cool sporting goods store with the standard stuff. Decent prices. Customers service at the firearms counter was great. Not much help at the marine section though. No one really would help me to much when it came to boat related questions and the help I received wasn’t helpful.
16280,Love the pizza here!
16281,I always feel welcome at Denali. The rangers are experts and very friendly.
16282,Absolutely beautiful wooden bowls
16283,"If you choose to come here, just know it's always going to be packed. Even if you're picking up, expect to wait. Now, these folks must know something I don't, as the food here is really mediocre. It's consistently mediocre at least, so you always know what you're getting."
16284,"Loved the pizza it was super delicious and cooked to perfection. Also iy was cheap, less then a 20 dollar bill"
16285,was great experience
16286,Best place to view Denali
16287,Lots of options to choose from. Seems a little pricey.
16288,Awesome blowing things up :)
16289,Always a great place to stop. Just about anything you could need for the outdoors in one place
16290,"Has nice fire pits, and level ground for tents. Overall a good place to camp with a great view"
16291,Much better than mudbusters. More drying time!! A much better value!!
16292,"Love this place, great people."
16293,Always fast friendly service and the pizza is made in front of you. The beer selection is amazing and it's always a fun friendly experience. It's a great place for the family or just friends.

16296,"Super clean, friendly servers, and a great menu"
16297,The mining is great they have a guy working there knows how to mine gold
16298,Loved the old dresses.
16299,Still love to open and scan a book before I but it.
16300,Excellent selection of warm weather work gear.
16301,Had beer that we had not seen at the other stores.
16302,Absolutely loved everything about this place! I got a deep tissue massage and eyebrow wax!  I recommend to everyone!
16303,"So many burgers,my favorite is the Halibut Burger!!"
16304,The new Latin items are really good. Original menu items are still good too. Atmosphere is pleasant. Seems like it will be be festive in the evenings.
16305,I love that park. During summer time it has amazing flowers. You can go and hang out there. During the winter it has lots of events too.
16306,Wonderful place for dogs and children and of course the adults...
16307,They can help answer any questions. Very knowledgeable
16308,Always wonderful.
16309,"Good food reasonable prices , nice atmosphere ."
16310,Great hair cut wonderful staff
16311,"I'd give them 0 stars if I could.  I was looking for something that the app said they had 7 of in stock.  It didn't have an aisle or bay listed for it's location.  I asked 2 people, a younger gentleman and an older blonde lady.  They looked it up on their handheld scanner and then acted as if I didn't even exist.  They started wandering around i thought looking for the part but that was not the case.  2 minutes go by and they're both nowhere to be found.  Without saying a single word to me.  They vanished.  I expressed my disgust by putting all the other items I was going to purchase back and left the store. Upon leaving I saw the blonde lady helping someone else on the computer.  Not a single word did she say to me.  I will never return to this store.  I considered returning to say something to the managers, i'm willing to bet that the managers don't care which is why this behavior exists in the first place.  I've had better customer service with TSA.

I went to the one on Penland Parkway and the whole attitude of the store was different.  People were friendly and helpful."
16312,is way overpriced and not so clean.  for that price you would think they would take care of the roads.  i felt like i needed a prerunner just to make it to a camp spot if it's not sold out first.
16313,Love there riding gear
16314,Yummy
16315,Good breakfast. Fast. Hardly no wait.
16316,Local bar hangout
16317,Great hometown spot; always the go to before the big stores
16318,"Great place, very fun, staff is helpful."
16319,Tacos tacos tacos tacos tacos Tuesday! Me and my family love when we’re having a busy day and I’m not ready to cook dinner for everybody and we run down to Taco Bell pick up one or two of the value boxes and it’s just a great value yummy food it’s always fast everyone’s happy and it makes for easy night. Who doesn’t love Taco Bell granted once in a while you get a bad cashier but otherwise it’s tacos what’s the problem.
16320,"Best lounge in Seward (maybe all Alaska) to watch Sunday football games. Great beer, friendly service, hopeful fans (even if some are Vikings), and usually a free hot lunch!

Photo is an impressive raptor just down the road from Tony's, unwilling to share her lunch with me - ""Get your own."""
16321,Okay.
16322,Rooms had a distinctive unpleasant odor noted.
16323,"Best place to stop in Healy!  They have literally everything there. Stuff you don't even see in Anchorage.  Specialty items.  They carry food items, I've never seen. Their beauty department rivals Target and Walgreens together for specialty items and don't even get me started on all the beers they carry.  Their adult beverages in general offers a pretty amazing and extensive selection. I made some ""special coffee"" while I was standing in the freezing wind of the car show. Coffee and the small containers of Baileys & Fireball. ✔ Here's a tip: if there's a long line in the convenience store, you can bring your goodies over to the liquor store and they'll check you out there. ❤ Love this place!"
16324,Great place.
16325,"I ask for well done burger, was still little pink."
16326,Best hotel
16327,Great fast service the hostess even went around and brought everyone mints
16328,"I went there to get a system put in and windows tinted. So you are supposed to have your windows up 3 to 4 days after to prevent bubbling each time I kept them up a week at least. The 3rd time I had to take my car back to fix the tint because it wasn't put on properly. It kept rolling up and there's a lot of bubbles on 3 out of 4 windows.  Not only that but when they hooked up my sub and amp when I turn my ignition off my sub cuts off but not my stereo. .. almost blew my car speakers . The guy is never there , doesn't know what he's doing and things came missing out of my car when I got it back."
16329,"We took a float plane to Brooks Camp at Katmai National Park and Preserve and had a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We saw a mama bear with 3 cubs before we even left the building that you watch the educational video and get some training from rangers. Once we got to the viewing platforms, it was amazing and an unforgettable experience. It’s not cheap to get there, but this is you stereotypical Alaskan “bears catching salmon” scene that’s everyone sees. We were lucky to go at the right time since the bears aren’t always as plentiful, but what a neat experience getting to get that close to these majestic creatures and not fearing for your life. These bears are used to humans and focused on fish, but the rangers do an excellent job ensuring everyone’s safety. Highly recommended!"
16330,Good price with the discount but it is not unusual for a pump to not function.
16331,They were closing and sold me the wrong thing to get me out of the store.
16332,Great staff.Great sandwiches.
16333,"Worst muscle in some crazy sauce, I've ever had."
16334,Not a skier? That should not stop you from visiting this amazing resort. The tram to the near top was quick and safe. There are many trails one can take from there to cover the mountain. Spectacular views!!! The lodge is a four to five star hotel. Staff was friendly and very accommodating. Highly recommend.
16335,I like the manager at the store I go to. She is very knowledgeable and always has a smile on.
16336,"Decent place, but no wifi so bring your own wifi router."
16337,"Great place to stay. Staff very friendly.
This place still has that new hotel smell."
16338,Great place to take your loved pets!
16339,Great car wash but the crew is 50/50 with their attitude.
16340,"Fast service, good good. Quiet and clean."
16341,they are always having supply problems
16342,"Awesome place with great food. Simple, good potions, easy on the wallet, and for those of you this matters to they use real whole eggs and not the liquid bag stuff. Real quality cheese and a soft tortilla. No where else can cure a hunger for under $8 (most burritos anyway) Support locals and a guy who cares what people think of his food."
16343,They have great food. It's hard to find a decent place to eat at a decent price in Alaska
16344,Love the Caribbean salad!
16345,"Need to go at low tide, but fun searching the rocks."
16346,Bought some fire works and the lady gave my 2 kids a couple sprinklers for free
16347,NICE
16348,Of you don't like it they'll make it right
16349,Great shop run by great people.
16350,Wonderful staff. Fresh buns!
16351,No WiBurger. Burger couldn't connect to BurgerTube.
16352,Great crew.   Positive experience.  Great location...
16353,the self service machine i was used to feeding cash was made credit only i was in a hurry and had cash the lady was more than happy to help me move it to the one next to it that took cash scanned my item and i was good to go
16354,The food was very poor quality but service was worse!! The food was dropped off and then our waiter never came back but walked past us making sure not to make eye contact several times. I know he could see I wasn't happy because I hadn't hardly touched my food and as far as he was concerned he just did not have time to deal with whatever my issue was.
16355,"E
excellent groceries"
16356,Great place with good portions.
16357,"The flock of hobos out front make for an awkward visit, especially with kids in the car."
16358,It's is a warm family friendly place great food and espresso and the employees are very welcoming and just all around great people 😁❤
16359,Good food friendly Clean and good food
16360,"I felt so comfortable during the whole process. Like working with family. :) I will definitely recommend it Lithia Kia to all of my friends. Especially Jesse. He was fantastic to work with!!! Great customer service. And very easy to talk to, and answered all my questions."
16361,Great breakfast.
16362,"Going out of business,  packed and empty as expected."
16363,"Great service, happy employees and yummy."
16364,"We stopped here on the way to Anchorage with a bus tour...fast, friendly service!!!"
16365,"Very nice, welcoming gentlemen...very informative."
16366,"Nice place for shopping. The plus sides are they have good carts and the trouble makers, inebriates, and transients aren't hanging around the front doors harrassing folks for money and wandering around inside like the other Walmarts in town. I noticed they're now locking up baby formula, 5 dollar cheap earphones, and even inexpensive book bags. Thanks to the thieves for making it that much more of a hassle to buy every day items.

Also: be sure to order in stock items online then pick them up.  I saved 14 dollars on my kids video game by doing this since they no longer price match their online prices."
16367,"This is a traditional Roman Catholic Church and the historic Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Anchorage. Serves the downtown area, but many parishioners from all around Anchorage, especially long time residents, attend services here because of its traditions. The parish is served by the order of Dominicans, both priests and nuns. Many who work downtown by attend daily, noon Mass. St Paul's Corner bookstore is an arm of this parish. It is a delightful store with many lovely sacramentals, books, and DVDs."
16368,"GREAT wraps,  friendly staff, affordable pricing. The chicken bacon ranch wrap is the BEST!!!"
16369,Very nice place for breakfast
16370,"Glacier  is calving,  kayaking is a good way to get around."
16371,"Anchorage Brewing is one of Alaska's best brewery's. Their beers are hand crafted small batch that are rich and deeply complex. Their tap room is is their brewing floor so you can see the cleanliness and quality of the equipment. Bar tenders are helpful, knowledgeable, and can recommend a beer for you. They have a continuously rotating tap with many guest taps. Every week is a new experience!"
16372,A must stop during your visit to the park
16373,"Great food, service, and coffee cup is never near empty!!"
16374,"Place turns in to a disaster zone at night. By far the worst stocked, and worst staffed Safeway I've ever shopped at. Only one register open after 9pm, causing the line to reach halfway to the back of the store. The few items that I shop for here are often never stocked. If I absolutely need everything in one trip, I shop elsewhere."
16375,Beans had little crunchy ends.
16376,"(Translated by Google) The food is great, but separate checks do not.

(Original)
Das Essen ist super, aber getrennte Checks machen sie nicht."
16377,Beautiful veggies
16378,Great bicycle ride nice little town.
16379,Great park!
16380,"Overall, very friendly staff. The downside is North Pole has out grown this store. This store is in need of a refresh on the inside. It is a great one stop shop for all your food needs. They have excellent fried chicken in the deli. Fair price and better than KFC.
There are some items that I would recommend you shop elsewhere for: toiletries, cleaning products, paper products. Safeway seems to be on the high side price for those items.
This store is very busy between 430-630pm.
Note: There is an Alaska USA CR and ATM in the back of the store."
16381,Take the train every year fun fun
16382,Awesome place awesome service and good quality products
16383,Had a Taco pizza was delicious. Sorry no pictures of it
16384,Fair pricing
16385,"Great food, awesome service."
16386,Great bakery! Everything tastes fantastic! I make a point to stop here every time I'm in Homer. Great selection! Gluten free options! Great place to sit and enjoy coffee and pastry! Service is always good!
16387,Not sure if it is worth all the hype ... but make sure to go when the weather is really good.
16388,They were really helpful when I needed to sell my truck.
16389,Good service. Fast and did not waste time offering to change every fluid in my car.
16390,Clean store..good produce..easy parking.
16391,Competitive pricing and great service.
16392,YEEHAW YEEHAW I GUESS ITS THE BUTTE
16393,Super duper yummy and outdoor seating was fabulous!

16397,Superior Food in an excellent place.
16398,Fun
16399,Great friendly Services
16400,"Extremely busy place during local events. Place seems to be understaffed, wiat time at front desk is too long"
16401,"Easy trail. Steep at the start, but quickly levels mostly out to easy ups and downs."
16402,Really
16403,Best in town
16404,It's a outback.  Not sure they are ever great. Not bad for a chain store.   I think it's a little pricey
16405,Best Chicken Fry
16406,Nice little store with cheap party supplies. Staff has always been friendly. Great place to get babyshower supplies and children's birthday supplies.
16407,Owner or very enthusiastic salesman was so welcoming and helpful. Great selection!
16408,"On larger orders check the details of each sandwich. They were quick, but they didn't put cheese on most of our sandwiches."
16409,Value and convenience it's Wally world
16410,Pricey for used parts but its here in Alaska.
16411,Great products at budget pricing.. you can now purchase most abundant flower for a price the blackmarket would envy! Quick efficient service.. with an eye on consistancy!! Keep the pen burnin bright!
16412,Cigarettes here are old and stale. The are also overpriced! Would NOT recommend shopping here.
16413,Nice little mall
16414,Incredible place to visit.
16415,The samoan lady cashier acted like a robot and couldn't smile or acknowledge me as a customer. And wouldn't even make eye contact with me. Horrible horrible service. She needs to get another job if she's not happy with her current one.
16416,I got a milkshake that was listed as a coffee  shake however it had no coffee flavor ice cream or flavor. Although the shake was excellent it lacked the very flavor listed on their menu.
16417,"Nice fair, smaller then I've been to but real nice and not expensive especially since you can bring your own food."
16418,"This place is amazing. Unique beers, great cocktails , good atmosphere and even better food"
16419,Love prices and variety
16420,Good coffee every time 😁👍
16421,"We live out in the Alaskan Bush, with no vet for 400 miles. When our dog started peeing blood and throwing up, we sought out a recommendation from our local dog rescue who pointed us to Midnight Sun. She is a very large pup (125lbs and lanky), and hates being away from her people, so I was nervous about shipping her out without us. From the moment she arrived at Midnight Sun, they were kind and communicative. They let me know when she arrived, and the vet herself (not a vet tech or receptionist, which is often the case) called to discuss her care, asking permission prior to performing X-rays, and patiently answering my questions even though it was late in the evening.  I am also in the medical field, which I did not disclose to her doctor at that time, and I was very impressed with how through she was, and how she spoke to me. She clearly is an animal lover and not just there for the income. I believe it was Doctor Hefley that I spoke with, but I'm not positive as it was late and I was exhausted. Luna had to spend the night due to flight times, and was to fly out the following day, but an incompetent courier service resulted in a second overnight stay. At this point I was really anxious to get my pup home, and I was delighted when one of the employees, Darby, called and asked if I would like pictures of Luna to settle my mind. Obviously I said yes. She was not in a crate, but a playpen with toys, getting attention from staff (I will say, she is a pro at getting attention ;) )

In regards to the cost of treatment: Yes, it's expensive. However, $200 for an X-ray is pretty standard at a vet. Vet fees vary for an office visit, but this is an emergency vet, so just like an ER visit for people, you have to assume a higher exam cost. This is not a lot cost clinic, however in being a pet owner, one must understand that there might be an emergency.  And unlike other vets that we have been to, we were not charged for repeat x-rays that they did to ""double check"" their own work the following morning.  Being a pet owner in a place that requires a flight and a courier to get my pup to the vet, I'm grateful that a place like Midnight Sun is there to treat her with compassion."
16422,Always nice.  And always there to refill glasses and great appetizers.
16423,The food is excellent here! A little higher priced than I prefer.
16424,"Easily the greatest quality movie experience in Anchorage. Aesthetics, sound quality, comfortable seating, and everything else is top quality.

The only time I would prefer a different theater in Anchorage over Tikahtnu is “$5 Tuesday” at Century. If you don’t know about “$5 Tuesday”, here’s a little PSA: Tickets are $5.50 each for any movie (except pre-release showings) every Tuesday at Century. And if your cellular carrier is AT&T, you get a “Movie Twosday” deal every Tuesday (it’s a buy one get one deal)!

So Century + AT&T + Tuesday = $5.50 for 2 tickets ($2.25 each)!!!!! You’re welcome.

That being said, Tikahtnu’s regular prices are cheaper than Dimond’s, and overall a better theater than Century. So if it’s not Tuesday and/or you don’t care about saving money on a Tuesday, this theater is your best bet!

By the way, for you AT&T people out there, Movie Twosday works at any theater. So definitely use it at Tikahtnu!"
16425,"Not to bad, have had much worse and much better, could be cheaper but still not to bad, kinda a let down on menu selection and Sake wasnt the best ether but overall worth the visit"
16426,Great selection of trout bait and plastic baits.
16427,Pretty good pizza for $5 Wednesday!
16428,Amazing fun and informative 5 stars
16429,Delicious coffee and pastries.
16430,"Awesome venue, great acts on a regular basis"
16431,"Good food, good value."
16432,"Almost always has what I need, and prices are pretty good too."
16433,"I do construction work for a living. I used to shop at nugget Alaskan Outfitter. I went out there looking for some duckback Carhartt bibs. No luck, they don't sell clothes like that anymore. Their clothing line, caters to the people that go out on a weekend, but not necessarily For the Working Man. Too bad. I never had a problem paying a little extra money for good quality clothing and footgear. Had to start shopping on the internet to get my work clothes. Very disappointing."
16434,"(Translated by Google) Yummmm

(Original)
Yummmm"
16435,Kids had a blast. I enjoyed watching them get adequate exercise and have fun.
16436,Large assortment of craft supplies and special event decor.
16437,"KMS has everything you need for fishing gear (rain gear), parts, souvenir and gift items, etc. They're always helpful and willing to special order parts or items that they don't have in stock."
16438,Always great coffee and atmosphere!
16439,Cool place
16440,Food was cold when they served. Surprising since it's on the warmer
16441,"Friendly staff, good food, fast service"
16442,We have been going here for years. Never had a donut that I would not finish. Coffee here is good too. But don't forget the ice cream. They have it all.
16443,I just started working there and so far I love the place and the staff very friendly and kind
16444,Food was cold and service was slow.
16445,It's great
16446,"Great food, wonderful atmosphere. Loved every bite. The amount of food you get a good amount and the flavors, yummy.

The tea, so delicious.  If you were on the fence of trying Ethiopian food, bring friends and a healthy appetite."
16447,Very nice. Our 2nd visit. Tried new items on the menu.
16448,It's alright
16449,Clean and comfortable
16450,Very nice brewery in Anchorage!
16451,"My family and I moved into Birchwood Homes Summer of 2019, they were very professional from getting our unit ready to the handover of the key. It has been a little over a year since then and any issues we have, they have responded promptly to all my emails and calls. The staff of Birchwood from maintenance to management is amazingly professional and supportive, especially Nikole and Taylor,  who will go to the ends of the earth for their tenants. The quality of the services is extremely high: they managed to take care of my needs and fulfill all my requests very efficiently. Whether it's a short or long stay, I highly recommend Birchwood homes."
16452,The staff is great and the food and drinks come quickly with a smile I'm never disappointed when I come here
16453,Great fried Halibut appetizer!!!

16458,It was decent food. Service was decent

16460,The personal at this store are exceptional however there is no tech support here or within 309 miles
16461,Second only to chick-fil-a
16462,Good Food. Love Pad See Ew was the best dish I ever have in my life!!! Also garlic pork and Panang curry with steam rice. So good. Will always go there for Thai food. Thank you for the good food. I recommend this place if you looking for some delicious food!!!
16463,This is an amazing place. Plan your vacation or cruise to see it.
16464,When the car is washed and polished it looks like birthday cake when you see the color of the stuff that the car is washed.
16465,Very professional great people to meet
16466,"Very filthy setup. Feces everywhere, some of the dogs appear to be malnourished, and they act neglected. They sell stolen and lost dogs and Donna is extremely rude when contacted by the legal owner to explain the situation. I only recommend this place of you enjoy getting scammed or enjoy paying large amounts of money for mistreated dogs. Loving Companions needs shut down."
16467,Great music store

16478,"Rude staff, food was cold because it sat too long"
16479,The food was DELICIOUS as usual and they sang to our daughter for her birthday!
16480,"Interesting sets, lots of decor to choose from.  Staff is pleasant yet non-intrusive if you clearly say ""I'm just looking"".  Grab a coffee out front or go for a subway sandwich to think over a purchase. Fun to buy or browse."
16481,Loved it. Fun. Great food vendors
16482,Awesome nail tech
16483,Nice place to shoot pool and have a beer
16484,Great place to watch some Ice Dogs hockey. I met some great people there and it's nice to see my grandfather's picture in the hall of fame.
16485,"Despite the rain, it was an active and interesting venue."
16486,This experience was terrific! It was my first massage and so i wasn't sure what to expect. Vanessa made me feel at ease from the start and was professional throughout. I liked the atmosphere and will definitely return. Thanks a million!
16487,"15 minutes later it was fixed it was done, and looks good."
16488,They were out of hot dogs 🌭🥺 but great ice cream! huge line and wait though! Worth it in the end ! 🍦
16489,Excellent freshly made crepes.  We enjoyed a savory and a sweet one.  They also make great mochas.
16490,Love this place!!
16491,Kids loved it

16494,Great service. Very accommodating for my keto diet!  Super yummy food too! Really great experience!
16495,Easy access and no line at the check out today.
16496,Is good there they have many thing to buy there
16497,Clean and efficient.
16498,I look younger and even more handsome!
16499,Breakfast was great.  I loved the portion sizes as it was more than enough
16500,Fast food
16501,This is meeting place for start of HAL 15 day tour  of Alaska !!!  Was GREAT !!!
16502,"Locally-owned with Cafe, restaurant, pub, and business center on-site"
16503,If you are a Alaskan or just visiting Alaska best place to get coffee.
16504,No long lines this time of the day.
16505,Under staffed. Not their fault. I am wondering what would happen if they rewarded employees in a way that would make life better for them?
16506,Excellent produce and bakery.
16507,"I don't go here nearly enough. The pizza is great and the service is so friendly. They go out of their way to make sure you leave happy. They gave my 3 year old a free scoop of ice cream which made her night! Big menu and delicious pasta, too!"
16508,"Ate breakfast 3 mornings at the Bake Shop. Good coffee, great omelettes, potatoes and friendly local favorite."
16509,"Consistent and decent Mexican food. And you can enjoy it with a cold beer.

(Great salsa selection too!)"
16510,"Their crab bisque is just heaven - rich, creamy, savory. Comes with garlic rolls for dipping that are equally divine. I've had dreams about the bisque alone. Original crab cakes are always fresh, with a slight kick, and fried to perfection. Crab legs are expensive, par for the course. You can make a delicious meal with just the bisque and crab cakes. Great location, lively and fun staff, always a treat to visit and worth the splurge."
16511,"Excellent, quick service. Channel and Dennis took care of my repair quickly and were really nice."
16512,Great food love the service a wide range of great dishes and u can range the heat from thi hot 1 to 10 I've had the times 10 it is legitimately one of the hottest dishes in fairbanks area and u can apply that to many of there dishes. I'd give them a 9 out of ten over all. Great job guys
16513,Authentic Thai food with fresh home cooked appeal and taste. The seasoning was well balanced and not overpowering. We will visit here often!
16514,"The staff at all of the Springhill Suites in Anchorage are always super friendly, and it has the best breakfast of the hotels I've stayed at in town as well. The lobby of this place is very trendy and cool too.

But that just sounds like a regular old hotel, you might be thinking. Why is this a five star review, you ask? Chupa Chups."
16515,Been going here for years. I love the beach as well as the cabin areas great place to have family celebrations in general.
16516,One of the nicest lodge in Alaska.
16517,Best sub shop in the state
16518,"Very clean,  front desk lady very nice.  Good restaurant. Beautiful view of the Harbor even in winter."
16519,Kind of pricy but good food
16520,We've been customers since they opened. Only complaint is they put capers in the crabcakes. I've eaten them my whole life and have never heard of such a thing. Other then that the food is great
16521,If you would like to learn about Valdez's history this is a good resource.
16522,"Best grocery store in Seward, AK."
16523,Not a lot of stores.
16524,Good Greek food
16525,"I always receive friendly service, and I love that I may sit where I choose."
16526,"Didn't go here for the coffee shop, was here for grocery, but New Sagaya doesn't even come up for this address?"
16527,Absolutely hands down the best place to eat.  Friendly servers and dining with the a small town feel!  The breakfast sandwiches are amazing if you're in a hurry.
16528,Awesome place for pizza and beer- often crowded with a lengthy wait.

16535,I wouldn't send my worse enemy to a mids in Alaska!
16536,Good selection today.
16537,Good for the Juneau prices
16538,Excellent spot in the Hatcher Pass Area. Loved the views and all the trail options. Hiking Alaska in the fall is especially wonderful!
16539,Always Awesome
16540,"Fair runs from 3rd week in August to Labor Day. Crowded like most state fairs, but not as bad on cloudy days. Coca-Cola has vending on site, and Pepsi is available at many of the food stands. There are a LOT of non-food vendors there, including at least one RV sales company (in-fair bank financing available). Many ride and game booths on the 'Main Walkway', including a Ferris Wheel."
16541,excellent food! good service!
16542,"It's not that I dislikes it, I had to get an auto glass repaired, it took two trips and getting rude with the glass people to get it done. Not liking it doesn't mean disliking it.  You show me 5 stars and I gave em two and then you claim that means dislike?"
16543,"Still 'fast' food, but tastier than most of the other options. Love the fries and Frosty!!"
16544,This place is amazing! It's a small restaurant but it has amazing food and service. The chicken pho is my favorite!
16545,"Their food is phenomenal, as well as their service and atmosphere.  We loved it! We especially loved our AWESOME HOSTESS,  Sarah!
Thank you for a great experience!
>>>>> HIGHLY RECOMMEND <<<<<"
16546,Great atmosphere!! Good service and coffee. If you're trying to chill and a have a good coffee go to Venue!
16547,Delicious!
16548,Good company
16549,Very good they are making nice course
16550,"It's a McDonald's, typical"
16551,"Nice clean rooms, they have soft beds and pillows!"
16552,Rude people! I don't like this place.
16553,Authentic Mexican food in Alaska.  Good stuff.
16554,"Very well organized, wonderful wide selection of edibles and CBD products, very personable, knowledgeable and HELPFUL budtender (hi  Terri!) Although I wasnt shopping for it, I did notice that the different strains of flower were well organized in glass jars, they have a nice collection of vape pens and really pretty glassware. There is a small selection of casual clothing. All wrapped up in a comfortable & upscale atmosphere. Did I mention they have REWARDS POINTS?!?"
16555,"Always a super fun time.  While folks who are used to big city aquariums might find it small, it has enough educational value to be worth the price of admission."
16556,"Clean bathrooms, well maintained parking, excellent view of Anchorage just minutes from the parking lot! Overall great trailhead."
16557,"Great place to go with friends and have a bonfire or do activities. Once in a while during the summer there's a man who will give horseback rides, sometimes for free!"
16558,"Amazing food, wish delivery was faster though"
16559,Nice folks that work there. Really good pizza. Don't forget to ask for garlic butter. Yummy.
16560,Consistent food and service quality.  A standout among the Anchorage restaurant scene.  These qualities also result in it being very busy on a regular basis.
16561,"Slow sometimes, but almost always really good."
16562,"Love the salons interior decor and cleanliness! However, I’ve NEVER had a tech do my nails and not clean or shave under the set. The tech, Crystal vibe was off and I was rushed the entire time so I didn’t even want to bother asking to fix or go back. This type of service should be therapeutic NOT rushed."
16563,Good customer service.
16564,Fantastic barbecue and a very decent beer list. The side orders were nicely done and they obviously take a lot of pride in their food! The brisket was very tender and wonderfully seasoned. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu and their sauces!
16565,Iike to eat there and make friends
16566,"Good food, but dont expect anything under 10 dollars"
16567,"Huge multi platform outdoor jungle gym complete with swing sets, slides, monkey bars, and MUCH more. There's also a lazy river (raft & canoe friendly) that runs through a Giant field of green grass to play on, or have a picnic! There's also access to the well known Coastal Trail that runs through a decent majority of the city of Anchorage, AK."
16568,It's my go to vape shop. Friendly atmosphere
16569,Great curring establishment that takes care if their customers and customers keeo coming back.  Also they have take out pizza.
16570,A decent seafood selection that they can ship to the lower 48 if you're visiting from there. A deli and cafe for lunch stops.
16571,Easy to buy stuff and I had zero problems
16572,"What is with this place? Every time I eat there it is supremely disappointing. I ordered the cheeseburger, which I decided on upon seeing the first menu, then I was brought a different menu by our server which was not actually the correct menu for the event as there was a third brought after we ordered, but the cheeseburger was on the first two so that is what I had ordered. It was not however what I got. What I got was a slider, charred within an inch of its life, on a hamburger sized bun. It was sad to say the least. I really wish I had gotten the third menu before putting in my order because the dishes other people were getting looked supremely better. I couldn't help but think the kitchen was mad at us for ordering something that wasn't on that menu so they took it out on our food. Later when I wanted to order something else because unsurprisingly I was still hungry after my one slider, I could not get my server's attention. Like to the point where it started getting comical, she walked close enough I could almost touch her 5 times without a glance in my direction where I was desperately trying to get her attention. I only go to Williwaw for special events, because other than the activities all my food experiences have been so bad. Next time they have something I want to do going on I will go to eat somewhere else. I think I finally learned my lesson."
16573,Very nice.  Family setting was welcoming after a busy day.  Great food.
16574,I had an amazing experience. Robbie was awesome he went well above and beyond my expectations.  On top of that my salesperson Walter never once pressured me and was so knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and family.  I wouldn't buy a car anywhere else
16575,"Reviewed for what it is. An AC Store off the road system, in winter. Stuff is expensive here ( Dillingham) This store most visits  has decent selection of veggies, fruit and bagged salads. Lots of other basics. It also had stuff I needed when I needed it that is off the wall for a grocery store. Gas can, Motor oil, phone chargers, blue tooth headset.

My go to of the options here for salad stuff :0)"
16576,"Excellent pub food! Beer and mixed drinks, entrees. Plenty of room inside and out. Would definitely recommend."
16577,"I had a chip filled for $40 and that covers up to 3 chips, as I only had one to be filled I was given a voucher for the other 2 chips free! This is the best price you will find in Anchorage hands down!!! Staff is fast and friendly, appointments only so call before you go in and save a few bucks in gas you won't regret it for the price."
16578,Lots of stored
16579,"I feel very confident in the service I received from Kimberly. She’s answers all my questions, and has a great deal of knowledge. The front staff are very friendly. The nurses are very friendly. The place feels very welcoming and upscale."
16580,Everything you need
16581,Loved Sitka
16582,This park is decent with a semi good playground best thing going for it are the trails and the walks over the creek.

16585,"Absolutely love this place! The staff is amazing, friendly, great with kids, and very efficient at their job. The food is always fresh and hot. One of my favorite lunch spots in town."
16586,Great selection
16587,It is Mcdonalds you like it or you do not.

16594,Perk Up is the best espresso stand in the valley. The coffee is consistently good.
16595,Like the new look. Food is great with great prices. Everything you need in one stop. I'll keep coming back. Thanks
16596,Love Friday $5))))) sale...
16597,Everyone was very nice
16598,Always my fav!!
16599,Good selection
16600,Nice people
16601,Mall in the middle of town
16602,"Service Dept lacks The ""customer service"" part"
16603,"Great Selection ,Very Knowledgeable, Great Employees"
16604,Has a nice hill used to have picnics on it.
16605,"When you can't find it anywhere else, it's usually at Walmart."
16606,Good food for a small town. And very friendly staff
16607,"Food isnt very good
But they were really friendly"
16608,"Made me mad they didn't call my numbers. Get on, and the next number was mine three times out of five games.😦"
16609,Great family place
16610,Great staff!!!
16611,The people
16612,"Waited at the counter 20 minutes for my take out. To add insult to the experience, I was IGNORED most of the time and had to jockey for attention, which was unprofessional. Sorry, I'm not a hot tall babe, BOYS!"
16613,Yes it was ok. There
16614,"Food came quickly but the pizza was completely raw in the center. Called to ask for a cooked pizza to be sent and at first I was told to put it in the oven to finish cooking and I'd get a discount next order. I said they can have the raw pizza back but I paid for edible food and that's what I want and only then was I told a new pizza would be sent out. They need to work on customer service at the phone center, I didn't ask for free food but simply what I paid for."
16615,Enjoy the staff. Were good about letting you know if it would be better to come back if they were really busy.
16616,"Takeout only during COVID, waited 15 min for food after ordering. Food was tasty, they were super kind to my daughter that was with me. Food was tasty. Good portions."
16617,"Friendly, knowledgeable, fast and efficient. Cool shop. Great selection."
16618,"Not much of a choice for food, not anything that I care for, especially when traveling from a different community. Cafeteria is closed to the public. Sad when you can't get a good meal, coming from another town. Eat before you go there."
16619,Good people. The are always helpful to me
16620,"Verry Nice, clean  More diferent  👍👍👍"
16621,"Great, fun tour"
16622,Excellent customer service and the ice cream was fantastic!
16623,Beautiful dealership! No charge for checking out my car
16624,Really nice hotel. I was only there to get a drink but it was a very pleasant experience.
16625,"Its the second time I have stayed there, everyone is very courtious."
16626,Fair service and quality of beer
16627,"Some of the employees where actually doing their job, but two of them a long dark haired guy and some chunky chick with curly hair were sitting behind there desks looking stuff up on there computers, then they were drinking tea and encouraging each other to ""chug"" it. Very unprofessional."
16628,"Great variety, my previous visit I left a review that had three stars and I feel a single visit isn't a good indicator for the quality of this store. The selection of fish is near impossible to beat here in Alaska and the staff are quite knowledgeable. The fluval 207 filter I got had a broken locking mechanism but nothing super glue couldn't fix. The prices are pretty good."
16629,Great craft store
16630,"A beautiful place to go. You have a beautiful sandy beach and wonderful historical buildings at the old Treadwell mine historic trail. A must see when you visit the Juneau area, located on Douglas island and a short drive from downtown Juneau, Alaska.
* * *Among my favorite places in the Juneau area."
16631,Excellent pizza and service. The beer selection is top notch.
16632,"Very tasty food, good service, quite atmosphere"

16641,"good food, alright prices, great service"
16642,Excellent prompt service!
16643,"Incredible experience, and worth every penny!!"
16644,"Cold Stone's is a classic treat! The menu and variety of choices is amazing. Ice cream cones, cups, shakes, smoothies and birthday cakes are available for your indulgence. You can't help but to Like It, Love It and Gotta Have It!"
16645,"(Translated by Google) In my eyes, no real sneaker store. Very small selection and models and not to mention the color selection. I have never seen such a bad foot locker. No exclusivity and nothing. The staff are helpful. As far as they can stop it.

(Original)
In meinen Augen kein richtiger Sneaker Store. Sehr kleine Auswahl and Modellen und von der Farbauswahl ganz zu schweigen. Ich habe noch nie so einen schlechten Foot Locker gesehen. Keine Exklusivität und nichts. Die Mitarbeiter sind aber hilfsbereit. Soweit sie es können halt."
16646,"Home away from home, be there in July. Great staff always a pleasure."
16647,Always a great place for a great sandwich.  Ordering is via a sheet but they turn around the orders quickly.  The bread is top notch - one of the best sandwich places in town (sure beats Subway).
16648,🍤🍤🍤
16649,Good food
16650,Very clean and comfortable. Great valley for your money. Would stay again
16651,Great service performed quickly

16658,"The golf course is good, just to spended. I have played at much better course's in the lower 48 for a lesser price."
16659,Dirty
16660,"It's McDonald's. What else can I say ? At least, if you come here, you should pretty much know what you're going to get."
16661,Great food and service was awesome
16662,Beautiful
16663,"Sorry guys - I had clients stay there twice this summer, and they both said it was a solid thumbs down experience. I don't know what changed, I know people who stayed there several years ago and they all liked it. But this year, folks said it was dirty, unpleasant, rude service, disorganized and loud."
16664,Nice
16665,It is a fun place to visit.  The prices are very expensive. Don't forget to see the Reindeer next door.
16666,Always busy
16667,The food was pretty good. I was surpriseed because it had been awhile since our last visit and that one wasn't to great. We are happy that we gave them another chance.
16668,"Awesome burgers, sides, and shakes. They put good attention to quality and service. The prices are a little high, but it's always a treat to eat here for lunch; especially sitting in the back or outside looking at the lake."
16669,Top notch gear at great Alaska prices.
16670,"Right along Hwy 1 just south of Anchorage.  Stop by for a quick hike, to see a waterfall or just to take pictures of the mountains and sea.  Costs $5 to park for the day.  There are pit toilets, picnic tables, and hiking trails.  Stop by and enjoy the day."
16671,Top of the world sub
16672,Good
16673,"Nice stuff,. Overpriced unless there is a sale"
16674,"Good food and friendly service, margarita was so,so."
16675,Floors were dirty but food was good
16676,Great personnel and affordable services
16677,Love the place
16678,Fast.
16679,So-so. I would suggest either the hilton or sheraton over this place.
16680,Good pet store. I take my dog in for grooming the staff is great with her. She can be skittish and scared but they calm her right down.
16681,We visited the bar and Alaina the bartender talked up the flight deck food to us. She make us some good drinks and the food was awesome. Definitely coming back again!
16682,Great location good food
16683,I was blessed enough to take this cruise on a clear day.  The crew and the park ranger were excellent!
16684,Good food big menu the home of the biggest root beer float in our end of Fairbanks. Nostalgia setting hotrod style.
16685,"My roommate and I have been going to this movie theater at least once a month (we like doing a monthly roomie movie date). It has always been comfortable, the staff friendly and helpful, and they have plenty of snacks to choose from. I particularly like the pretzel bites with cheese, although I do wish they came with more pretzels (a girl can dream, right?). Lately, however, the theater has been outdoing itself and now has heated reclining seats that make movie dates 1000% more enjoyable. They've been offering more variety in the snacks as well. They also have a sort of loyalty program where you can reserve seats on their app and get 20% discount on food, which we have enjoyed a lot. Great place! We love it a lot."
16686,Best prices and knowledge assistance to help you find what you need
16687,Typical Wal-Mart. Complete with Walmartians.
16688,"Great food, mediocre service"
16689,Way over rated.
16690,"Great staff!
Good coffee as always!"
16691,For a chain restaurant the menu has something for everyone. Also I've never seen changing tables with the liners till today! Thank you!
16692,It's a place to go
16693,"Drips is a nice little coffee hut about 2 miles south of the knotty shop in North Pole. Overall this is a quant little place to stop for a coffee, smoothie or something to eat.
Personally I think the food is better than the coffee, but none of it is bad. Service is always good, but Ravens Brew coffee is not a good coffee IMO. The food is tasty and on Fridays stop by for their brisket.
Little pricier than most coffee shops, but it's in the middle of no where and last place for a decent cup of coffee for 15 miles to North Pole and 75 miles before Delta Junction. But food is worth the stop either way."
16694,"Not only do they have great thick bacon but they have delicious sourdough pancakes!

When you visit you must order the Summer of 76 Breakfast!

Don't forget to bring cash! They don't accept credit cards here. If the Sitz is open (the restaurant next door) you can sneak over there and use their ATM."
16695,Great all around steakhouse
16696,Fun for the family
16697,"Clean, quick and love the burgers"

16701,"Fresh hot Food..fast service..make it
your way or order off the menu..all delicious"
16702,Convenient location
16703,"Best steakhouse in Anchorage, loud and rowdy yet family friendly."
16704,"Always a favorite spot for a quiet cup of coffee, we often stop by.  The food is decent if limited.  We firmly believe Kaladi makes the best coffee in town and the baristas make a great cuppa.  There is also a space with a nice, long table that can be reserved for larger group meetings."
16705,Good stock employees hit and miss
16706,They did work on my truck. They are the only place I will go
16707,"Teen nightclub that operated out of here on weekends had wrong hours posted,  causing teenagers to be sitting outside in the cold."
16708,Great place
16709,"We loved our evening at 229 Parks.  The service was welcoming and gracious and the food was excellent.  This place is such an amazing treat, located near Denali National Park, one of the most beautiful places on earth.  Everything about our meal was extra special and filled with delight."
16710,"This dealer sells Mazda, Volvo, and Nissan. They service department is clean, friendly, efficient and has coffee. Price is a little steep and cost $125 to change the synthetic oil in my 2006 Volvo but they did a free car wash and quick inspection while being very responsive to questions.

Update 2020
They are only used to the new model Volvos. They couldn't even figure out which back wiper model i needed and if the arm was broken when I started by telling them the model of wiper i needed. If you have an older vehical just go to Independent auto and talk to Tarn Coffee so u don't waste time ordering useless parts and having to try 3 different wipers because they are so sure it's the right one this time."
16711,Amazing customer service! They always do my nails beautifully.
16712,"Take Wings Airlines out for a great salmon lunch or diner. The flight was awesome with spectacular views.  You land at Taku Lodge where the salmon is being cooked and the bears are waiting in the trees. The staff was fun and informative about the history of Taku Lodge and the dinner was fantastic. After dinner you can explore the property and take a hike back into the woods. Top 2 on my list of things to do in Juneau, AK"
16713,A great place to buy outdoor gear and staff is very knowledgeable.
16714,I want to live here❣️
16715,Good food and nice atmosphere!
16716,"49th has atmosphere perfect for a downtown Anchorage culture. Being a fan of the original location in Healey I wasn't surprised when they brought all the favorites of their craft beers, gastro pub delights, and chill vibes to the big city. Expect wait times on the weekends but there is plenty of room upstairs/downstairs. Great selection of pizzas, burgers, and my all time favorite side order of Chili and Lime Chicharones."
16717,Greeatt
16718,Staff is very friendly and helpful!
16719,Great place for
16720,Smdh seems like the projects or section 8 to me... but what do i know..

16727,"Lovely setting, fabulous service and food to die for."
16728,Great to know where to find great office need's.
16729,Very helpful staff.  They have Northern Lights radar to assess you chances of seeing the aurora and when is the best time.  Lots of brochures and magazines. Fun ice sculpture out front and a nice park across the street.
16730,Great breakfast.
16731,"Best pizza in town, great video games for the kids. Perfect for birthday partys, young and old. Great staff. Fast service."
16732,Great Atmosphere. Excellent wine selection. The Halibut is my personal favorite. The sweet almond sauce was devine. Pizza is a bit bland. Avoid it. All together great experiences.
16733,Great hamburgers and a good place to pass some time if a flight is delayed.
16734,"Caleb is an amazing, absolutely amazing service rep for this location. Seriously go in and ask for him you will not be disappointed at all. Guy should be the manager of the location. I solely go to this location to get that man's knowledgeable help when I need parts."
16735,"It's one of those places if you like or need something that's there you can love it.  We love Jen's.  Don't let the center fool you, Chef Nancy takes great pride in her food quality and your over-all experience.  It's not cheap but neither is the quality."
16736,We just went for the scenery and was gorgeous.
16737,Tasty pancakes
16738,"Clean, good looking place."
16739,Loved the Texas Tenors. Gre as t show
16740,Need more seating
16741,Best food and best service. I enjoyed.
16742,Great customer service they do a great job overall however their tire and rim prices seem to be extremely outrageous
16743,"Because of covid, you go to the door and give the security guard your name and phone number. You can wait in your warm car until it's your turn, then he or she will call you and you can go inside to see a representative.  The secret guard works just as hard as the reps, but they are all friendly and it's nice to wait in your car and not standing in a long line."
16744,Good information centre and museum. The local teenagers perform on stage and explain what they are doing to reclaim their culture. Worth a visit.
16745,Always so helpful
16746,Melissa did a great job finding discounts and best prices for my insurance needs. State Farm is highly recommended by me.
16747,Small menu but everything is fantastic. Oh and you have to eat the cheese!!
16748,Love the place....knowledgeable and very nice selection.
16749,Will forever be grateful to VI for giving me a chance to prove myself...
16750,We really appreciate the effort they have out into providing an inside dining experience.
16751,Wonderful place to visit. Much information about the park. Great staff
16752,Try not to shop there ever. Walmart ruins more lives than helps
16753,"Plenty of space currently,  half off for parking. The SILVERS should be in soon, Pinks currently running..."
16754,Need friends. Adults are welcomed too.
16755,Large fenced areas for variety of local wildlife
16756,Good
16757,Love dr. Rappe.
16758,The quality of items are good for the cheap prices. Staffs and owner inspects every item donated to the store. And gives store credit if your item sells. This is a great community store. My children and I loves this place. Also beside good items the staff and owner are super friendly. And the place is clean 😀
16759,"Best glazed salmon I've ever had.  Plenty of good food and Pioneer Park is fun to walk through.
We went to that show at the Palace Theater. Lots of fun and learned a lot.  I highly recommend it."
16760,This place was so much fun!  Friends took me up to share the views and the famous fizzy drink.  A great place to bring the visiting family.
16761,Great selection of good food.
16762,"How can you go wrong in this enormous, beautiful temperate rainforest? Tongass is best explored by boat; we sailed with UnCruise Adventures, but you can also charter a boat. Be bear aware!"
16763,"I loved my steak bowl! Friendly service and delicious, delicious food."
16764,Nice new mall.
16765,This is a nice facility with all the normal stores you would expect from a mall.   The food court is on the top floor and has good selection.   Free wifi was available but i'm not sure if it was from the mall or I was stealing it from some other store.   Parking across the street was convenient and not very expensive.   It isn't a large metal but very tall with several floors connected by escalators.
16766,"Great place to meet people for gatherings, have a BBQ, picnics, play sports, and walk and play with your animals"
16767,Fantastic shop with a great team of professionals!  Best shop around.
16768,Best pho broth in town. Reasonable prices
16769,"Food, people and location just fantastic.  Thank you so much"
16770,"No room thermostat, little chilly."
16771,Great food!
16772,Good hand pressed burgers and yummy fries!
16773,"Used to be good. The food has ranged from just 'okay' to very good. The service, however, has been going downhill. They forget orders, will leave your drinks empty with no service for easily over 20 minutes, and can't seem to get the specifics on orders right."
16774,Takes the fast out of fast food
16775,Awesome is sad im kiding awesome is fun
16776,Best summer wraps ever
16777,Hands down the best gluten free waffles I have ever had! And their baked goods (all gf) are amazing. I haven't had a pumpkin roll in a decade and it was better than I remember! The coffee is great and the staff is awesome. Will definitely return.
16778,"Some very unusual selections for a Gaijin like me.  They have Kirin and Sapporo also, good wait staff, clean place.  Decor could be better but I did like the way they had Anime/Manga and cross cultural posters.  Recommended."
16779,Nice deli
16780,"Great selection, deals on liquor."
16781,Good place to take kids
16782,No complaints. Good service. Wish our Costco in Canada too visa as the one here does. More food choices at food court than Canada. Better prices as well even with exchange.
16783,One of the best pizza places in town. Open late and good prices!
16784,Good place to store stuff.
16785,Great tire shop in the valley
16786,"You want a real experience hiking on a Glacier, this is it. Be prepare to rent or buy ice shoes to put your foot on ice."
16787,"Best memories to make with friends and family, the price is expensive but the you know it was worth it. The food is above excellent, great variety of stands. The ride and games are good for everyone."
16788,They ring up stuff twice and I have been calling  to talk  to someone about  and they don't answer
16789,Everything you need for fishing gear!
16790,"The place looks like it could be a lot of fun. However really didnt get a chance to find out. However am changing from a negative experience to a positive one as the situation that had stopped us from experiencing anything there as far as activities was possibly a fluke and the manager did in the end come through with my request
And although at first my impressions were negative he did succeed to win me over and will give them another opportunity to earn my hard worked for dollars simply because of his coming to be a man of his word"
16791,Overall interior decor could be. modernized. Other than that it is a nice small mall.
16792,Best hot out of the oven.
16793,It's Fred Meyer
16794,Wallmart on Muldoon has got to be the worst place to shop. Good luck trying to find someone to help you. Always lines. The employees are far from polite. There are a few that are helpful. Eagle River's Wallmart is the best. I always walk in with a smile. And walk out the same😀
16795,Lunch at the Native elders. Meals are ample. Good. Nutritious.
16796,"I went here for an alignment, I recommend Alyeska tire for Alignments and anything to do with tires. They really know their business!"
16797,"Pangea has a lovely rotating menu of tapas like fusion dishes, which would earn 5 starts from me except the experience can be very uneaven. The kitchen has a hard time maintaining a high level of quality, some visits the food is just amazing, and others it's only adequate."
16798,Great
16799,"Oh my God, dudes. These guys are terrible on the phone and even worse in the office. Long lines, doofus customers, smelly lobby, ugh all around."
16800,"The Mongolian beef is good, the chow mien isn't so good though. Always nice place to eat out or food for pick up.."
16801,"Northern Tea House provides a small, pleasant atmosphere for tea in a social setting in two seating areas, one with a couch, the other with a small table setting.  It's a comfortable space with a rather large selection of teas or bubble teas.  Sometimes there are little sweets also available, depending on what's available.

After looking over their menu of multiple pages of teas, some of which are no longer available, two possibilities stood out for me to try.  Royal Chinese Milk Tea was selected, or Masala Chai.  What size, I chose the 20 oz and then selected half and half.

The place filled up with several more customers shortly before they were scheduled to close, daily 1200-1700.  I liked the taste of my milk tea, my spouse chose Turkish tea, said that it wasn't dark enough.  Turkish tea I believe is brewed very strong, very dark, where an amount is drawn, then diluted with hot water in the cup.

There's a loyalty program when you pay with a credit or debit card."
16802,"Great service, decent food, ""the only game in town."""
16803,"I love this place. Friendly, fast, and delicious."
16804,Delicious and friendly.
16805,So much family fun.
16806,"Usually friendly staff. A bit small and lacking in some departments like sketchbooks, painting, soapmaking. Nice rotation of fabrics."
16807,Expensive but convenient
16808,Love eating lunch here. Amazing food that's quick and not very expensive. Great environment and the customer service is fantastic.
16809,I'm quite happy with the work Haley did. I went to this salon because a colleague had a great experience. I went to a different stylist and also left happy. That's a great sign. I'll be back.
16810,Perfect 👌
16811,Kids love it! Definitely worth a visit.
16812,Nice place in alaska
16813,"Great produce and wide selection of merchandise. Low, competitive prices. Quick & easy self checkout."
16814,"Good quality meats and cheese at a decent price.  However, the bread is consistently dry and they can never get a special order correct.  I think they are overrated."
16815,A surprising little gem.  Good food great service.
16816,Little bit of everything restaurant
16817,"Amazing place! Lots of hidden gems in this bookstore, upstairs you can find some great used books. And they will take your old books you're done reading and give you credit to pick some new ones from their used section!."
16818,"Decent diner staples served fairly quickly, the place seems very popular with the locals."
16819,Decent place to live
16820,Awesome mom and pops food of all kinds of cravings. I really like their burgers.
16821,Classic bar in anchorage.
16822,"Ordered Spagetti w/ meatball. Says endless spagetti but you pay up for ea. meatball. Sauce has way too much red wine vinegar in it and servings are very small. Expect to get your ""endless"" bread with your entree. And it's terrible. No parmesan or fresh ground pepper either. Will not eat here twice."
16823,Love the friendly staff and the fact that they are kid friendly
16824,"The lines are always long, but the staff is friendly."
16825,Always great ;) good food great service and hood atmosphere.
16826,The food is wonderful with courteous staff!
16827,Good burgers
16828,"We always such a great experience! The food is so good, the service is great and everyone is so friendly!"
16829,Beautiful site.
16830,Cozy and fun to walk and take in view
16831,My animals received only the best treatment! My cats had several appointments and everything went smooth. The staff took good care of my critters with a vast option of services provided!
16832,"I like this place ,,,, it's a nice place to go on a date or with your family"
16833,Lunch every other week or so
16834,Fun times at good prices.
16835,I've always have good fast service here
16836,Best Pizza!
16837,Always helpful and attentive. Busy so call ahead if you're in a time crunch. They're busy because they are good.
16838,I love this place! Food is great!
16839,One of the most beautiful parts of the world.
16840,Awesome food and hostess/cashier was awesome!
16841,I’ve always loved the sandwiches here. They offer so many combinations on their menu but are happy to take orders for any sandwich you can dream up. This place has been around for a long time and has a solid Eagle River following. Much of that is due to the warm welcome they give every customer. You will not be disappointed!
16842,"Good service, Great homemade food!"
16843,The view from the train on our trip to Fairbanks and return to anchorage were clear   the mountain showed off all it's glory
16844,Nice staff
16845,"Look for the Milepost 229 - .
Our Nenana River rafting guide recommended 229.  As soon as we stepped inside we knew we were in for a treat.  No more pizza and fried chicken, not here. The dining room was elegant, warm wood tones and roomy. The bar had fantastic massive wood cutting surrounding the bar.  It is a work of art.  The large glass windows allowed you view the side yard and hope to see a moose. That night, we observed what  were mostly locals coming in for dinner in groups.  So nice to walk with and feel welcomed.

We were there for 2 dinners and were impressed with the grilled halibut, cream of dill soup, a fresh blue cheese salad, and fresh salmon.  We enjoyed the Dill soup, and the halibut TWICE.  The fish was sweet, moist and tender. that's all I ask. It was a brilliant dining experience.  So glad we could come here for a quiet dinner, instead of the massive crowded noisy dining halls in Denali village.
The desserts were great but the home brewed root beer float with their home-made ice cream was the best I had in decades!  I should have ordered another one, silly me.  I won't make that mistake again.
We'll always go back to 229 when in the Alaska Interior. We have to ask Laura for her recipe for the luscious Dill Soup."
16846,The trails are well marked for plenty of outdoor fun!
16847,A lot of potential here. Just like any mall it's packed on weekends. It just needs more attractions for the weekdays.
16848,"Love this place, always great food and great service!"
16849,"I had to go to the DMV 3 times in the past 2 months. Each time I went after 3pm. The longest I waited was 25min. One I was in and out the door in 15min.
There is a reason they list peak times, I avoid them."
16850,"Slow service, sandwich not completely done, and did not get my frosty."
16851,Now that's a tasty Burger
16852,Great Food and Service. Steak Fajitas were wonderful
16853,We need a Marty Raney day where he tells stories and sings songs and Lowes gives him free lumber because his house burnt down in Hatchers Pass.
16854,Awesome home made honey infused ice cream. The Cappuccino is the best I've ever had.
16855,Great service
16856,McDonald's Alaska is the worst I've seen in the world!
16857,Waiters are always on point with their service.
16858,Beautiful!
16859,"Food is typical Arby's but I didn't care for the friendliness of the staff or the lack of guidance where things like the drinks, sauces, napkins, or straws were located.  Like most places anymore they don't seem to understand that the easiest customers to get are the one's you already have."
16860,"Loved the food. Sodas are served in chilled mugs. Malted milkshakes, good burgers, good fries, good fish and chips. 50's style diner. The waitresses are very nice and helpful. Love the atmosphere."
16861,Kool. Great food.
16862,They made my ugly feet look less ugly. Nice ppl good prices. Would come back.
16863,"Amazing service and if you ask for it to be crazy smothered with gravy, be assured it will be!!!! Best breakfast in town!!!!!"
16864,"NEW OWNER !!!! BEWARE !!!
No insurance??? You need to pay for it yourself IN FULL NOW !!
NO MORE 20% off for paying at the time of service in full."
16865,I'm here all the time. Always a great cup of coffee.
16866,"Good food. Slow service,but friendly"
16867,"I prefer Lowe's over HomeDepot, because their prices are normally lower, they have better quality, and they don't cap military discount at $50 like HD"
16868,one of the best breweries in the world right here in anchorage.
16869,Prompt and great customer service
16870,Great food and great service with a nice atmosphere
16871,"Is this the best pizza around, no.
However, the staff has always been helpful to me. The pizza is pretty good, I do like their crust. And the prices are better than almost any other pizza joint.
I always order in person, and I tip. So I cannot speak to phone and internet orders. But they have never done me wrong.
Pretty hard to beat when you need a pizza.
Ignore the bad reviews. Everyone has an off day. In general GAPCO is my go-to if I am not making my own and don't want to spend nearly $20 on a pie."
16872,"Place was not crowded, but 30 mins just to get menus. The halibut tacos had almost no fish in them. They forgot to put in one of the people at the tables food. They are an Alehouse that is out of almost every beer they claim to have."
16873,Love this place. Been spending quite a bit of time there recently. :)
16874,Disnintresred staff
16875,Good burgers and sandwiches! My goal is to try every item on their menu lol
16876,Absolutely fabulous! The caramel was just amazing! I didn't want it to end. Hope to get back to here before we leave.
16877,Just liked it
16878,Love the yarn here!
16879,"Fun! Not too crowded, decent pricing and staff really friendly."
16880,It's the same
16881,"If you're a fan of local brews and food, this is a place to check out. The mac and cheese options are delightful, and always leave you with leftovers.
They have a great appetizer menu with options like a yakadilla, nachos, and even fried avocado.
A good place for tourists to check out while in town!"
16882,"Absolute best views of Anchorage. If you are visiting from out of town, its worth the trip. Visiting in the summer? Climb Flatop!"
16883,"It's now called Satly's and it's honestly horrible. Went there with a group of friends to have Italian style food and was super disappointed when I was handed a new menu with over priced snack like items. Mainly sandwiches and salads. Paid for the drinks and the appetizer that we ate (the waitress tried to charge us for the other one that didn't even come out yet) They should really have signs up saying that it's changing and the wait staff should address it as soon as they seat people.
It sucks that they sold the place, Geraldo's is only a few miles away and we'll be going there from now on."
16884,They did not get my order correct. I had ordered fish and shrimp but only received shrimp in my to go bag. Always check your order before you leave. I know this but today I was lazy and got screwed.
16885,"Never been to the top, but the views are beautiful."
16886,The artistic craftsmanship is beautiful!
16887,Too much gunk on their sandwiches and the fries were mushy with WAY Too Much salt
16888,Great food friendly
16889,I love this place
16890,🙌
16891,Good food and friendly staff
16892,Different selection of products here compared to Fred Meyers. Many things can be rather expensive compared Fred's but produce at Carr's is our main focus. The whole section seems to be better suited environmentally and better equally fruits and veggies. We come here at least once a week for certain things. Staff is usually friendly and helpful. They need to have more self checkout stands that work which can be a pain during high traffic times.
16893,Nice quiet and secluded place. Great lake for swimming and kayaking
16894,Nice place but a little dirty
16895,Good place to spend a couple hours.  The displays and layout have been done well. A little spendy for admission but other than that a great place.
16896,You gotta have gas!!!😣
16897,"Super well organized for a thrift store, clean"
16898,Absolutely loved the rooms here. The old lady an I couldn't have asked for a better stay here 👍
16899,"Convenient where I live, but sometimes hard to find help."
16900,"Great coffee, wide food menu selection. Love the breakfast sandwiches. Baristas always friendly and quick."
16901,To expensive for no room service
16902,"Pretty expensive, but the ingredients are ultra high quality. The drink menu is very limited--and no water available is quite strange, to be honest. But what we did get was delicious."
16903,"The food is a bit expensive for what you receive.  They never refunded me for a purchase that I was double-charged for.  They arguably have some of the worst customer service on a consistent basis that I have ever witnessed at an establishment.  Consequently, I've never gone back to their establishment after attempting to give them several tries.  One star for you."
16904,"Excellent customer service and wide selection of equipment, from starter stuff to professional stuff."
16905,Very nice and clean. Walking in you instantly get a small town feeling. The service was excellent and the food was great. Prices are reasonable. Great family restaurant. My family's must stop any time we are in town.
16906,Best place in town for kids to get a haircut. All the adults getting haircuts appeared to he well taken care of too.
16907,"Not much here, but the stores that are there are nice. They just arent places I'd normally shop, so I won't return."
16908,"I came here for lunch and their specials and combos are a great deal. The food was cooked and prepared very well. I've eaten at places that cost way more that didn't taste as good as Arigato. I ordered the deep fried chicken & gyoza which was cooked perfectly and you could tell the chef did not rush and took their time. I will be trying their katsu don next time, too many choices! The service was excellent, don't let the outside fool you, I will definitely be coming back soon!"
16909,"Food is pretty good, they do try hard to get it right or make it correct. Menu offers a good selection and price range is nice you can eat on a budget or splurge. Friendly service but can get busy."
16910,Must see if you are into birds.
16911,Home repair heaven
16912,I was Abit bummed out that they don't have the balsa wood puzzles that you push out the pieces n glue them together
16913,Great little hole in the wall. Authentic cuisine such as sour curry is amazing.
16914,Beautiful women everywhere! This place is a blast?
16915,$20 for two crispy tacos? This place is over priced and not worth it.
16916,service and portions are hit and miss
16917,This is a great place that has really good food.
16918,"All Kaladi shops are great. Sometimes the homeless go here to stay warm, so you have to request a bathroom key. Still a nice shop."
16919,Found it here !
16920,People here r pretty  kool. Only problems was the menu scrolls way too fast. U cant really see what they have. And this is THE ONLY 1 ive seen that doesnt check your ID BEFORE they open the door for you to go in. You just walk rite up to counter.... Then they check it. Pre-rolls r so small compared to others.... Same weight just seems to b shake tho.
16921,Beautiful country.  Therapeutic experience.
16922,"Small rooms, shared community bathroom"
16923,A great find in Ninilchik.  Great food with great service!
16924,Not a bad place but seems to have a hard time keeping businesses at a couple of the stores.
16925,What can I  saw... lots of yummies
16926,Perfect!
16927,I really enjoyed my meal and the dessert! I have lived here 2 years and finally got to eat in and the price was good to top it off. Atmosphere for a Friday night was nice also with very vibrant and upbeat decor as I like my Mexican restaurants. Glad I got to eat there before the summer rush crowds.
16928,Great place
16929,"In October, my friend and I happened to be passengers in a friends rental. The rental was a nice 2018 Ford Fusion that was silver in color and ridiculously clean on the in and outside of the car. It was a smooth ride and quite nice. Until, I was handcuffed and separated from my property in the vehicle and brought to APD Headquarters. It was there I learned that the vehicle had been reported stolen and our friend, the driver had borrowed it from his friend to take to the mall. However, it only gets worse from here on out. Our friend's friend' actually ""borrowed"" this car from her ""friend."" In which Enterprise reported the rental stolen the same afternoon it was recovered. Before leaving the parking lot, I made sure an officer wrote down what was mine in the vehicle. After a couple hours, me and my friend(the passengers) were released and no charges were brought upon us after it was all discovered that were were simply accepting a ride to the mall. Anchorage Police released said vehicle safety back to Enterprise employees with all its contents still in the vehicle. Here is where my issue arises. My BLACK PURSE, that contained my MAKE UP bag filled with KAT VON D, TARTE, URBAN DECAY.. just to name a few, my TOSHIBA LAPTOP, my OVERNIGHT BAG, & finally my purchases from NORDSTROM RACK in their respective shopping bags, have disappeared into THIN AIR. GONE. After October 9th, I called every car rental company in Anchorage until I was able to confirm it was infact Enterprise. Once in contact with Enterprise, every single employee did not even acknowledge a rental was reported stolen. Every person I spoke to, passed me off to the next, I explained what happened, that I didn't know who the original renters name or reservation confirmation number. We were only able to find it by the case number filing. And still, phone call after phone call, no one knows where my stuff is. It was discovered that the car was brought to a location for detailing, and after a phone call with them, they confirmed that my property was not in the car when it was brought to them, confirming that it was removed when it was returned to the Airport location. I went to the Enterprise location in the airport and they did not have it behind in the office. I was then instructed to go to the National Counter. I went there, no property in the back office. The employees contacted their manager, whom was busy and couldn't go look in their locked lost and found. I was given her contact information and to go from there. After emailing numerous times, I get a response telling me that I need the original renters name to go any further. After numerous employees exchanged all the back and forth with me, this Manager says I need the name, of someone I don't even know to go further. She doesn't even bother looking for my property. Someone has my black purse, overnight bag that had my make up that is expensive mind you, my new $300 Oral B Toothbrush that I only used ONCE, my laptop that I used everyday for work, that I have since had to resign from. That was my income for me and my family. $2700 a month gone. My clothes that I just bought, and Enterprise doesn't care. Where did my belongings go? Why did no one care? I was an innocent party in this whole situation. I am so frustrated and disappointed and disgusted in the lack of humanity and the amount of trust broken. I expected my belongings to be stored safe since I was not allowed to take anything from the car. Enterprise only cares about the money they get from you and nothing else. This company should be ashamed of themselves."
16930,Not busy get in get out
16931,"Great company. We had over 1000lbs of computers and monitors, and they helped us dispose of them! We will use them again!"
16932,I went here last night and it was great as usual. The service was quick and friendly. We got wings and some gumbo with corn bread muffins to go with. I am never disspointed going here.
16933,Steaks are delicious. Desert is to die for. Old school and super well known.  Great place to visit with your date or the family.
16934,Great place for kids to have fun
16935,"Nasty and over priced. They charged us $10 for a child's plate. Do not waste your time. Taco Bell has better food, if you can believe that."
16936,Never got a bad Sub at any store.
16937,This a great place to explore a less trodden part of Anchorage's woods.
16938,Upstairs seating
16939,Insanely good donuts
16940,Smells and looks old inside. Furniture and appliances are very very outdated.
16941,Totally delicious!!! Friendly atmosphere & easy to navigate web site for ordering on line or in store purchase with specialty items for Alaskans! Holiday items 😇😇
16942,Always fast and polite!
16943,Nice rink. Games are fun.
16944,Fun decent size and decently priced. I wouldn't go on a weekend but that's just me.
16945,"Food was good and had a good variety. Service was good as well. But I probably will not be back. I noticed after other patrons left, the salt, pepper, ketchup, etc. that's left on the table, didn't look like they were sanitised or cleaned in anyway. The staff weren't always wearing their masks in the back, but servers were in front customers. Also, every table was full when I left, leaving customers within 6 ft of each other without masks."
16946,"Fun place, clean lanes and tables."
16947,Employees had a good sense of humor. Very positive.
16948,Great
16949,Beautiful
16950,Great customer service
16951,busy place. super nice
16952,Wonderful activity to do on Saturdays and Wednesdays. I expected more variety in farm goods but then I think I was over expecting. There was a variety of vendors beyond produce from baked goods to flowers to home made items. Highly recommend.
16953,"This place serves amazing dishes. The service is always done with a smile and your experience you will remember, and want to come back over and over again. I highly recommend it..... 💋"
16954,They have been so great
16955,Modern hotel and friendly service.
16956,A regular McDonald's
16957,Beautiful place with a well kept trail. Fun for the family!
16958,I have worked with PIP in the past and have ALWAYS been thrilled with not only the product results but the overwhelming customer service. Each employee seems more than happy to help and goes above & beyond each and every time. Thank you for your hard work and for offering competing pricing among Anchorage consumers.
16959,"Beautiful store, friendly and Amazing staff. The environment is high end, yet fun and creative. Local made art and jewelry in various displays throughout the store. Highly recommend stopping in and seeing them."
16960,Good food
16961,"Pizza hut just isn't that great anymore. But hey, pizza is pizza eh?"
16962,The best place to go for amazing food and awesome outside entertainment  !!!!!
16963,Friendly workers and i enjoy their coffee
16964,Tried the reindeer pizza and it was amazing.
16965,Great oven baked pizza
16966,Great
16967,Always happy with my cuts♡
16968,"Lot better than before, still could use more funding."
16969,Not stocked during tourist season
16970,My stake was really small but cooked pefecet and the halibut was grate. Still want my stake bigger
16971,Great coffee and the owner and her sister are wonderful ladies!!!
16972,Real good food great service
16973,Great deals and selection
16974,Yum!
16975,Rude very very service
16976,"Food I have had mostly good, high priced"
16977,"Classic diner food, but fancied up. Definitely check them out!"
16978,Delicious made to order sandwiches!
16979,Not as great as it used to be..fun but didn't have alot of different things
16980,"A lovely little spot... just a few feet from the bike trail, heading either direction."
16981,The staff & techs are always friendly. Had a few problems here and there but nothing big or unforgivable. All the work orders we’ve put in were fixed at a reasonable time.
16982,The views while going up are wonderful.  But the views from the top are simply amazing.
16983,"Came home from work to a hysterically upset girlfriend, who told me she was robbed at Walmart.  The scam in question is a person asking to sell their Walmart gift card for a lesser amount in cash near the entrance and customer service counter.  Scam is potentially in cahoots with customer service employee who verified the balance on gift card at customer service counter but when used at Checkout there's a $0.00 balance.  I immediately returned to store to speak with manager who took our statement and advised us to file a police report. Manager made no attempt to question customer service employee or even inquire which employee was involved. Ultimately it wasn't their problem.   Guess what's not my problem ? Finding a parking spot at Walmart because I'll never return as a customer.   Waited over a year to get a reply or some kind of corporate response from Walmart.  Received nothing ! Walmart now receives nothing from me either.   Good riddance Walmart !!!  You've now become a lifelong boycott  of mine due to your complete lack of standards, unprofessionalism and below par customer service."
16984,"MAY 2021 - Just heard they updated the prices. So, the picture of fees is now outdated.
NOV 2020 - Went in this afternoon with my Mom. She had to get a few things done. There wasn't a line so there was no wait time. The lady that we saw was really nice and patient. It was definitely a great experience.  We were able to come in, do what we needed and be on our way."
16985,Love this place! Great food! Great atmosphere! I'm a regular there! The owner is a solid cat!
16986,"Not sure if it was the female stylist was new or the fact they aren't very good at fine hair, but my 11 yo son walked out with a Hack Job, which I didn't notice because they styled it with pomade. I give a great tip, as I mostly always do. I was furious the next day when his hair was washed and I could see crazy different lengths of hair... a mess!"
16987,Always great service and great foods
16988,Quaint display of old items and an example of how the road houses used to be.
16989,"So if you want quality outdoors gear in Ketchikan, this is the place to go. It is way overpriced but on an island they can do that. All of your work gear is here too."
16990,Fresh and delicious food served in generous portions. Enchiladas and carnitas both were phenomenal. I enjoyed the dry sense of humor the waitress had as well. Probably best Mexican food in area.
16991,"Chinese food is great, just wish they had more than one line when you call in to make an order."
16992,Love the kids options
16993,"First time creating an online account with this company. I'm waiting for the verification code to complete my login. It's been more than an hour. I've called the customer service number on the bill and it's hung up on me three times. Why is the rate going up and the service going down?

I received a response from Alaska Waste, but they didn't actually fix anything. The code that I ended up getting in my email didn't even work, so I still can't log onto the system. Also, what does the online service have to do with the phone hanging up on me three times after waiting through multiple people in the queue?"
16994,It's beautiful. I just can't deal with all the people.
16995,"Small i mean very small, but good customer service."
16996,Was hoping to see more flowers. Maybe went during the wrong season?
16997,Better than most fast food joints ..Amazing food usually doesn’t cost me more than 10 bucks
16998,I have no idea what is on the menu I just order and it's always amazing tasting.
16999,"Small menu, but everything on it is done right. Not one bad meal on there, and done with fresh ingredients."
17000,"Walked in, seated myself. Server was setting up table next to me. Other patrons walked in she proceeded to ignore me and wait on the ones that came in after me. I had to remind her that I hadn't been served."
17001,"Best prices for Dab oen cartridges!  Great service and I learned a lot about how they make,  them. Excellent counter guy he knew everything!"
17002,Busy around 4-6 but got in and out quick
17003,Basic diner-type breakfast.
17004,Pretty old place and needs renovation
17005,The Service Dept here is top notch.  I feel that Jake is always honest when he tells me what kind of service my car needs and doesn’t need.
17006,Excellent breakfast and great service.
17007,Excellent service and  great selection of fresh seafood. My husband's favorite steak in Anchorage.
17008,good food friendly staff. portions way too big!
17009,I forgot my mask and the counterperson fortunately sells a disposable mask for $0.25 so no fear!
17010,Super Campground
17011,Outstanding scenery and wild life viewing. The trail is well maintained with campsites and cabins available for rent. Watch out for bears!
17012,"A little pricey, but good product and excellent service."
17013,"Kind of expensive, but huge portions. Definitely better than the other ""Mexican"" options in the valley. We went for lunch and the small area for seating was pretty crowded, so get take out if you have a large party."
17014,A lot of sports goods 20% off
17015,"Kenny's Kitchen used to be good.  I got the Mongolian Beef and Fried Rice. The Mongolian Beef didn't taste right and they added way too much sauce, really soggy.  I paid $2.00 extra for fried rice that had no veggies or meat in it or extra flavor.  I won't be getting food from here again anytime soon. So sad!"
17016,"It’s a fast food place in the mall, top floor, food court. Elevator takes you to all floors."
17017,"The puppy package is worth it. My dog has stupid high energy and they're able to handle that without issue. The first two visits they managed him very well. The last visit he was straight out of his mind excited and wilding out in the waiting room so they took him back quickly and gave him his last shots so he wouldn't be such chaos for everyone. They know what they're doing, and we like them very much."
17018,Hands down the best burger and HUGE milkshakes
17019,Usually I get cat food and crickets. I'm in & out in 7 to 10 minutes. Sundays are always busy. Never a bad experience.
17020,The nicest yogurt place in Anchorage that we've been to.
17021,"Farthest northern Gift, Fabric & Fur Shop in the US, including Western Union"
17022,Go get a Butterfinger frappe.
17023,"Friendly staff, easy scheduling and great care. Dr. Gurr took the time to explain to me what was going on with my problem tooth and he offered a good solution with a next-day follow up."
17024,One of my must stop places when im in Anchorage. Always great food.
17025,Good service good food

17032,Excellent worship
17033,Great store fun to shop and walk around in!
17034,Delicious!
17035,Took care of me very quick and kept my car on the straight and  narrow of maintenance.
17036,Very professional customer service!
17037,Nice clean place. Decent food and the drink prices aren't bad. Especially if you consider you're in Dutch Harbor.
17038,Awesome service and the burgers are great !!!
17039,"Carrs , you name it 😎👍"
17040,"Such a classy place! Relaxing music, beautiful artwork, lots of seating, games to play, treats to be had, and coffee to drink! The barista was very kind and helped me choose what to drink. I decided on a Macha Latte with some Lavender syrup to sweeten it up a bit. Absolutely perfect and delicious!

I checked out the art while she made my latte. Found that they have several rooms you can sit in for more privacy or a quieter atmosphere. Overall, absolutely loved it here. Will definitely be back."
17041,"Only 5 stars if you dine-in and get the unlimited fries.

Usually call in and get take out. It's FAST - 15 minutes is on the high side to wait.

Almost should feel like I need to give it 5 stars, but I'm not.

If they advertised premium quality beef, like no-hormones/anti-biotics, etc, I would give 5 stars.

The burgers are always good. I've always slightly disliked the fries for some reason. They look like they should be good, but I find them too much on the mushy side.

None of the criticism prevents me from ordering and eating it."
17042,Parking lot is a Lake . My order had no bbuscuit. Called and did pick up. But meal was over and was missing something .
17043,They had the kitchen cabinets that I needed . But not very good customer service
17044,Pricey but good tour. Close to glaciers and saw whales. A bit too much beginning for tips at the end
17045,Live the burgers and am not usually a fry guy but I am addicted to the ones here !
17046,Really nice seats. Good quality food at the snack bar. Real butter for the popcorn if you ask.
17047,Limited lunch/deli sandwiches to go.  Gas pumps very very slowly.
17048,Luigi's Pizza has been one of my favorite pizza stopped since I was in high school there $5 take out pizza deal is out of this world make sure you call in advance so that you can just run in and grab your pizzas I haven't had any of their other food because their pizzas so delicious but I I would guess that it is also very tasty the gentleman that owns this establishment is very nice as well as his employees
17049,It was thirty below in the hollow but the dogs loved it. We had a blast on the roughly 30 minute ride
17050,Nice atmosphere great food the scallops and lemon spinach are awesome as well as the honey apple halibut. Wait staff very alert and helpful. Parking is sparse.
17051,"Love them wings! Its a hit or miss on service and wait times. They do have an app that you can order from and they do deliver! Good wing sauces, overall one of the best wing places in Alaska. If you like spicy, get the grim reapers!"
17052,Good pizzas and drinks.
17053,😊
17054,"Longest wait ever. Only 2 pieces of bacon on a 6"" sub???? Rude staff."
17055,"Great food and friendly staff. The view of the inlet, on top, is an added bonus"

17063,They never give me the correct order.
17064,All pet friendly
17065,In the heart of stewad nice contemporary hotel

17069,"Great food, beer and service"
17070,Good food great staff. Needs TLC.
17071,"Unfortunately, I've had to visit the ER twice this month but the doctors and vet techs took such great care of my mini doxie. They took the time to answer my millions of questions and I didn't feel rushed at all. Wait time for both visits took 2 hours, so bring a book and be prepared to wait, but that doesnt take away from the care the staff provided to my pet."
17072,"Went in to use a text coupon :
*Papa Murphy's: Buy Papa Murphy's Gift Card
valued @ $25.00 or more
& receieve 50% off your pizza.
Valid 12/22-12/24 *

on 12/24, first I was told ""no that coupon isn't good anymore"" then when we determined it was still active. I asked if I purchased a $25 gift card could I use it today and get 50% of my pizza paying with gift card. Was told no.

For the record I do love your pizza and am a loyal customer, but today was I felt like I was a burden and not worthy of respectful customer service."
17073,They were able to get the parts I was looking for sent up from Anchorage the same day. Decently knowledgeable staff.
17074,Dependable store with reasonable prices.
17075,Great staff!

17079,"Atmosphere is top notch, far above what I've seen from other vape stores. Juice choice was vast. Staff was helpful and friendly.....AND THEY GOT A DOG🐶! OH MY GOD. IS THAT DOG🐕 CUTE OR WAT. Also the chairs and tables are a nice touch💯"
17080,Great stop in the hovercraft...
17081,Texas Roadhouse was just wonderful as always servers are polite and efficient food was very good I will I wish that they were open 7 days a week for lunch but only on the weekends

17090,This store makes me want to be more crafty

17093,Nah
17094,Great
17095,"Due to COVID-19, there wasn't much to see..."
17096,Great playground for younger & older kids. Next to the bowling alley/ laundromat. Across from the library. Has a few picnic tables. Winter brings excellent sledding & ice skating. Best park in town
17097,"The spring rolls were very crunchy and tasty, along with the peanut sauce. I also had the Pad Pragow stir fry with chicken. Very good with plenty of peppers and onions. I had almost a full meal leftover."
17098,"Friendly employees, gravel lot, side by side sites close together."
17099,"Great location easy to access and abundant fish species i.e. King Salmon, Rainbow Trout, and Northern Pike. Every now and again you can catch a tagged Rainbow. The Lake is shallow on the East Side and deeper on the West side as deep as 30' I believe and on the East Side it hovers around 5 to 7' at deepest .Westside is mostly gravel bottom East Side is mostly grass which is where you will find the Pike"

17101,Great price and selection!
17102,Very good. Not top notch but very good.
17103,Calm place!

17107,Interesting historical displays. Spend most of a day touring the park.
17108,"My friend and I stayed here for easy access to the local anime/manga/video game convention, and the front desk was incredibly kind any time we interacted with them (And bless their hearts for not batting an eyelash when we wandered into the lobby in cosplay). Great pool, nice little snack shop and business center, and cool view of downtown Anchorage and the inlet."
17109,Worst place to stay in Prudhoe.
17110,Expensive but they treat you like roilty. Best experience in this field.
17111,Good sandwiches
17112,Great spot to see denali.

17121,Excellent food bank. Offers quality food. Always friendly.
17122,One of the best sandwich shops I've been to.
17123,"Ok so this is a tough review to write. I ate here just the other day and the staff was very nice and helpful in explaining the menu and the level of spiciness to expect. But.... they gave me FOOD POISONING. And I am 100% sure it was from here being that I didnt eat anything else the rest of the night. I am really sad because overall the foor was good, but I cant even think about their food now without getting nauseous. Sadly I will not be returning."
17124,"It says horn and antlers on the sign and they definately have a good selection of those, but where this place really shines is in its minerals. There are many rocks from around alaska here for sale so if you are a rockhound make sure to stop by! It also has a very cute gift shop to the left that his wife runs. All in all 8/10 could have had more rocks :)"
17125,Great food but a little pricey.
17126,Getting better every year
17127,"There’s a good variety of stuff here however almost everything we picked up was expired or about to be. Also, the prices are a lot higher than other Asian markets nearby."
17128,They say they offer alot but at so many costs
17129,Amazing coffee and fast service.
17130,Short drive. Beautiful scenery. Nice trails to walk for all abilities.
17131,"Little bit pricey, I feel like a trip to Texas Roadhouse would have been better 😁"
17132,Best pizza in town.
17133,Not very many shops!
17134,We had a great time. From picking the sushi to trying the Mongolian beef. We had a great server she was very nice and quick. It was a great meal
17135,Cutest shop. Delicious food. 1p/10 would buy again
17136,"This is a beautiful getaway! The room was comfortable. We took the Alyeska tram which  should be on every visitor's ""to-do list."" The only thing that was disappointing was the breakfast buffet. Spent $20 per person for cold, bland food."
17137,"Food was good, we sat on the deck. Service was a little slow despite only a scattering of customers."
17138,Had a good latte and a tasty turkey/avocado panini. They also make their own ice cream. Kids were swarming the place right after school then it quieted down and was a nice place to sit and read.
17139,"We often get pizza from here. The Greek pizza is the best. Delivery takes a while so plan ahead, but the food always arrives hot."
17140,Good price fast n friendly. Higher THC then most
17141,Great food great service great coffee

17154,Great service and good
17155,"An okay selection with a knowledgeable staff. This is a decent choice for your accessories, but there are better options in town."
17156,"Groceries, gas, propane, dump station, firewood. One stop shop."
17157,"I went there for the first time recently. The food was decent, but really over priced. The decor was beautiful and the service was amazing. If I could do 2 separate star ratings, I would give the food a 3 and the service a 5, but since I can't I met in the middle with a 4. If their prices ever get lowered I would give them another try."
