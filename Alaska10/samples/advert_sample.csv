0,my wife and i have had 4 different sushi rolls here and all were well made and delicious. the service here is great! The decor is very rustic alaska which does not give it an asian feel at all but they more than make up for it.

13,"Online hours said they were open, but they were not."
14,"I visited this place with a friend. The food was decent, the atmosphere on the off hours is nice, however the service was extremely slow. On the weekends this place turns to into a party more than a buisness. I would stay away from this place if you don't like the full party experiance and are willing to take that kind of risk."
15,Was good :)
16,"The service is friendly and the food is good, but very expensive for what you get. I've gone at least a dozen times and while I enjoy my sandwich, you'll get better quality coffee from an actual espresso shop. My last visit was by far the most disappointing, where my order was messed up and my Italian wedding soup was 95% soft gnocchi."

45,"I have never been so impressed with an automotive service company as I was with these people. Not only did they provide exactly what they said they would, they followed it up with a phone, and email to let me know what was going on, and that they were other issues that needed to be addressed and they prioritized what should be done first. They were great and absolutely great to talk with, I will be visiting them again."

68,Everything was fine
69,"For starters, it‚Äôs good to know that not everybody has had a bad experience with OPA. Dr. Kornmesser and Dr. Taylor were extremely understanding and helpful in making progress in my case.  Unfortunately that is where the fine care ends.

I have been trying to get treatment for my cervical and lumbar spine since May with OPA.  Overall this has been a 2 year ordeal for me. I have seen 4 separate providers in 5 appointments with OPA, with a 5 week break without any treatment due to an administrative faux pas.  A cervical MRI that was taken in February wasn‚Äôt looked at by a Doctor until late July.  That was Dr. Taylor.  I was finally seen by PA Glen, in September.  This was an appointment that I had waited months for.  PA Glen ordered a MRI of my lumbar, although he thought that it was nothing more than a back strain. The MRI was taken and I was given an appointment at 3:30 pm on
Friday October 13th, with PA Glen.  I arrived at my appointment at about 2:40.  If your not early, you‚Äôre late..  Although I understand that it was busy earlier, the waiting room had very few people.  Those that were already there were brought back to their appointments and arriving patients did not wait long to be seen.  At 4pm, there were just a couple of new arrivals and myself in the waiting room.  I went to check out.  The intake clerk wasn‚Äôt aware that the spinal clinic was running behind.  She called back to check on their status and nobody was there to answer the phone. That leaves me to strongly suspect that the spinal clinic closed down and went home.  I signed out and left.

I received a call at at 9:30 am on Monday October 16, from a young lady with great apologies.  The spine clinic was just so busy!  I was informed that there were a lot of people that need to be seen.  I understood, because I am one of them!  I was told that PA Glen couldn‚Äôt see me until Friday and that he was the only person that can read my MRI.  I informed her that was unacceptable and requested to be seen by either Dr. Eule or Dr. Taylor.  I was told that neither are here, and the only provider is PA Glen.  That to me is unacceptable.

From the information that I‚Äôve been given, it appears that PA Glen is running the spine clinic all by himself, and he only take appointments on Tuesdays and Fridays.  So far my experience has been like a game of kick the can, or in this case kick the patient.  I need to be treated and OPA has given me no choice but to seek treatment from another provider.  Based on my experience, I would tell anybody that would listen to stay clear of OPA.  The patient only equals billing hours!"
70,"Ambiance is great.  The place is a wooden establishment and has a scent of firewood, which I loved! The place cooks some of their food over a wood fire, which is SO AWESOME! My boyfriend and I loved watching the different foods cook.

Anyway, we were so full from our breakfast that we wanted to just get drinks so that's what we did.  We had the oatmeal stout, raspberry wheat, mai tai, peach mojito, summer sangria, and sweet tea all were soooo delicious! Also, saw on the menu that on Tuesday's you can fill a growler for $5, such an awesome deal!

Service was great with Jennifer at the bar seating."
71,Great place. Personnal take great care of the pets. Variety of foods for age range of pets.
72,The food doesn‚Äôt taste that great. Maybe my expectation was too high when I looked at all the photos here

75,"They had my brand new, spotlessly clean car waiting for me. Most of what they did at the counter could have been done with an app, but they were friendly and efficient. There was no sales pressure, just made sure I had what I needed."
76,Helpful staff. Most everything you'd need. They can also order most anything and get it within a few days.

In Alaska, Che sorpresa trovare una lattina di Medaglia D'oro Caffe' Espresso!"
86,"No frills, free, and they accept: cardboard, paper, newspaper, glass, bottles, aluminum products, tin/steel products, and plastics. Glad to have this place to not contribute all that to the landfill."
87,Very good customer service and the food was great.  I intend to go back again and I'd definitely suggest my friends to go there !
88,This is the best place for an MRI. They give you a lavender sleep mask to use and take home. They will play whatever music you like and as loud as you like with your headphones and give you some medication to help you relax!
89,Always helpful.
90,This place is awesome and cheap too
91,ordered beef teriyaki and the rice was soak with teriyaki sauce. Also Food portion is small and expensive. would never go back even if I live twice. Sigh....
92,Always fun times at Tudor bingo

97,Ronnie Sushi is always great!
98,The creek runs along residences
99,"IF they had crumpets, there would be five stars. Only english muffins. Gross."
100,I won't shop at any of the Anchorage Walmarts unfortunately due to the lack of security and carelessness of the employees. Too much crime in the area. Eagle River Walmart is much better!
101,Me and my husband needed to decompress and the tub and sauna was the greatest thing to do. We loved it.!
102,One of the best airport restaurants I've experienced.
103,"Awesome setting upstairs for a graduation party for a close friend.  The buffet was hot, plentiful and delicious."

111,Kinda pretentious and overpriced but the food is still pretty good and the view isn't bad
112,"Tori, the GM, and her crew are awesome. True professionals! Customer service like this is hard to find anymore. The best sandwich shop in Alaska! If you have never been there, you are really missing out."
113,Clean fast
114,"I'm pretty sure this place is a homer icon, but frozen burger patties is not ever the way to go. I'll give them one more chance for the ice cream."
115,"Older hotel but well maintained and updated. Beds were a bit firm but still comfortable. Individual thermostat in each room, so you can set the temp for what's comfortable for you. Actual 5-cup coffee pot in room. Bring your own coffee and small round filters and you're set! Bring a mask as masks are required!"
116,Great home town eatery. Customer service is awesome. Food is really good. If you are looking for catfish this is the place.
117,Good value for the money.
118,"Ok food, tastes like taco bell, but they have not once gotten my order right. This time it's one quesadilla instead of the two that I ordered (and payed for). And last time it was 5 drinks when I asked for 2."
119,"The only good thing to say about this place is the location.  Between Anchorage and Fairbanks, it's In the right place to stop, however, they take advantage of this...."
120,It's aight
121,"My regular place to shop is their local based competitor. However, they have comparable prices and items. Do you co- habitate with a house rabbit, Guinea pig, or hamster? They have a good selection of supplies, food and treats.

I was impressed with their cat litter packaging alternative. I have not tried it yet, but I believe in reducing my households carbon  footprint. I have found one brand that works for my needs and the needs of my cat and if this measures up might switch.
You buy the cat litter in a container on Your first purchase. After that you bring the container back and refill it!!!! Great idea for the environment and your pocket book.

Now if they open a location closer to a bus stop that would encourage me to visit them more. Knowledgeable staff and good productsüòâ"
122,"Love the prices, variety, quality & employees are great!"
123,I love this place no matter what time of year it is!  When it's off season you have tobwalk in from the gate and walk in which is cool too because you get to see parky squirrels and marmots along the road.  In the summertime it's cool to explore and take pictures in the old mine carts and walk through the little house.  It's crazy to think that this was once a bustling town and now it's one of the most peaceful places on Earth.
124,Its the bomb
125,Very old hotel but well maintained.
126,No one even care that we were there.
127,"We had a party of 12 and they were very accommodating, our server was very friendly and made sure we didn't need for anything. The medallion steak Alfredo was awesome, so was the rest of the food. But of course had to get more bread sticks to take home"
128,Great food and fast service. Professional employees
129,"I love 3 Bears, but the produce is always overpriced and it goes bad very fast."
130,Good
131,I feel a bit awkward reviewing a church but if it helps people find Jesus than here it goes. We tend to be ‚Äúchurch hoppers‚Äù we like visiting different styles and denominations of church to show our daughter the many different forms of Christian worship. This church is very modern and contemporary with a casual feel. The praise team is PHENOMENAL! They have complementary donuts and coffee and also additional treats and drinks for purchase at the cafe. Excellent children‚Äôs church as well. The only reason I‚Äôm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sermons can sometimes feel a bit phony or forced. I‚Äôve spoken with a few other people who also feel that one of the pastors tries to make himself cry and it feels forced and a bit awkward. But I still have enjoyed many sermons here. This is a come as you are church that welcomes everyone. Pick up a friend and check it out.
132,Great place for hiking.
133,Great customer service and knowledge of what your looking for. Thank you Mike for your help and will be returning to your store

179,Best prices
180,Very interesting things in this store. The people were very helpful.
181,"My kid had a ton of fun.  Relatively inexpensive play time for 20 bucks for an hour and he brought a few friends.  It was pretty clean and all the games worked, which most arcade type places seem to not.  Its been a long time since i last went, but they added a pause feature so you wouldnt waste the hour time limit when you needed to eat or take a break."
182,Clean place. Nice service. Smoothies are great. Not sure about coffee yet
183,The Carr's in the Northway Mall has bad Fruit Products and meat Products
184,"Very lack luster. I had ordered the new pub burger but when I got the burger I felt like they didn't put much effort at making the burger don't get me wrong very tasty burger but the quality of the burger just fell short for me the bun was really greasy, the burger looked a little undercooked,there was sauce but not a whole lot and the onion rings was crunchy but almost every bite just felt like i was eating onion rings and meat plus grease"
185,"Excellent food, super friendly staff."
186,It was wonderful very helpful. I really like this one and keep coming back. Because of the service i receive
187,"Extremely friendly people working here that are always willing to help and teach you wherever you're wanting educated on the subject. Anything from relaxing, pain, sleeping, energy; they're great at helping you find what you want and what is could be best for you. Definitely enjoy our trips over to see!"

189,"Service is spotty.  Obviously, it is expensive, but you could cook it yourself if you wanted to.  KFC gravy is amazing."
190,Decent food. Great atmosphere
191,"Service staff has no clue on what they are talking about, but they can read what the techs write down (theyre not bad), Sales guys (would never buy from them, but I definitely service my Ford here). GM is a real cool guy whos not trying to make a dollar, he does want your business."
192,"It's like eating at cafeteria with more choices, but you pay more"
193,Love the store but some of their managment needs to be let go because of poor attitudes towards the customers!
194,Great place to shop and hang with friends at McDonald's.
195,"Delicious food, always packed in season"
196,It's ok not in great shape anymore
197,"The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Viewpoint. I got a look at one of the world's engineering marvels.

You'll find info displays on the pipeline and an example of a pig, a device used to clean and inspect the inside of the pipeline.

It took 70,000 workers and $8 billion of investment capital to build the famous 4 foot silver thread that snakes its way through 800 miles of Alaskan wilderness to reach the nation's thirsty refineries, crossing mountain ranges, earthquake zones, permafrost, and rivers. Around 675 km of the pipeline is elevated (with 554 animal crossings), and outside Fairbanks is the place to see it. Every hour, more than a million dollars of black gold flows through it."

237,Have to see it to believe it

252,Food was cold when we got it and tasted mediocre.
253,O'Malley on the Green was awesome for lunch! Food was great and we dined on the patio!
254,"the only drawback to the moose's tooth is the number of customers that you encounter on every given night... but that goes to show how good this place really is. it is almost a must for visiting outsiders. and how the staff manages to stay friendly and cheerful with the crowds that they deal with is beyond me but much appreciated. it's just nice to have a local place that puts out world class pizza and beer, and you can be proud to take people to."
255,Smallest best buy in the world.
256,Owner is awesome and lanes are legit. They have leagues and a good bar with decent food. Would recommend for a good time bowling.
257,"I went to the store on Christmas Eve because my phone screen had broken. I understand that they wanted to get out of there etc however the lady that helped me was very obviously in too much of a rush. No, I didn't go right when they were going to close or even within an hour before. All she had to do was turn a new phone on for me. She actually said ""can you just do the Google part yourself when you leave? I don't feel like messing with it"". Well, to make sure that my contacts etc went thru and that everything worked right, you kind of have to do it when you buy the phone if you use Google/gmail, which I do. I know she was probably tired from christmas shopping etc but at the same time, I could have gone elsewhere to buy a phone. I could have gone and just gotten one of those ones from Wal-Mart. I chose to go thru this company, I waited at least 30 mins, I was also in a hurry and had tons of things to do yet the difference is, I wasn't rushing her or making her feel as tho she were bothering me. Bad move in a small store, in Wasilla, Alaska. Just so not cool! Good company, good prices on many things but this time I had very lame customer service."
258,Pipers has been my favorite pub and sports lounge for 30 years!!!
259,"Great place to rent a vehicle for an Alaskan adventure.  Place was supper busy as you would expect this time of year, yet Andre managed to make us feel as if we were the priority customer. This place is better than renting from the airport as it is more accessible, free parking, they wil pick you up if needed. Even received a follow up email ensuring everything was satisfactory a day after I picked up the vehicle.  Thank you team, you made the trip with the grandkids enjoyable.  We'll be back I'm sure."

263,"I want to love this place cause it looks like a classic burger joint, but the burgers are bland. It is hard to like something with no flavor. I ate a cheeseburger and a Buffalo Jalape√±o Burger both where bland so if you like a brand Burger give this place a try."
264,Best Pozole hands down
265,Love the remodeling they have done very nice
266,"This place is okay.  It's got some mileage on it and it shows in a lot of places.  Most of the machines are quarter munchers with little entertainment for grownups or teenagers.  For little kids?  It's a blast.  My kids love it as long as I have enough money for tokens.  The upstairs seems to have better games but there are still plenty of old ones that will take your token without giving a play.

They also don't serve alcohol here anymore.  Patrons can sometimes be a little sketchy.  Parking lot often doesn't feel safe.  Visits during peak hours should be the best times to visit."
267,"Always a super fun time.  While folks who are used to big city aquariums might find it small, it has enough educational value to be worth the price of admission."
268,Great place to eat in Seward! They were very timely and the food came out piping hot. Demonte was especially helpful and courteous. This place also has great tartar sauce!
269,Took my grandkids sledding and was great to see the joy in thier eyes.  Lots of fun. Will do it again soon.
270,"So nice, fun and professional.  Zip lining was awseome."
271,Beautiful forest area!
272,"Burger was good, buns should be warm not cold. Heystack onions we're also cold, rosemary coating overpowered flavor. Milkshake was divine."
273,"Great place to get a haircut, very friendly staff!"
274,What's on your list? You'll find it all
275,Very good toasted sandwich. I like that they are open. If only businesses were allowed to let me sit down and eat while my sandwich is still warm. It's very  cold and windy outside. Thanks for helping Nancy out with sliced bread.
276,"Great service, fantastic food."
277,"Good food, decent prices. It was uncomfortably chilly in the restaurant which dampened  the experience. But overall, worth pulling off the highway for."
278,Place is awesome an has awesome food... even helped suprise my wife for her birthday... if u havent yet... u have to go and eat there !
279,I bought a door to ship out of town and asked if they would wrap it up. Dan did a great job and didn't charge. I'll be doing more shopping at Lowe's than at Home Depot from now on.
280,Great store! Lots of books. Responsibly  price books.
281,"Excellent food as always, good service."
282,"Ok to pretty good, yet not really anything to write home about. Somewhat expensive, too (but not much more than average for eating out in Wasilla)... On the plus side, had a nice, friendly, and quick waitress ~ whose name I didn't happen to catch), :-)"
283,"That's been corrected; the park location has been moved across the street to the public parking area, and the names have been consolidated."
284,"Professional, thorough, Kind and helpful when I needed value estimates for insurance purposes."
285,I love Alaska Airlines and their service. My husband and I were treated very well on our trip to see our son and daughter-in-law. I'm more than highly satisfied with my service. I'm so satisfied that I cannot help but smile when I see the building
286,Too many empty stores and what is there is too spread out.
287,Best service in town. Food is pretty good too.
288,Very helpful people.
289,"Food, people and location just fantastic.  Thank you so much"
290,"If you're visiting Anchorage, put Wild Scoops on your ""must-try"" list. Wonderful and creative Alaskan inspired small-batch artisan ice cream. If you're a local, chances are you already know this and love it like the rest of us!!"
291,Always try to go here for do it yourself car wash
292,Awesome
293,"Food is a hit or miss, Service is a hit or miss as well. Always have some kind of issue when we eat there. The deserts suck."
294,It's back on campus and accessable to the public.
295,"We loved it! First time and I'm not real ""techy"" but managed to have fun, and get a small grasp of all the possibilities. My husband and took turns and watching helped to grasp concepts and take a little break. Fun and challenging. Thank you for great customer service and effective communication. Hope you will be opening up in North Pole soonüòÄ"
296,"Extremely overpriced for what you get!! $18 an hour plus you have to have their special socks, which you have to pay for! Very few places in the lower 48 have those prices and rules. The business is also not interested in helping local schools and churches. There are other, more fun and cheaper activities to do in Anchorage."
297,Nenana is the place to stop for refreshments and to eat! Alaskan history!
298,"Absolutely amazing.  I went on the 7 hour tour from Seward.  We saw puffins, SIX humpback whales, porpoises, bald eagles, sea otters, sea lions, seels, and other random things.  I have also been on cruises with this company out of Whittier and it was a ton of fun both times.  The food is great and you get way more than your money's worth.  Limited bar, but still good.  Cruise is super steady, very beginner friendly.  Bring a wind breaker for when you're outside.  Lots of fun, great for a family!"

348,Good area for kids
349,Awesome place to relax and soak your body.

358,Had an excellent experience! Great assistance and quality Service. Received valuable information regarding my purchase.
359,Food is not that good and to expensive.
360,"Decent spot. Love the history. And lots of good seafood options. Weird how they have a bar menu and a table menu that have different items, you have to combine the two to figure out exactly what you can order."
361,"Atmosphere is nice and the wait staff are friendly,  but unfortunately that is where it all ends.
Food is bland and greasy as to the steak I had, potatoes were cold and flavorless and oddly paired vegetables.
For the price I expected a lot better, guess they are catering to the tourists and not locals.
Their bread pudding was hard as a crouton.....should not be that way EVER"

381,I think this is where I would tell my family and friends to stay if they were coming here to visit.
382,"It‚Äôs still my favorite shop, the two employees Wednesday morning are awesome!
I reviewed the shop after two other employees had helped me with only 2 stars!
I hope their boss notices, I like other people will go where we enjoy going. This is an expensive luxury the experience is what sets shops apart."
383,"Outstanding customer service. This is also the place to shop if you have food allergies, alot of the products have very clear invreingre lists. The only downside is the confusing layout of the store."
384,It's okay  store but the parking lot is like ghetto. Lots of homeless people wondering around.

398,All the prices are bad and I tried getting batteries there and when I tried them they died immediately
399,Excellent food & service. Went twice in 2 days..
400,"Beautiful views, was disappointed by our actual meal. The free Tram Ride up the mountain was amazing. The restaurant is spectacular where it is perched and they have an amazing wine selection. Service was great as well.

Some of our food (Such as the Scallop soup) was some of the best I have ever had. Our cheese selection was lacking and our entrees were sub par. They called my steak American Wagyu but it was touch and chewy. My wife ordered the pork chop and our server warned us that it might come out as *medium* which my wife would have been happy with. The chop came out overcooked and tough. Both of our sides were lackluster as well. Some sort of beans came with the Pork Chop and my steak came with greens and quinoa, I had a tough time remembering what it came with and I was there a week ago.

Definitely worth a trip up the mountain to see this place, just be careful on what you order."
401,"Very good hotel, the best in it is the breackfast, good food, too much varieties, too much quantities."

I needed my tires inflated with nitrogen and 8 am, they fixed it with a smile at -15¬∞.

412,Do not waist your money on their lumber an forget about trying too order from the online site and picking anything up here in ALASKA .
413,I'll never buy wings anywhere else

Great for drinks tho!"

Wish the price could be less, negotiation didn‚Äôt get me far, but they have good quality trailers in stock, no waiting, and they handle the DMV work for you, so you‚Äôre paying a bit for a lot of convenience."
486,Very nice stay......
487,The service was okay and the food was good but not really worth the hour long wait after we ordered.
488,There the car dealers & service personals in Anchorage

492,Its ok

501,"Cashier asked for the ID before she started ringing up then before she scanned the Energy Drink she asked for ID again.  It's a shame it was an Energy Drink and she asked a grown adult for his ID to purchase Energy drink. Is there a new law to request for ID if you're buying Energy drink??? She said she was doing her job cause alot of kids are drinking it with alcohol. Well, I'm sorry but there was no minor with us, all grown adults. I think that was not necessary."
502,Best Mexican food in Kenai and Soldotna. Endless salsa bar üòã
503,Always delicious!
504,Nice owner and great variety also.
505,"üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé The prices are double any where else. I would rather make the drive to Wasilla from Willow to shop at Freddie's then go to the 3, three bear stores that are closer."

507,great place for a quick walk/hike with kids and pets
508,Love this place and great people
509,Beautiful park to go on a walk or easy to a hard hike. It is not as crowded as other parks in Anchorage. There is enough elevation on some trails to see a beautiful view over the city. It is easy to access and all trails are well marked and taken care for. Parking is free and also not busy. Highly recommend it if you want to be in the city limits but feel like you are not.
510,"Food, Customer service is pretty good. Pricy than expected."
511,"Great field (summer and winter). Kids playground, covered picnic area (SEATING! IT HAS SEATING). mass amount of field for sports, and fun activities."
512,"Surprisingly a great selection for such a small store. Meat department was too notch, produce was well stocked, and plenty to of other tbi gs to choose from.

They also had a decent restaurant area. It had a sandwich bar and a fried food section."
513,Helpful & courteous
514,Restrooms! But the staff at both Visitors Bureaux can be rather rude

518,They alright except they say dumb stuff the workers said they pooped them selves the cashier and stalker guy
519,One of my favorite shops! So nice and helpful and great prices too!
520,PMSI is the best. They are on top of everything and work with you to resolve any homeowner issue.
521,Burrito factory is an awesome place to get burritos from. They also sell Jalape√±o poppers with a cilantro lime sauce that is to die for.
522,Highly recommend getting your work done here gate bunch of people that in joy there job and are good at it. Feels like a tattoo shop not a ink for profit turn an burn place I'll definitely be going back time time again. thanks a bunch to them all and especially Danny for doing a awesome job on both my brothers and myselfs pice and making it a grate experience

525,You will wait for at least 40 minutes for food if you dine in. Just order out.
526,So I called in today to ask about snowboard binding parts because I recently acquired some that were broken. I spoke with a gentleman named Tom who told me no promises but to give it a shot. The team helped me find exactly what I needed!!! Shout out to the guy in the red shirt. You saved my day!!!
527,"Good food and service. Breakfast anytime, lunch and dinner items too."
528,"Love this place! great service, AMAZING coffee (thanks to Steam Dot) ambiance is very romantic and the food is great. My favorite was the cookies and cream, snickerdoodle dough and nutella wrapped in an egg roll, fried and it had a creamy sauce to dip it in, amazing!"

536,Great little store with a nice selection. My kid loved it!
537,Wedding party of 18 (automatic gratuity / taken for granted). SG works harder when gratuity is not automatic. We had a MUCH better food and service experience at Double Musky Inn.
538,Very professional vibe and decor. Always friendly staff every time I'm in there. And they have a rewards program!
539,"Food was ok, the service slow. People rave over their bread pudding, but must say I found it kinda dryed out and not up to par."
540,Staff is friendly. Dinner is better than average. Breakfast is top notch. The sausage gravy isn't the best but I have had far worse. If you need a decent cheap place to stay in Delta junction this is the place. The rooms aren't fancy but they are clean and cheap compared to other places.
541,Love their A & W Rootbeer
542,"It's sad that you don't get to choose your customer and I'm sorry that I'm not the type/color of customer you wanted, but my money is green, just like all other customers money! It doesn't look professional...did you really have to give me that look?"

561,Nothing beats getting out for a hike and taking in all that God's creation has to offer!
562,"If you're in Whittier, do yourself a favor and stop by for a bite! Halibut and cod are local and I'm sure other items too! Had the halibut and chips and wish I had 4 stomachs to try the cod!!"
563,It was alright
564,Good food store
565,One of Anchorage local night spot for dancing
566,Love this place. Not just good burgers but you have to try the Old Fashioned  onion rings as well. Love the creekside  seating  in the summer

569,Absolute junk  nothing works
570,It's fast and delicious. I'm pretty partial to going through the drive through but there is usually a place to sit as it's never crowded. Clean facility and friendly staff üëçüèªüëçüèª
571,Big rip off. Old outdated room. 75 dollars for cup of. Coaco
572,"Pita Pit is a good option on this side of town. However, the price is quite expensive. You are paying for the quality of meal, but be aware that $13 for a meal is what to expect. As for the staff and quality of food, I have never had an issue with it. The $10 student lunch special during the school year is what keeps me coming back during the winter."
573,Great pizza with a superb beer selection. Always friendly and helpful staff. Never had a bad experience.
574,Good food! Small plates enough for 1 person.
575,"Used to be a very nice place to grab some good Mexican cuisine, but Taco Bell is definitely better. Local Taco King in Anchorage have great Mexican cuisine."
576,Convienent location
577,"Ok so rant time. They tried to tell me they were out of strawberry mango salad but then another employee was like ""CAROL YES WE DO HAVE A STRAWBERRY MANGO SALAD"". Then that same woman had the AUDACITY to tell me they didn't have forks. I have her a dirty look and asked her to go find some and GUESS WHAT they found a fork. Oh also their chocolate frostys taste more like corn than chocolate /rant"

580,Has different thing you don't see in other grocery stores
581,"Pretty good, standard diner fare."
582,A great barbershop. Ronny comes second to no one with his hair cutting ability. There is another long standing barber that cuts with him and although Ronny is the only one that cuts me up he seems to also know what he is doing as well. Folks hair always look fresh after he cuts them. Ronny is the man! He always knows how to do my Fade! This isn't your regular barbershop!
583,"Good food, good atmosphere. Although they were busy, our waiter was very attentive. When they found out they were out of my initial order, a manager came and apologized and offered other suggestions. I loved the rib eye that I ended up with. It was very tender.
It was my first time going to a Texas Roadhouse and was enthralled when the waiters and waitresses started dancing to Cotton Eye Joe...I also got an order of bread to go because they were that good! (Coming from someone who can't eat gluten, that's huge! When something is worth the bellyache and the irritability and nausea that comes with it, you know it's good!)
Will definitely return the next time I'm in Anchorage."
584,"Food was fantastic,  everything.  Always the very best calamari,  pasta, dessert. Great food on an understated atmosphere"
585,"Fast friendly service,  although you now how to ask the cashier"

596,"Great access to trails, decent bathrooms, get an annual pass."
597,Very nice place for both Kodiak residents and out of towners!
598,It's a really nice old timey bar the food was surprisingly delicious I have the ribeye steak and it comes with breaded shrimp a baked potato with all the fixings and some bread and it was really really good I was pleasantly surprised the only drawback I would have is it is a little pricey but if you willing to spend the dough it's well worth the money
599,"A simply delightful and delicious meal that was expertly prepared in the kitchen and served by friendly, attentive staff."
600,"We absolutely love this place and their pizza is honestly the best in town. Always consistent, good prices and ready in 20 mins...even on the busiest days. Definitely recommend!"
601,I usually came here after my fishing trips or during winter when muddy snow hits my car. I still don't understand the point of coming here during winter as my car got dirty anyways hours after I left. But the car wash did it's job and cleaned almost all of the mud.
602,"(Translated by Google) Great museum. The entry was worth it. You can see a film of how the figures are made and then you can look at the figures in peace. Very cool! At the end there will be a small demonstration. So we were satisfied.

(Original)
Tolles Museum. Der Eintritt hat sich gelohnt. Man sieht einen Film, wie die Figuren hergestellt werden und kann sich dann die Figuren in Ruhe ansehen. Sehr cool! Am Ende wird noch eine kleine Vorf√ºhrung geboten. Also wir waren zufrieden."
603,This place is awesome. I highly recommend it. 5 Star.
604,Great brews and atmosphere! Never disappointed!
605,"Liked the selection of.rolling supplies and got a grinder that I'm in love with! They do seem a bit over priced on alot of their stuff, but other than that I liked my visit."
606,Ok
607,Excellent steakhouse to take a date to or treat yourself once in a while.
608,Decent italian food by Alaska standards. Waiter was attentive. Prices are average for small town Alaska. Great views. Is attached to the Best Western. Only open for dinner.
609,Holy cow they have a 900 lb. Addorable Sea Lion
610,"The typical old navy, but with decent social distancing"
611,If you're craving fried chicken then this is the place to go. If your looking for a variety of chicken meat to eat then head here. If your not in the mood for chicken then maybe head somewhere else. Good food but felt pretty bloated after.
612,"Decent food. Bustling place. Seat yourself... But it's hard to know that when you walk in, so there can be some awkward standing and waiting. Seems like a local dive. Can be quite busy with longer wait times for food. Last time our food was flawless. Warm, juicy burgers with crisp fixings. This time the meat was dry. Hit or miss in our 3 visits."
613,You know another Walmart same as the rest budget friendly all around items from housewares to hunting groceries to outdoors
614,Corn fritters were good.
615,"Convenient, and clean"
616,Itz good
617,Great customer service

620,"Every one I talked to was very friendly and helpful. Was able to add another vehicle over the phone, no problems. Thank you"
621,"It's spotty with other national franchises, but this is the better village inn in town. Food isn't all that tasteful, but the atmosphere makes up for it. When you can spend hours in a place visiting with friends and even playing jenga, while not blowing the bank, you have me sold!"
622,Has good hamburgers and french fries and good working skills
623,"There is no place on earth that puts me square quite like Denali National Park. If you are looking to be awed or inspired this is the place. I had read about the park before first visiting 25 years ago and, quite honestly, no words could have prepared me for the size and beauty I came across. Of course the mountain, Denali, along with the abundance of wildlife, are the reasons many people are sure to include the park in their travel plans when visiting. For me though, I‚Äôve come to appreciate the small rocks, abundance of mushrooms and wildflowers, the paths to creek beds and rivers and the sunrises and sunsets. While the Visitor Center and park services are open from mid-May to mid-September only the park remains open to a certain point for skiing and winter hiking...perhaps mushing as well (though you will want to check). I have it on good authority that March is an excellent time to visit is you are Aurora hunting. There is also a Winter Festival each year. In the summer season the area is hospitable to campers, hikers or those who want to bus in. There are several bus options. Cars/RV‚Äôs aren‚Äôt allowed past a certain portion of the road. The only exception to that is the annual lottery open to Alaska residents. Winners are able to drive the road with their own vehicles. It is an excellent opportunity and I urge all Alaskans to sign up online. Don‚Äôt miss this park if you‚Äôre visiting Alaska!"
624,"This is the best Burger King I have ever eaten at and I have literally eaten Burger King all over the world.

They're fast. The food is good. What else do you want?"
625,"Came here for our honeymoon!  Was totally surprised with a huge platter of berries and grapes.  In addition to complimentary decorative wine glasses.  A bowl of cherries and rose petals on the bed.  Beautiful deck,  swimming and fishing.  Peaceful.  Bears belly bbq restaurant,  which is on site, was a huge hit, off the hook,  great friendly service."
626,"So awesome, Hard workers and will not screw you over. Best of the Best. Bought two vehciles from here, Now i want my third one from here"
627,"Very good food, great art and excellent customer service. The pecan sticky buns are a MUST!"
628,Wonderful location great staff very family friendly
629,"Quality has EVAPORATED over the past few weeks.  Just paid $7 for an American ""Wagyu"" dog.  Also got a burger.  Pretty common order for me, maybe once a week since covid started.  Hot dog used to be premium quality, snap to it when you bit in, was a good size and flavorful.  My last two orders I got cheap, tiny grocery store hot dogs.  The buns were stale on both and the sauerkraut was grey.  The burgers haven't been much better.  Attention to detail has suffered as well.  We ordered a 10 pc chicken tenders and 5 sauces, one of each.  They just threw two mayo cups in with the smallest chicken strips I've ever seen.  Really disappointed at the decline. They were very good a few months ago."
630,Clean rooms.  Great location.  Beware.  $15.00 charge for parking.
631,"Great Chinese food, focus on that menu not the sushi one."
632,This place was very hospitable. They have free breakfast that makes the stay even more worthwhile. It was a grand experience for the price.
633,Ran down
634,"Phil and all of the guys at Affordable are awesome. Just bought our third car from them, and it's always a pleasure. Some people just want to deal with all the hassle of a traditional car dealership, and that's fine, but if you want a simple, laid back experience and a great price on a car; they're your guys.

Update: just bought our fourth car at Affordable. After shopping all over town, they had a great truck at a great price, and Brian was very helpful."
635,Smells terrible and unsanitary. Strange things go on here...
636,"Awesome service, busy busy busy at times..."
637,"(Translated by Google) The comfortable trail followed the wooden steps, and it was hard to climb to the top of the mountain. The wide 360-degree view, the snowy mountains, glaciers, and the beauty of the Butte Plain and farms make all the hard work worth it.

647,Had the Superman crew move a client of mine today and I have nothing but praise for the quick and efficient work they performed in moving out her belongings from her home to our warehouse facility. Very impressed by how smoothly everything went and I will definitely be using them again in the future for more client estate moves.
648,Great food
649,"Born and raised in Anchorage, but I've never even been inside of Peggy's."
650,Friendly people
651,"McDonalds opens at 7am.
They offer a full range of items from regular groceries, to clothes, electronics/entertainment, a well stock auto center, and well stocked home and garden center in the summer.
Usually enough cashiers to take of your your full cart needs quickly, and plenty of self checkouts to take care of your small loads on your own."
652,Convient location. Clean. Good food
653,"Slow, dirty and milk shake is emphasis on the milk! It was basically chocolate milk!"

671,"Exactly what you should expect from this chain restaurant. The service was quick, wings good, sports everywhere."
672,Take your money elsewhere. Was not contacted when my disabled Mother's glasses came in. After leaving 3 voicemail (because you don't get to talk to anyone) didn't even get a courtesy return call. Took off work and went there to discover they had been sitting there for no one knows how long!

678,Great food and fun for the entire family
679,"Soo slow, rude customer service"
680,"I really like the spicy pork bop.  It's different because no sauce.  However, the rice should be a bit less mushy and more al dente.  Texture of mush doesn't allow the individual flavors to pop in your mouth.  Simple fix. Will they listen to their customers?"
681,Beautiful brand new cars. Have you seen the prices lately?
682,"Absolutely love this place! The staff is amazing, friendly, great with kids, and very efficient at their job. The food is always fresh and hot. One of my favorite lunch spots in town."

685,"Walked into used the DMV services, girl at the counter very snooty ""We DON'T do DMV services, we never have. DMV is the only place that offers that, we are a driving school!"" Perhaps a little training on the business end is needed to let staff know what services offered, as well as some customer service skills. Horrible person to have on the front line of a business as it gives a bad impression and may not properly reflect your business."
686,"Great location right on the harbor with easy access to the rest of the harbor area with wildlife tours etc. Breakfast was included when we stayed,  the rooms were clean and with great views on the harbor side."

710,"First time ever going in to eat, I seriously dont know why McDs next door is always so packed. Was very pleased with flavor and portions. Onion rings are the bomb! Much better than their neighbor!"
711,"The pizza here is just ok, but it's the closest anyone will come to real New Jeresy/New York style pizza.  The prices are a bit steep,like everything in Alaska, but that comes with the territory.  At least the food is cooked in a real pizza oven, not on a conveyer belt through an electric toaster.  Pretty easy to find also.  They also serve a few tap beers and gelato.  I can't speak about the rest of the food, I have just gotten pizza here.  If you're in the mood for something closer to real thing, this place is it."
712,"Probably the best shop in town. He is honest, up front, and a very dedicated to helping his customers. Very Fair prices and exceptional Quality."
713,Their staff is knowledgeable and friendly.
714,I would come back to Fairbanks solely for this place.
715,"If you're looking for a large Mall in Anchorage that is expanding and has an incredible Theater then you need to visit Dimond Center.

The Dimond Center has improved the layout and the variety of stores over the years. The stores here are amazing and more popular stores continue to arrive.

When you consider the hotels and public transportation accessing the Dimond Center couldn't be easier.

If you need a dentist, gym, or ice rink you'll find them here too.

725,"I love the Double Musky Inn! It's a gem located in Girdwood. They do Cajun cooking along with great steaks. I have enjoyed everything I've eaten there, well-known for their pepper steak. They have amazing jalapeno cheese bread, which you can take home so you have room for your main course. My favorite part is when they bring you the dessert tray at the end so you can see how delicious your choices are.
The atmosphere is unique with beautiful stained glass and treasures everywhere to give you that vibe of an Alaskan hang out. The staff is super friendly and very attentive!
They don't take reservations, so sometimes you have to wait for over an hour, but it's definitely worth the wait! They let you look for an open seat in their lounge so you can enjoy a drink and appetizers, makes the wait time fly by."
726,"Don't wait that long, good enough service."

735,I cant believe this rates a 4.3 wow people dont expect much anymore...
736,"Bear Tooth is hands down one of the consistently-best restaurants in Anchorage.

769,Peter's is one of my favorites.  I love their lunch Bento box.  It is a great price for a lot of food.  The food is also very good.  They have free refills on non-alcoholic drinks which is also nice as some small restaurants don't offer such a service.  I always leave there full but not stuffed.  The price point is very reasonable and the staff is very efficient.
770,"Love there animals, service."
771,Generally competent and polite.
772,Good
773,It was so fun
774,Seems like inexperienced kids working here.

794,the worst over priced chinese food we have ever had avoid this place how this place is rated at 4 and a half stars must be a typo
795,Great seats except C5 in auditorium 2
796,"This is one of the best places to visit when in Alaska. Aside from a planned activity like snowboarding, paragliding, skiing and biking, which are great, you can also do a large variety of other activities like hiking, exploring, berry picking and just take in the beautiful Alaska mountains with a little experience of how it was to be a miner from the 1930s and 1940s. There is not much wildlife but it is there. I like to make this a half to a whole day event so bring some snacks or lunch. The dogs love love this trip also."
797,Great beer and the Ruben is off the charts
798,Not a large selection. Not a large store.
799,Nice store with a great selection
800,"Great, clean and secure!"
801,They have good stuff
802,Great food and all-you-can-eat bar
803,"The food was delicious, the common modified to take your expectations just a step off. The service was systematic and great,  nothing was left out.
I had a Rueben and soup, both were very good. The corned beef was soft, and the texture was amazing. The bread was perfectly toasted. The sauerkraut did not distract from the sandwich and had been portioned perfectly.
The soup had a nice creamy base, the dumplings were soft, and everything was small to accommodate all customers. Very thoughtful and safe.
The chai was pleasantly foamed, i did not expect this. I believe it was a modified Oregon chai. Again,  modified to stand out, but still near enough to the original to be familiar.
The fries were the most surprising to me. I'm not a fry guy yet these made me stop and admire them.

I would say overall this place is almost like visiting family after a long time. You've had the food, but this is slightly new.

I would return and still be surprised, happily."
804,"Love the vibe. Friendly staff. Great place to work. Highly recommended.Plus, excellent coffee and treats."
805,"Love taking my family here every weekend, we love the water slide, and I love the lazy river, and I expecially love the hot tub & sauna.üòç"
806,90% of the time they watch the wrong people. I can sit & pick the people off they need 2 b watching.

823,Great place for a quick stop for snacks and gas
824,Ok
825,"The staff of this store was very attentive and helpful when my husband and I recently upgraded our cellphones.  Julia was great to deal with and very helpful in making the transfers relatively easy....plus she was fun!  While there's always a little glitch here and there,  all went pretty smoothly.  We are both pleased with the products and services from Verizon."

873,This is one of our favorite dispensaries. We go there frequently üòÅ
874,It's a nice atmosphere but as clean as it looks it's actually not. I've watched the guy run his hands through his hair four times and immediately touch my pizza after without washing hands and the brush they use to clean the oven is literally sitting in a corner leaned against the wall. Giant beards and a lack beard nets. All and all I've seen worse but I expected better especially with an open kitchen. Not to mention the face touching in between handling my food. Sorry if this seems out of order I wrote it as it happened.
875,Govt
876,I love going to this place on the discount days! Always go here!

879,Excellent and diverse selection with all the latest and greatest options.
880,This place is absolutely incredible. Amazing detail in everything. Each time I've been I am pleasantly surprised by a new corner I haven't seen. Never never land is a kids dream room in the top floor and who doesn't like watching a movie in a home theater. Awesome place to stay!!!
881,"My daughter and I went there around 1 am after Christmas shopping. The food was terrible! I ordered a Rueben sandwich with fries, the bread was so soggy I could barely keep it around the meat, the fries were not cooked all the way, the hot water for our tea was cold, and my daughters burger was worse than a high school cafeteria burger."
882,Helpful. Relaxing. Peaceful.
883,Too many empty lease spots.  Don't waste time visiting
884,It's usually well stocked and 8 out 10 the employees are helpful and pleasant.

The rooms are small,but very clean,staff is always accomadating, and the food is excellent. I stayed there a month one time,and never had a complaint. Go check it out."
900,"IHOP is one of our favorite inexpensive restaurants but,  all of them could really use a makeover.  Standards are falling in cleanliness,  the fare and appearance/etiquette of servers."

902,Good
903,Friendly and helpful staff ensured my visit met all my needs
904,It's a nice park for our kids !

915,Best food in town and crew
916,"My favorite tanning salon in Anchorage. Been going here for close to 8 years I think. They have the best beds in town and believe me I've tried others. What a waste of time and money. Sensation has Top of line equipment and lotions. They keep their bulbs routinely switched out with fresh ones. Always doing great deals on minutes. I love the girls that work the desk. They are professional, kind and always helpful. The tanning salon is clean and comfortable. I won't bother ever using another place again."
917,"I like there egg, bacon & cheese bagel."
918,"Good customer service, the lot is a little cramped though and where to park your car can be confusing."
919,"Delicious food, meat from Indian valley, great brews. What are you waiting for?"
920,You can tell it was recently remodeled so it looks nice & clean. I just wonder how long it will last.
921,Doesn't clean very well. Cost too much for automated touchless.
922,I think the bed was itchy. I just removed the top blanket and it was all good.  But they have this wide land at the back where people played with the snow. Cute place
923,Some good pizza before I left Alaska
924,"Absolutely amazing, great people, great beer. A+"
925,Over priced. Didn't get the stir fried vegetables in 1 of my orders and almost all of it was fried lettuce... sick
926,The pizza is delicious!!! Plus the staff is awesome!! I've never had a bad experience with them.
927,"Great food, but the service is a bit slow."
928,"Food was ok, servise was decent."
929,Lots of cats. But it's pretty run down. The managment is always changing and the space rent increases probably 4 to 5 times a year. I don't personally live her but with family in the park I always worry about their safety.
930,"Staff is friendly, clean theatres, which is nice when brining your family to the theatre"
931,"I guess we were here.  I don't remember, sorry"
932,"Downtown, good food, and comfortable walk"

939,Great Hawaiian pizza and nice drink selection.  Really decent and I will make a point to eat there again.
940,Simply breathtaking views of one of Alaska's glaciers! You even get to fill up your own bottle with the glacier water. It is plenty of fun. I highly recommend this glacier for adventure seekers like me!
941,"Much improved since I was there last year. Quit going because I couldn't hear anyone talking. Now not so extremely loud. Audio boxes are tableside for listening to any games on the TVs. Food was good. What I expected. I'm personally on a restricted medical diet, and found plenty of good options. Service even also improved, but it was never an issue for me anyway. Just nice to see. May be better off with a bit smaller menu, and changing it up some seasonally. Not uncommon, probably just a thing for me."
942,Margaritas were great!
943,Family time and celebrate a birthday
944,Good food and service!
945,Good service
946,"Fast service, felt welcomed, very delicious food"
947,"The rooms and staff were very nice, but the main reason we rented here was to use the pool and hot tub. The pool was ok, but the hot tub had visible slim/mold caked on every corner. I was disgusted and we didn't go back in the pool area at all after that im pretty bummed me spent over 300 dollars for our stay and didn't get to enjoy the pool area. My son had alot of fun in the jacuzzi in our room.
I did notify the staff about the situation and I got fed a bunch or excuses. So I checked online reviews other than mine, and this issue was brought to the attention of the hotel staff 2 weeks ago but is still not been resolved.
I will not be staying here for future special events. I am a local and because my birthday is during the cold season we usually rent a room somewhere around town.
I understand pool and hot tubs are expensive to maintain but the water shouldn't taste like salt or hurt eyes when you come back up from swimming under water. Lastly when I asked later on about the pool being cleaned the women at the front desk told me ""I sent the maintenance guy to wipe that off the walls."" Only to wipe it off the walls not to actually clean it. I lived in the lower 48 for years and rented hotels down there. Even the cheapest motel/hotel hot tubs are better kept than this one.

Update: The general manager is no help at all!! I called to get a refund and they said they would give me money back for one day I was ok with that, until I looked at my bank account and noticed the hotel took out another 155 dollars. I called to have it corrected and the manager told me to quit yelling even though I was not. I have a clear speaking voice and was upset, but I didn't yell so of course it made me get upset when he kept being unreasonable.
He automatically got an attitude with me and was absolutely no help and was acting very petty and snippy. It's like he was trying to have a pissing contest when I just wanted my money back the hotel wrongfully took from my account.

I feel like this company specifically targeted me because I wrote a bad review and wanted a refund. I will never stay at a Hampton in ever again due to the unprofessional actions of the general manager.

He definitely needs more training on how to handle high stress situations with customers.
He kept interrupting me to give me excuses in the middle of my complaint rather than actually trying to solve the situation, and kept telling me to call their 1800 number because he couldn't help me if I didn't want help.
Then he had the audacity to laugh at my situation like it was funny that I couldn't buy food for my familt due to his employees mistake.
I called multiple times throughout the day to try and have this issue resolved and the manager never called me back or spoke to me himself until they processed the money out of my account. He had his assistant manager do it.

When I first called to let corrin know they took money out rather then putting it back in specifically requested to speak with their accounting department or the manager. She told me she would handle it and it was not handled.

I may sound lie a bro ken record, but I do not want other people to have this issue happen to them either so I am filing a report with corporate.

Corrin was helpful it was the general manager who was no help and just down right rude. I called to be helped not get into a pissing contest with the person who was supposed to be in charge."
948,"Great atmosphere and good food. Had the Alfredo fetticini with shrimp, but wish I had a bigger portion of pasta based on the price they charged."
949,Helpful employees
950,"Andy and Dottie are awesome! Very patient, helpful, friendly, knowledgeable. Great customer service! And they had all the gear we needed. Thank you guys. :)"

953,Can't wait 2 go back I miss Jeff so bad. Thank u for an amazing time
954,Crazy busy in here but great prices!
955,Very clean set up. They listened to what I wanted and and completed the art work.it looks great and I love it. I think it looks amazing!
956,"Lots of fun stuff for kids to do. The cleanliness was a little to be desired. There is a climbing wall, a vet center, a microscope, a piano to play on, art center, building center, a toddler section, plus more! Some snacks available and they also have a section for free books."
957,Great place to have a family that respects the wilderness.
958,"OMG!  This place is amazing.  There's no doubt they put out more pizza than any other single location pizza joint.  Trust me, you'll want to stop in.  I suggest you order to go and pick it up.  This place always has a LONG wait time."
959,Best donut shop in town!
960,"Took 15 minutes to make one small sandwich because they served the two that ordered after me first...on top of that one small sandwich cost $9, not going back again."
961,"Gave me a great shape up, best ive had since in Philadelphia! Nice establishment n makes you feel comfortable. Only go here now"
962,Great service and down home cooking
963,Fantastic!
964,Love the various options for wing flavor!!
965,"I have always had great service both at the Eagle River shop and their Anchorge shop. The Eagle River shop has taken their time to help me out with some minor fixes, such as once I had a rock stuck in the brakes. I had no idea what was wrong and it made such a racket. Zach took my vehicle right in, they took the rock out and sent me on my way. The last time Mark was super busy but took the time to give me an estimate of what the problem was and what I should do. I appreciate having a local shop that believes in great service."
966,Friendly staff. Good location. Nice room with a view.
967,"Friendly staff, nice screens, clean."
968,Love brown hug
969,Nice.  Pretty clean.  Water not too deep for kids.

971,"Good, touristy Alaska stuff"
972,"Oh heck, this place is to die for! Anything and everything is superior and so worth the wait. They even provide self serve coffee while waiting.
Just go.
There will only be happiness, as a result"
973,I love when I bring my dogs in there they always have such a fun time and it never fails they are loving everything and pick out way more then I planned on spending lol but there totally worth every single penny and experience
974,"Really nice ambiance - there are long counter height tables, small cozy tables and big, stuffed leather chairs. In addition to a variety of coffee choices, there are pastries, yogurt & granola, carrot cake,  cookies and sandwiches. A very nice place to relax and take a break or escape from the constant interruptions of the office."
975,Its nice when theres not a lot of people trying to compete with your conversation
976,Needs more employees.
977,Not a place to go if you have friends already there. They will not accommodate you to sit at one of the five empty tables next to your friends. Bring a light to read the menu as lighting is very dim.
978,"I came down to Kenai to celebrate my graduation and decided to eat out at this establishment with my family. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the server proceeded to come back with just spaghetti. Without making a big deal out of it, I asked politely for my delicious balls of meats that I so ever craved. Instead I was shafted with horrible customer service when the server accused me of lying about my order! Not to mention he forgot the garlic bread which was supposed to come with the meal! Poor customer service! Plus the spaghetti tasted like it was made in a prison."
979,The best Asian cuisine ever!
980,Easy in & easy out.....you do everything right there at the pumps
981,I'll be back!
982,Great food and atmosphere. Great place to take the kids

986,Excellent service.
987,Excellent.  Just stopped in to get a license for my dog at Juneau Animal Rescue and the whole transaction was smooth and expedient. Excellent services.
988,Normally I love it there and great menu. My recent visit in December  was tough as not open like usually is for meals such as lunch and dinner..having hard time renewal of liquor licenses as new owners..hopefully gets resolved for the upcoming season
989,Not many shops in this mall
990,awsome
991,i work at the Dimond Center Hotel and I always send our guests to this place they always come back full and happy with nothing but good things to say about suite 100 thank you for being good to our guest i will have to stop by and check this out thanks again. Supervisor of the Dimond Center Hotel otilla

998,Excellent food and staff. Don't let appearance fool you.
999,Ok
1000,Nice folks
1001,"Glen square is a hidden jewel. Bass store. Micheals, Cupcakes. Xhalos Mexican food., Burgers. Italian, Schecter shoes, Mattress store."
1002,Always delicious. Friendly staff.
1003,Great service!
1004,Tiny rooms. No AC in room so you'll need to leave the sliding door open for any air. We had to deal with the ton of road noise and 17 hours of light to keep cool. There are almost no horizontal surfaces in the room to put things on. Bathroom sink in hallway is so low it could be an end table. Tiny TV. Deck with overgrown bushes yielded no view and a herd of no-see-ems. Formica like walls. All of the conviences of 1980 with Wifi. Outdated decor and worn interior. Excessively average for an above average price.
1005,A most enjoyable evening. Enchanting
1006,This is such a great place to eat at!
1007,Fantastic food.
1008,A great barbershop. Ronny comes second to no one with his hair cutting ability. There is another long standing barber that cuts with him and although Ronny is the only one that cuts me up he seems to also know what he is doing as well. Folks hair always look fresh after he cuts them. Ronny is the man! He always knows how to do my Fade! This isn't your regular barbershop!
1009,Great place to fly a drone in get footage if you get the permission
1010,I bought my wife and sewing machine  Customer service is OK a little spendy there but it's good place to window shop
1011,Very good sandwichea.  Always fresh bread and the meatball sandwich is fantastic.  However wait can be long at lunch and rumor has it the owner is shady with the tips
1012,Love the fresh produce
1013,Sears and BURGERFI are good stores to visit reasonable prices and good parking
1014,Amazing
1015,"Nice room on the 3rd floor, had a decent stay."
1016,Get the calamari
1017,"The best place for outdoor gear and clothing. Awesome decor, and friendly people too!"
1018,Nice place to get a good view of Denali on a clear day.
1019,Really good food for under 10$ with a treat  I tried the triple chocolate brownie  te other day it was good.
1020,Great dining option in Seward.
1021,Breakfast or lunch this is a must try if you are visiting. Located in the heart of homer Duncan house is a staple. From the Bud breakfast burrito to the full sail even deckload hits the spot every time.
1022,"I've never had a poor experience here. The food is great. The atmosphere is fun. They are always playing movies that I never had a chance to see in the theater the first time around. My only complaint is the limited space to ""stand in line"" while waiting for a movie to be seated. You can get there an hour in advance and still end up standing outside in the cold for 45 minutes due to the place only having the capasity to stand 30 or so people inside the lobby. This would be a 5 star review all day aside from that."
1023,Huge menu. Great food.
1024,"I do like their Italian BMT toasted, and the people are very nice. However they could do alot more to separate themselves from every other sandwich shop. Side note;
The sweet onion sauce is delicious."
1025,"The pizza was great, the seating outside was beautiful. Good selection on beverages and appitizers. Will be going back for sure."
1026,Food is always great the service is always friendly I dine here often
1027,Fast food but employees actually seem happy to work here! Great atmosphere. Glad they made it so far north!
1028,Terrible food.
1029,Just delicious!!! Crepes in Japan cost only half of this place but I'll take it! I do wish they were a little more consistent though.
1030,What else is there to say? OG is always good! The curbside pickup was easy after ordering online and the food was hot!

1034,"went in for my birthday gift and my daughters 1st pair of shoes as she just took her first steps. unfortunately they smallest size was a toddler 6. shes a 4. so I settled with it as she'll grow into them. my issue which was such a met down as i fell in love with a pair of shoes  . the display sign dead 49.99 and the only pairs in store in my size was the display shoes and at the very tippy top shelf. when i was checking out I noticed my total was higher than what I thought.  99.99 versus 49.99!
he went and verified my price and said it was in the wrong place.

I really really wanted them so , sure I was willing to spend more. though  I said it was the stores error and they should honor the price posted with the pair I wanted.  the customers was right and  when I worked retail years ago ,they were right and we honored it.  I noticed the iridescent logo of the shoe was scratched. there is not a way to fix a thick scratch so he got the pair at the very top and the fabric was fraying like it got caught on something a small tear. so I mentioned a possible discount for a damaged item. he said they cant honor the 49.99 nor discount the shoe. ugh I was upset at this point. the other location was closed and I went with a similar shoe and guess what. not in stock and he was getting frustrated and the other gal as I was asking for too much.i just bought my babys shoes and didnt bother getting anything else for their bogo sale.

that will forever be engrained in my head I was soo excited and felt like a kid that was told no candy in a candy store. lol"
1035,Nice place üëå food is awesome üëç
1036,I recommend sneaking in snacks üòÇ
1037,"Got my iD fast by nothing but knowing my social and birth place, so i give them 5 stars"
1038,It's a great family oriented park. Bathrooms get kinda skanky but lots of fun things to do.
1039,Food good.  Customer service is very good!
1040,It's a waiting process but it's alright.
1041,For the students it is the best place to  study and have coffee. Plug in for laptops and phone.
1042,"apart from the rain, it was pretty nice"
1043,Good food. Great service
1044,Not really much for trail or anything except fishing and boating.
1045,"Odies has ginormous sandwiches for a pretty penny and cookies larger than most infants' heads. They're not bad tasting by any means, just a little too pricey for my taste. They also have live music some days and trivia night every Wednesday, if you're into that sort of thing."
1046,"The park was beautiful, however none of the buildings were open. Not even the bathrooms."
1047,Walmart sucks.
1048,"Awesome food, fantastic staff, clean and fun atmosphere"
1049,Nice clean place and service was very good. Polite friendly servers.
1050,Need friendlier staff.
1051,"Amazing artisan pizza - both classics and seasonal options, plus a good variety of beer! Always a good pick :)"
1052,Absolutely amazing
1053,"It took 5 min to sit us. 5 min for the waitress to show up, and 5 more min before she brought us water. We asked about beer options and tried to order BUT...we were denied alcohol sales because one of the driver licence's was the old fashioned portrait style.

My lincence is NOT expired, but is so old that it is grandfathered in! It was issued after I turned 21. Before they were landscape oriented. Before the 30 day rule. And before the blue stripe law. I know that a lot has changed since, but its GRANDFATHERED in. Every DMV office in AK has an information flier about this issue. And no, I will not go waste an hour of my life and $15 or $20 for a new licence if my current one is valid. Thank for wasting 30 min of our time.

You have lost my business indefinitely"
1054,"Wholesome food.  Whenever we decide to eat out, this is usually the first or second choice.  Middle Way Cafe wins if it is during their Happy Hour (between 4-6pm daily).  Organic Oasis serves food I feel good eating and feel better having eaten.  I feel very welcome here and plan to keep coming as long as I live."
1055,"My son took his flat in to be repaired, they did not do their due diligence, when they put the tire back on his car after he paid, his tire went flat less than a block away, they charged him to put his spare back on, when we called them after he got home, they were argumentative and blamed my son saying he had to have hit a pit hole and caused damage in that block of driving (he didn't)...my family, and friends will never go there again.  I've been in customer service my whole life...this is not how you should treat customers if you want repeat business. Horrible experience!!!"
1056,Good food good service
1057,"It's a grocery store, not a great one but not to bad either"
1058,"Took my cat there due to a bladder infection resulting in him no longer being able to urinate. The vet was quick to diagnose the issue and he was admitted immediately for anesthesia and a catheter.

They took excellent care of my baby boy and he was able to come home the next day feeling like his old self again.

Staff are friendly and knowledgable and if they can't answer your question right off the bat, they are quick to consult and get you the correct information.

Highly recommend and will continue with them for all of my animals."
1059,great
1060,Found all the things I needed to make dinner. ..great place! Love the thunder an rain effects in the produce section

1062,Friendly people willing to help
1063,"Not the best selection, but the staff is helpful and can usually get what you need."
1064,Great food. Wonderful hospitality. They let me use their wi-fi when my vehicle broke down so I can do a conference call.
1065,"If you want any plumbing or heating work done in your home, I highly recommend the Beckley's team. They worked on our house's plumbing for a bathroom remodel and replaced our old oil heater with a gas furnace. Couldn't ask for a better team, quality, professionalism and a more knowledgeable team. Outstanding service, great people."
1066,Amazing place would definitely recommend this place to stay for the night
1067,Nice community park.
1068,"Love the store. Electronics are up to date, as well as fashion and houshold items."

1073,Good little store
1074,"They have been changing my wife's oil, and using the wrong filter.  When I brought it to their attention, they said they would talk to Ford about what could have been damaged.  No communication from them since that happened, over a month ago. Ridiculous customer service."
1075,"Smashburger is a healthier creative alternative to your typical burger joint. They aren't the heartiest burgers, but they're very customizable. They have Udi's gluten-free buns and avocado slices. I really enjoy their smash fries and tots.

I'd highly recommend downloading their app and scanning in your receipts. The rewards you get pretty much make up for the premium price of the meals, so it evens out in my mind. It's better to order as a couple or family rather than individually as you'll rack up points more quickly and most of the rewards are Buy 1 Get 1's.

The food isn't as messy as getting a low-carb lettuce wrapped burger from Carl's Jr. The staff regularly clean the tables and you're not required to take your own trash. The staff is always friendly, not just here, but even the locations back east where I first became acquainted.

Their shakes are fantastic!"
1076,"That morning crew during the week is amazing.   Really good customer service, really attentive to your order.  Palmer perk up is by far my favorite now!      I love you guys ! Thank you for keeping me alive !

That Guy"
1077,Great!
1078,I had the Krabby grilled cheese with clam chowder and it was awesome!! I'll definitely go again!
1079,The coffee shop has a friendly attitude in it's customer service that I would give kudos on. But the only knack is cash only. üòÅüëç
1080,Ice art festival 2019 was okay. Ice sculptures were amazing as usual but the event keeps getting smaller. We were just frustrated that we paid all that money and they didnt have the slides finished. What a waste of money. Call ahead if you have kids and want slides!
1081,Best place to get prime beef in Alaska.
1082,A little expensive. But I guess the selection is slightly better.

1092,"Located near Westchester Lagoon, this little shack offers drinks and snacks for the resting hiker, biker, jogger or family. Playgrounds for the kids nearby."
1093,The first time I went the food was good. It was hot it was fresh it was great. The second time I went they messed up my complete order I wanted a queen tostada and I didn‚Äôt even end up receiving it and did not realize it until I got home and I told them I only wanted the enchiladas but I ended up paying for the entire meal that I did not want and I got an extra order of rice and beans that I did not order. Will go back because the food is decent however make sure you have what you ordered before leaving the property
1094,OMmmmgoodness! The onion was delicious! First one I had! Staff was great! A bit too much salt and pepper for my taste buds in cooking.

1104,"I honestly went the first time because of the 10 dollar cut but I come back whenever I can because the people are so great.  Good prices don't hurt, either"

1106,Cops looking for someone
1107,Epic

1122,We stop at the Lemongrass Thai restaurant almost every visit to Fairbanks. It is our first choice and we are never disappointed. Great food and friendly service!
1123,"Wonderful old church, improving grounds around.  Only slight problem is parking."
1124,Best dang BBQ this side of the Pacific! Love the brisket the best!
1125,Very detailed with alot of information. Site is easily navigated.
1126,High prices for a junk yard
1127,Taco Bell food with friendly service. Crew was a little rambunctious but I can appreciate their energy.
1128,"Staff is always helpful and kind, great product and the prices are the best I would say for concentrates. One of if not the only place I'll go to out in the valley for smoke."
1129,"My wife loves it and they keep my Malia looking great and healthy
I followed the staff here from a salon  they had run and owned before. The  staff are topnotch"

1140,Nothing special. Adequate.
1141,"I was looking for probiotics yogurt drink for my son, found it."
1142,Best Chicken Waffles in Alaska! Joyfully appeased my Roscoe's Receptors ;)
1143,Best pizza i ever had! They also have a great salad bar. Not very expensive. The look of the place does not give any hint of the food they serve. Friendly people as well. Pizza reminds me of what you can expect from Bucha di Peppo's

1147,The servers attire is suited to the Saloon
1148,Offers all the shops a large city has to offer!
1149,"First floor is to smelly, bad ventilation and carpets are to smelly. And yes they would do your room , change your towels ,empty trash on the eighth day of your stay."
1150,Cute small park with a possible entrance onto the flume trail.  They also just finished building a little section of the park into a mountain bike track.
1151,"Great location. The beds were comfortable and the comp. breakfast is pretty good.  We were there on a smokey time, but the lake should have great views most of the time. No elevator or a/c."
1152,Great food and service! Got to check it out.
1153,"Give it credit, anyway we can clean up Mountain View, whether it is neighborhood renovations  or washing cars, it is a good thing!"

1160,Learn more about the marine refuge every time I visit
1161,Our toddler loved seeing the moose so close!
1162,"No less than 5 employees walked by us before one acknowledged that we hadn't been helped. He never came back with coffee. The next guy  (10 minutes later) finally gave us menus and took our order. 30 minutes later, no food, no coffee, nobody to be seen. Food finally comes and isn't the way I ordered it, I ask them to fix it, they said we are out. It happens but don't expect me to eat it just because you messed up. No thanks. I've been in the food and bev industry for 16 years and this is the first time I actually considered stiffing a server, instead I just left the untouched food and walked out. No thanks. Terrible service and terrible experience. I'm sitting at my hotel now starving because I'd rather be hungry than eat there. If that tells you anything, don't go here. Pricey too, even for Southeast Alaska (we are locals)."
1163,Great place to meet friends and watch sports
1164,"The two new sculptured panels have the theme ""Given...by the Great Land"". These are solemn artworks which flank the USA flagpole and the memorials to the Alaskan military who have paid the ultimate price in their service to the country.

The North Panel. ‚ÄúReflections on the Great One‚Äù is 8 feet high by 20 feet long. Constructed of stainless steel, aluminum and granite with stainless steel mesh and bronze elements. It is meant to be viewed and touched from all sides and is subtly lighted with 13 lights. The 13 panels of mesh and granite create an abstracted view of the iconic image of Denali ‚ÄúThe Great One‚Äù. Sculpted in bronze, an Honor Guard‚Äôs arms release an eagle that flies toward the summit. The symbolic elements in the sculpture include:
--Honor Guard and Eagle Release ‚Äì the soul of the Veteran flies to the summit of Denali--
--Mountain showing the strength of Alaska Veterans--
--13 vertical columns representing the stripes of Old Glory--
--Missing spaces for the lives Given by the Great Land POW/MIA--
--Mesh is the strong fabric of our military men and women--
The POW/MIA flag flies over this sculptural panel.

The South Panel is ‚ÄúO‚Äôer Land and Sea a Beacon Bright‚Äú shows an abstracted ocean vista constructed of granite slabs with linear cliff forms on the mesh. In the center, the beckoning Big Dipper stars, the Honor Guard Bugler and the Presentation Flag provide realistic touchstones to this monumental artwork. The symbolic elements in the sculpture include:
--Folded Presentation Flag for the Fallen Warrior--
--Bugler plays the 24 notes of TAPS--
--Eight stars of Gold for the Big Dipper in the Alaska Flag and the Gold Stars Moms--
--North Star is the guiding light that brings the fallen back home--
--Mesh is the strong fabric of the military in our state and country and is a place to leave reminders for family and comrades.--
The Alaska State flag flies over this sculptural panel."
1165,"I paid for a 80 minute deep tissue massage. I time my massages, the massge was only 1hour. They shortened it by 20 minutes. This is not the 1st time either. So if i were you, time your massages. Also, It was not deep tissue, she only did it medium deep on my back the the rest of the massage was something my husband could have done at home (when he's lazy). Not very happy with this place."
1166,"I like the variety of stores, but the layout of the store is pretty confusing."
1167,Had all my provisions!
1168,"Professional attitudes of serving customers.
A place know how to fix cars.
Free rides of driving customers home and picking up customers back to store after car is fixed. I will recommend this place to others."
1169,"Best sandwiches in town. And cookies. And soup. Really, everything is great. Never been disappointed."
1170,They do a good job and no surprise when it is time to pay. Just as they said.
1171,"Typical tourist items...t-shirts, etc. Nothing to rave about."
1172,"This used to be one of my favorite places in Wasilla, until today. What a huge disappointment! Mushy noodles, black over cooked meat, the egg drop soup was like cough syrup for christ sake. Thanks for F'ing up my lunch experience Kings Asian, way to go!"
1173,I found it a bit different the staff ignored me standing there .. a customer made it obvious I was in the way of their conversation
1174,"They are so nice awesome and accommodating!!! So happy I stumbled across this new restaurant online.  They have several unique things.  FiRST TIME I have ever had REAL wasabi unlike the fake stuff that basically every other place serves, so impressive.  The Mamoe/lamb flaps are sweet and delicious.  The miso soup is strong and delicious unlike other places that water it down."

1181,Great place to stay.  View is beautiful
1182,I love shopping at pets do I get everything I need at one stop.
1183,"Nancy lake is an amazing place. To have the best experience you must bring you canoe our kayak, and be prepared to port it over land. There are some wood skids along some of the portages that you can slide your boat along to make it easier.

This is a quintessential piece of Alaska that is a small drive from Anchorage."
1184,I like the tacos
1185,Their pizza is nasty made my family sick
1186,Best shopping in town
1187,There's always a long wait and the cell service is terrible so make sure you bring something to do.

1190,"This place is so unorganized. Had to wait 20 minutes for my ""fast"" food. The lack of direction and management is the only reason for it."
1191,Very good food
1192,The food was good! And it was fun to get out of the house.
1193,Best automotive shop in Anchorage! Took my Isuzu in and they fixed all the leaks. I took it to CPR and they overpriced me. Reformed is the way to go! Keep up the great work gentlemen!
1194,Do the survey on the receipt get a code and get free food you got to order a large soda
1195,Got what you need if you are willing to pay the marked up price

1201,Always have what I need. The popcorn machine and the pets make it a fun errand for the kids ....
1202,Good atmosphere
1203,"I used to go here because of the convenience however thier prices have skyrocketed in the last 2 years - so much so you're more likely to pay up to 2x more for a service just from them than the DMV. New ID is $15 from DMV but $45 at this place; I changed a title and it was the $30 State cost and they wanted $32 on top of it so 10 min and it was twice as expensive. Pro Tip: DMV has a live video feed on their website to see how busy it is.

If you don't mind paying 2x then this place is just as good and is quicker but you pay for it however service can be spotty at times; I've had difficult encounters when dealing with items that require a manager and that manager not be on duty."
1204,"Went to Hallmark to grab a Christmas ornament... lucky, got the last one of a hard to find product."
1205,"Great place, walked on an actual dredge."

1218,"(Translated by Google) ehhh

Ehhh"
1219,"Yes. This is the place -- with, frankly, some of the very best wings we've eaten in Alaska (or anywhere else). Especially on a wintry day, a perfectly respectable hot pizza, a good sandwich and fries, and a shared plate of wings ought to warm you right up. We love the lodge-inspired look of the place. Tip: try to snag that seat near -- but not right in front of -- the fireplace!"
1220,"Our fishing charter captain recommended Cape Fix Lodge for the view and Brie & crab dip. We hiked up Married Man's trail. Service was slow with the cruise boat rush, but the food was delicious. We had halibut fish and chips and the Brie and crab dip and I'd go straight back here to eat again in the future."
1221,"An incredible place to stop by, relax, and enjoy the views."
1222,"Very expensive, better prices during the matinee."

1228,I enjoy the knowledge shared by employees an I love the variety an quality products
1229,"Hugh and helpful place, lots of good stuff!"
1230,This place had good food and drinks and the bartender was decent and offered samples occasionally. I would definitely consider this a local gem which this city seems to have quite a lot of. I cannot wait to stop by again.
1231,Staff was awesome here. Very helpful. Nice options on different levels of difficulty for the trail. Nice facilities. Remarkably nice bathrooms. Parking could be better however
1232,Very over priced for what it is.
1233,Get your has and get your coffee.  Bonus points for having a growler filling station here
1234,"We has just arrived in town, this place was a short walk from our hotel and the parking lot was packed.Our waitress' name was Jennifer and she was great. Friendly, prompt and well aware of menu items. Salad bar was awesome(large fresh selection), so was clam chowder and shrimp salad."

1244,"I've been here several times and each time was a great experience. All the bar tenders I've met here, really take the time to get to know you, and talk with you. The drinks aren't over priced, the decor is perfect for Ketchikan, and bar is of good size.

I suggest if you're looking for a relaxing good time, that this is the bar for you."
1245,They carry Eskimo Ice Fishing stuff!
1246,"I'm in love. I've never been in a JoAnn's this big. Think your standard fabric store on steroids. It has so many art forms covered that you can surely find something you need. Whether you are a fabric artist, a crafter, a canvas artist and more. This is the place you want to check out."
1247,"I ate here a few months ago and got soup and meatball sandwich. the soup was amazing, the sandwich was kind of lame. ive been coming back with the hopes of eating that delicious coconut curry soup but everytime since the first they never have soup, of any kind! the sandwiches arent really worth it without that soup"

1260,"Grape tap was gracious enough to allow us to host my bridal shower downstairs in their gorgeous wine cellar. Ian was our server and made sure each and every one of us 30 ladies had champagne and hot food, and anything we needed while we were down there. He was excellent! It was a perfect intimate location for a bougie boozy brunch. Kirstin the owner met with my maid of honor and I before the shower to choose menu items &  tasted champagnes to serve. The entire process was very seamless from start to finish and was also relatively affordable considering all 30 ladies had full bellies and all the champagne and wine they could drink in 3 hours. We had a wonderful time and will be sure to recommend Grape Tap for private events in the future."
1261,Great
1262,Went in the summer. Very fun did the hour long trail ride and had a great time. The hot springs felt great after the ride. Had dinner in the restaurant service was good and the Chena Burger was delicious!
1263,Great food Beautiful place
1264,Great nordic ski trails throughout the park.
1265,It was bloomin great!
1266,Huge and magnificent
1267,Friendly staff and great service üëç
1268,"Friendly staff. Good drinks. Great little dive bar to come visit with friends. No food, tho..."
1269,"Friendly employees, quick service."
1270,My wife loves this place she could eat here every day and multiple times a day.
1271,A great experience. Outstanding food and brew.
1272,"Food is really good .  .  . especially for AK. But you get 3 star because your hours are garbage. Absolutely the most backward hours someone could have for that type of business. What are great days to enjoy a great bbq .  .  . probably a Tuesday or Wednesday around 4pm. NO! SCREW THAT! WHO THE H*LL WANTS BBQ AT THAT TIME .   .  . NOBODY! For months now we keep telling one another ""let's get AJ's"" and guess what for the last 20 weeks we've said that on a Sunday or Monday .   .  . and I bet we're not the only ones. Fix your schedule."
1273,Awesome!
1274,"Almost always has what I need, and prices are pretty good too."
1275,Great place and staff
1276,Is a very nice place. Here it starts the trail to exit glacier I'm Harding icefield. There are plenty parking spots but I would recommend to go early to get a sport. The parking spot is free. There are restrooms but little untidy. Inside you'll find souvenirs and some details about the glacier
1277,"So I have heard nothing but raves about this place. A few up front details, they were at 80% seating, Saturday at 5pm. That being said I will start my review. First and foremost  I haven't a clue to what type of wait side service happens here, do you take my order, do I ask at the counter for my meal, when do I pay? What gives? The most unconventional type of service I think I have ever encountered. Felt somewhat confusing. The wait staff is friendly when and if they make it to your table. This leads me to believe they maybe understaffed.

Now the pizza, I have eaten at every pizza join in the Fairbanks area. I'm really not sure what you call this. Maybe this is a hippy, granola style place... You know, the place people go to eat crappy food only because it's trendy. Myself and everyone that ate our table agree, this is bottom 30% pizza for the Fairbanks area.

The plus side is the view of the flight line of Fairbanks International watching planes land and takeoff. The majority of the window seats facing the active have a few sets of binoculars to use while you are sitting there. Cold beer on tap to boot. I would go here to have a few and watch the planes do their thing (airport lounge style).

In a wheel chair or disabled, better order one to go, stairs are required to access. I am sure they can deliver to the bottom of them.

Two stars for confusing service and pizza I could cook at the house. Don't let wood fire fool you."
1278,Great views on the bay. Entrance of the trail
1279,Only Carnitas my husband will eat.
1280,It.is wonderful to see Alaska native animals in their natural habitat.  I highly recommend it.
1281,Really good pizza. I love the thick crust
1282,"My cat is an out door cat and would see and visit our neighbors so I assumed he was fine. He was captured and taken to the pound. I had him for 10 years and He has never been to the pound. When I finally realized he was not with neighbors I called the pound and they said he was there. I asked if they could hold him for me one extra day cause I just gave birth to my son, still in the hospital, with a one day old son. They said they couldn't. I was heart broken because later that day someone adopted him. What i don't understand is that they had a chance to give my cat back to his original owners. I traveled with my cat. Had him since he was a kitten, He was with me throughout two pregnancies. My husband and I were heart broken. So when my son's birthday comes around we think of our cat the day before because that was the day we lost one of our family members. My cat also saved my son from a pitbull attack I love and miss him dearly."
1283,Great staff
1284,"Wonderfully safe a secure place to store my items!  Manager is a friendly, informative, and very pleasant man!"
1285,Taco Tuesday is the best
1286,Good toasted subs. Online ordering was easy.
1287,Great store... lots of selection.  Very nice store.
1288,High quality deli and wide array of options.
1289,Breakfast
1290,It is just ok because there is no competition for them to compete with... so they keep high rates. .. would very much like to see competition against them..
1291,"Where do we even start leaving a review for this wonderful place. Our pup got terribly sick and it was her time to go. The care and compassion everyone had there was phenomenal. The way they handled our bill and told us the costs upfront was amazing. Then when it was time for her to go the way they handled it was so amazing. It was so comforting and the best experience with a vet we could have hoped for. Then we received the card.. we never expected a card and here we are crying again. Signed by all the staff giving condolences. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for compassionate, respectful, upfront and thorough care."
1292,Best mexican food in the valley
1293,Cochinita pibil is out of this world
1294,Great burgers
1295,This shop is super sweet for the contractor of fyi enthusiasts. Find things not available in the big box stores..
1296,Best Pizza in Alaska in the best town in Alaska
1297,"Everywhere was sticky and gross. It was loud and chaotic Half of the machines were broken. The ticket counter machine was absolutely rediculous, having to individually put all them in there manually was a freaking joke. Then the food took forever to come out and then pizza was probably the worst pizza I have ever eaten not to mention it gave me a terrible stomach ache. Then it took Chuck a half an hour to come out after the video (that was seemily made in 1990) played like 10 times. Chuck E Cheese's glory days have long past."
1298,Steak was cook perfect. The peanut butter pie... wish I could adequately describe it... go even if it is just to get any of their desserts
1299,Friendly people. Relaxed and guided environment
1300,Great meat selection.
1301,I really enjoy this older style establishment thats been in Fairbanks forever..
1302,"Really a unique and beautiful place. Unfortunately, I visited the city while on a cruise so I didn't get to spend as much time looking around as I'd have liked. I hope to go back one day and have an opportunity to explore it more."
1303,"Thank you Bennie, Brandon, Sarah, Alyssa, Janie and Karate for always providing awesome drinks! Great food and a wonderful friendly atmosphere with a sophisticated, dynamic setting‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
1304,Its no seaworld but its the best alaska has and is work a visit.
1305,"Nothing spectacular, but okay if you don't want to commute to anchorage, or the valley."
1306,"Delicious meat lover's pizza. My order was prepared on-time based on their estimate. The service was friendly and outgoing. Menu items are rather pricey ($20 for a medium pizza). But it's a local restaurant, so I shouldn't be surprised."
1307,"Awesome place, food is good, desert is amazing!!"
1308,"Awesome little place for breakfast. It doesn't look like much but the food was delicious and it came out quickly. The servers there were also very friendly. If all you want is a delicious breakfast without all the extra foo-foo, this is the place to go. Also, they only take cash."
1309,Very nice place for both Kodiak residents and out of towners!
1310,"Great service, Rates and Clean Rooms."
1311,"Neat little place with good beer, good food and some live music."
1312,Best place to eat In Delta. Kind of disappointing they are only open in the summer. But the food is great.
1313,"An incredible place to be! The river is super wide and the scenery is magnificent. The only downside is, the mountainscape is not as impressive as other campgrounds."
1314,"This place has been a staple location in our community. Always a great place to take the kids to get their energy out (large playground works well for Nerf wars and has an area designated for toddlers) and a great place for a small stroll on the Riverwalk alongside the ""World Famous"" Kenai River. Soldotna Creek Park has been one of the best investments made to improve our community for all ages"
1315,Affordable goods. Really delicious deli and Chinese food at an affordable price.
1316,Great trails
1317,Probably my favorite burger place in Anchorage.
1318,"The food is GOOD! You get large portions and a huge DELITIOUS dessert. The service is 5 star but they need to expand the weekend hours. People come from far and wide to get some of that yum yum goodness they have to offer. Be smart people eat some now and save some for later, this way you have room for dessert. We all got different ones and shared LOL"
1319,Yup.
1320,Average grocery store.
1321,Fast and delicious desserts
1322,Ayla and her staff are great.  They are all pretty smart cookies and I can tell they have great knowledge of the Anchorage investment property opportunities. I trust they will make a great decision for me when I finally decide on a property I want
1323,A place to stay if you're just looking for a place to crash for the night then go about your day. Mediocre service at a decent price for the location.
1324,"There is absolutely nothing remarkable about this hotel, good or bad, except that it is in Anchorage. I got a great deal on Priceline and had a perfectly acceptable stay. The front desk people were pleasant. The room was tiny (my suitcase didn't fit between the TV stand and the bed) but clean and comfortable. I appreciated the mini fridge in the room and the laundry facilities in the basement. It's taller than the surrounding buildings, which makes it easy to see the amazing scenery, once you've made it up to your room in the world's slowest elevator. Not my favorite hotel, but I'll probably stay here, again."
1325,Friendly staff and free coffee
1326,Good
1327,Had and wonderful time at an amazing show. My girlfriend and I loved watching Celtic Woman. They were spectacular.
1328,WHO DOESNT LOVE SANTA!!!
1329,"Run by Holland America so very well run, clean and organized.  Food in site decent but expensive.  Small nature trails along Nenana river.   Wildlife tour at night very short but informative"
1330,It's an older theater that seems worn down but the movies are only $4 and it's close to home.
1331,Well executed dinner menu and attentive service
1332,The pizza was hard and was just horrible for what i paid
1333,Good food   . 4 stars since the eggroll was advertised as having pork in it but it didn't ..
1334,"Delicious, but spring for the upgraded rice."
1335,Very curtious workers good product
1336,clean and safe
1337,Good customer service.
1338,Awesome
1339,Great atmosphere a great place to meet new people DJ there Friday and Saturday and of course mama pouting the best drinks in the area. Its like ur home at the moose creek lodge bar where u come a stranger and leave a part of the family!
1340,"By far my favorite place to eat in eagle River. It's a relaxed atmosphere and the good is very good,"
1341,I love the food here. I've eaten almost everything on the menu and had nary a bad experience. They are a mainstay for me.

1348,A very Alaskan restaurant with a full bar and home-cooked food.
1349,Food was so delicious !!
1350,"I love the Kenai killer burger, fabulous."
1351,The remodel has made Fairbank's best kept secret for this location. They have the best gas station coffee and the venue looks fantastic. I just went in for coffee today and the lady in the back of the counter let me have it for free. Such a charming gesture. I'll certainly come here.
1352,Definitely not anchorage's pride. Location is fine but the variety of stores kinda lame. . and what is it gonna be now that Sears is closing?
1353,"Great healthy products, one of the best fred's in all of the land!"
1354,Would recommend this place for sure
1355,"Great food well worth a stop, i get to the airport extra early and enjoy a plate of loaded potato wedges and a beer before every flight"
1356,The playground was amazing and the views were stellar.
1357,Nice comfy place to drink coffee
1358,"Is kept fairly clean and well maintained. Store variety is good but layout is bothersome. Nice to have Ulta, Old Navy, and Perfumania. For a while, there were too many of those scammy kiosk salespeople but that's gotten better. I try not to visit after dark (in winter) or on weekends because of the car breakins and the shady crowds."
1359,Great park big open field.
1360,Its ok there is limited items in the store and always treat you with respect
1361,They usually get your order wrong and the food is lukewarm.
1362,The one and only time ive been here. For my graduation dinner. Good place.
1363,"This is by far the BEST dispensary I've gone to. Always a sale or discount of some kind. I'm a huge fan of the points system. They have double points on certain days.
I'm now only shopping here. FYI the coolest service people around. Friendly and relaxed atmosphere. It's a got to experience kinda place."
1364,I drive a big truck and I love the service
1365,Great staff and community resources
1366,Its fast food.

1369,"Excellent service and food. Nice selection of local beers.
I had the Babe's Roll with Rib eye as my choice of meat. Delicious."
1370,Always a great place to eat.  Deb runs an awesome place.  Killer Kenai Burger is off the hook.
1371,City REALLY needs to grade road. It was horrible.
1372,"It's a neat little place, you can see Santa even in June and take a picture with him. Gift shop was huge and we got to see the reindeers.."
1373,"Never a dull moment or bad food - we drag the family out for fish and chips here a couple times a month. It's the best in town, the service is always top notch, and the atmosphere is fun and full of locals"
1374,Fast and easy.
1375,Staff is always so helpful!!!
1376,"I met a friend here for lunch. We both ordered burgers during a fairly busy afternoon, just past lunch hour.

While our food was basic lunch fare, both burgers were prepared as ordered, served hot and fresh, and were delicious.

Service was excellent, ambiance was upscale bar, and our experience enjoyable."
1377,I use this place as a stop when driving to Cantwell. Everyone there is so sweet and nice.
1378,This was amazing. You have to come here to get the cheek halibut. Then complete the meal with the baked Alaska. Service is amazing. The view is amazing. And the food even better. A real good place to have a nice dinner.
1379,The food was excellent.
1380,"Good menu options. The staff is mostly high school kids so double check your order, I usually have at least one thing wrong. But it's still good food."
1381,"A classic style hotel. Old but well maintained, small bar/restaurant at the lobby free airport / hotel shuttle. Hotel have a breakfast, also the staff is friendly but some times it seem like they are so stressed that customer service disappear. Maybe management can improve this. Since there is always room for improvement. Remember this is a 3 star hotel."
1382,Great place to skate. It's a good facility and the  prices are affordable.
1383,A very good place to learn
1384,You'll pay a lot to fly in are state as much as a trip to Seattle or even Vegas on a sale or Hawaii during pfd season but it is what it is and they will get you to the remote places you need to go with your gear in tow
1385,Very secure storage  !!!!!
1386,"Terrible nasty under cooked fries, cheese not melted, overall just poor prep and service"
1387,Oh man such a fun place. They have great sales often. Though there selection of body jewelry isn't the best. I can never find my size. Some freative and fun stuff in thr store. I was looking for gifts for 2 of my friends and I found them. So that was good. Friendly service and amazing staff. Stop by ... it will be worth it.
1388,Great shoes great price!!
1389,$5.00 pizza!! Hot and delicious and quick
1390,Always correct fast and fresh order
1391,Every one loves this place. Great for a meetup or to grab some coffee.
1392,Providing the ablity to create smile's. Thank u
1393,"It's a great place to have company picnics, family get-togethers, or just walking along the beach. It has shelters, fire pits, picnic tables, and stairs to get to the beach. The view is quite breathtaking. Definitely wonderful place to go rain or shine."
1394,"Good water pressure, the wand werked great, the credit machine stopped charging when I turned it off.. Just wish I coulda used CC to buy drying implements..."
1395,Great staff!
1396,"Server was suuuuper stoned and forgot most of our food, it was still good when we finally got it"
1397,It's alright
1398,Because they ripped me off with a card
1399,This place has the best burger in the state. This smile says it all. Love these burgers
1400,"Best restaraunt in Valdez. The view by the window is amazing and there is a wide selection of food. The Hawaiian Pizza was great, as was the halibut. Food is a bit pricey though, and my burger was well done even though I asked for medium rare (patties are frozen so they can't do anything other than well done)."
1401,"Wasn't impressed by anything, won't go back. The staff was rude, had their underage children working as well. It was a nightmare."
1402,Ended up going to best buy. The manager had a great deal of energy... But the other employees seemed groggy. Seemed geared towards easy sales.
1403,"My waitress was Sam and she was a blast to have, funny, and very energetic."
1404,"Food is good.  Cleanliness and customer service could improve my a lot. The host/waitress was rude and couldn't explain the menu.  Also was rude to my wife. Also there's was a guy sleeping on the other side of restaurant and someone started to smoke a cigarette. Yuuk! Anyways, but good was good and fast.  But other can be better."
1405,Great people awsome food
1406,very professional environment and quick service. did not wait for hours. I like
1407,Love strains they have and customer service is knowledgable and friendly
1408,Prices are higher than the taxes anywhere else. And didn't get full on the servings per person.
1409,Just looking at it.
1410,Good food and friendly staff!
1411,"Great food but needs updated atmosphere, news furniture"
1412,"Snail slow service, horribly lacking on staff, staff even complaining about working conditions. The good food isn't worth the service."
1413,"Barbie and her cafe are amazing! Right now she's working by herself, and still getting everything out in a timely manner. Such a sweet gal and the food is good too!"
1414,"Of all the things to come to Fairbanks, one thing we were lacking is a solid burger place. This fills that spot and does so excellently. There is a wait, but that's due to its current popularity. The quality is much worth the wait though."
1415,A brief view of the pipeline.   Definitely a picture opportunity.
1416,I love the Non-Dairy options. The Non-Dairy Maui
1417,With the reopening of restaurants in Anchorage business is slow. I had a great time. Please visit they are doing it right and want their customers back!
1418,Really good sandwiches and shakes
1419,Fast & easy lunch for me! Yum!
1420,Great place to buy
1421,Food was absolutely delicious

1424,GREAT service....always willing to accommodate delivery times to make things work for you!!....The flowers are always fresh and very long lasting.
1425,Cool atmosphere and descent bar food.
1426,best breakfast burritos

1428,Always amazing service! I won't take my car anywhere else!
1429,It is a Safeway satellite liquor store / smoke shop.
1430,Excellent place for breakfast if you are in Anchorage anytime. Service was amazing. Everything we had was so good. Would definitely recommend anyone and would ourselves love to visit again.
1431,I had one of the Benton boxes and it was very good..My husband had the mixed plate and it was delicious and plentiful...Nice decor and fast friendly service...Will return!
1432,Food and service is excellent. Hit it up!
1433,"There is always something wrong or missing from our order. Tonight a full burger missing and the fries and tater tots were disgusting. You can't talk to anyone, just leave a message and hope they call you back. Ordered ahead on the app, still waited over 30 minutes for horrible food and food we never got."
1434,"Brakes  still squeekafter spending 500.00 wouldn't even look at them.
Their employees think it's okay to cuss you out, when you point out they are wrong."
1435,Excellent. Service!!!
1436,No complains when I stayed here.  Will sleep here again
1437,Love it
1438,A quick and hearty hike easily accessible from Anchorage. It can be fun when there are blueberries on the lower mountain. We've hiked it throughout the year and it's always pretty.
1439,Service is always excellent at the Midtown location.
1440,"Now I must say I was skeptical about the fun a bingo hall could provide because I have never been to one before. Once you get in there you see how excited people are to spend time with those they care about, popping pull tabs, and playing bingo; it is infectious for sure. Before you know it, your playing multiple cards like a pro. This place has a good feel with very polite staff members and helpful patrons, I will definately be going back here again soon."
1441,"It was ok, but couldn't find what I was looking for"
1442,"Great food and views! If I lived in Palmer, I'd probably be a regular. This was a fantastic stop on our road trip through Alaska!"
1443,They got some dope pepperoni
1444,"Good place to buy beads, they had gotten bone beads too now 9nce i asked them after another bead store closed"
1445,"Excellent food and service, they are usually busy though!"
1446,"I Staff is always so helpful, and it is a rare occasion that can't find what I need here. Love shopping at Quilt Tree!"
1447,"Family friendly, good service, and great atmosphere."
1448,Great food and big portions
1449,"Food was good, staff nice, clean and quite.  Would good back."
1450,They seem to always have what I need.
1451,"Was very impressed with my sushi! The portion  sizes of sushi were way larger then expected. I ordered two rolls and ended up getting my first Togo box ever for sushi! It was too good to leave behind. We almost ran out of table space!

HEADS UP- one roll can definitely fill you up. Keep in mind if you get a roll, you also get miso soup and salad!

Was very happy with the taste of my food and the cost!"
1452,Always friendly and great service. We've enjoyed everything we have ordered here
1453,"The place was very clean, but the food selection was very , very limited."
1454,Fresh food and prompt service
1455,friendly staff!! great weed!!  good prices!!!
1456,"They give you a punch card, once its filled, you get a free coffee.  Plus I like the friendly girls that work there."
1457,"Clean, nice staff, smallish seats, senior and military discount"
1458,"Friendly place, go on in have a beer and a shot, Check out the zig zag pool table. I'll be back."
1459,Great low price carwash right in center of town. I dont recommend the autowash for a deep clean as good as this lol :p!
1460,Great area; close to Fred Meyers.
1461,"Chair 5 has an awesome variety of food. Highly suggest Dano's Crowbar burger (triple patty) and the deep dish pizza. Also, for those 21+, try the La Fin De Monde. A little pricey but it is a larger imported bottle of a citrus crisp brew that ends with a creamy kick."
1462,I am very happy with the Vet that neutered my dog. Her and her team took good care of him.
1463,They are very helpful. Will take time to give you advice. And have the right tools to attack the problem.
1464,Fast service
1465,"Good food, even better prices
kuq e zi!!"
1466,Takes great care of our elderly citizenry.
1467,Ice Dogs hockey is the best show in town!
1468,I typically come here on most Fridays. The ATM was down so I couldn't check my balance. I came and got the Express meal from the made to order area. They also have a great breakfast burrito too. Anyway point is their food is pretty good for the price.
1469,"This place is my go-to vape shop.  They have all the flavors and can mix a huge menu of just about anything you can imagine.  The place itself is chill, they have couches, games, drinks, and snacks.  The parking is easily accessible (with wheelchair access), and the owners go way above and beyond for customer service.  They can build coils and work your mechs too, if that's your thing. It's probably the one vape shop I didn't want to immediately leave after my purchase."
1470,"Beautiful romantic walk, took a lot of winter pics. One of my favorite places to go."
1471,Top secret Carr's
1472,"ERNC has a sizable paved parking lot. Parking is $5 or I believe there annual pass is $50. Inside are a few exhibits that include furs and footprints of local animals. They host several classes in the course of the week targeted towards youngsters and experts alike (separate classes of course! ). A small gift shop inside has some snacks and merchandise. The trails are well marked and beautifully wide. A large trail system stretches through Crow Pass out by Girdwood. Please be aware of wildlife. This area is known for bears, moose and others."
1473,"Sorry for the 1 star was driving hit a bump in the road , I couldn't get anyone to wait on me , waited 20min not one person asked me if I've been helped so I left , maybe we might try it again"
1474,"As the hotel is getting older it is starting to show its ware and tare, kind of to be expected in prudhoe bay.  The staff is very polite and courteous.  I bought a number of coffees for the crew and girl running the shop was very talkative and interesting.  Will go back."
1475,This park is wonderful spot to take the kids!
1476,Even had vegan pizza!
1477,"Excellent and knowledgeable guides - Lacy, Scott and Warren. We were a group of 10 on the advanced trek option. They made us feel safe and were always encouraging. Explained different formations on the glaciers. Overall, 10 out of 10. All required equipment was provided - Backpack, jacket, gloves, crampon, boots, harness. Definitely recommend to anyone who want to have a good fun day"
1478,"No bags or drink carriers.... ""Sorry""
Sorry doesn't work"
1479,Wide range of options.. clean and friendly..
1480,Always nicr
1481,Wonderful people and a wealth of knowledge.
1482,Nice place to get a good view of Denali on a clear day.
1483,"Megan has been taking care of my locks for the past 6 years ever since moving to Alaska from Miami, FL. I was so nervous at first to find a new hair stylist after coming from a big city but ended up hitting the jackpot with Megan! I LOVE going to her and couldn't imagine anyone else doing my hair. She is so talented and just an absolute sweetheart, I trust her so much I just let her take the reins and she always does a wonderful job. She was even kind enough to come to Palmer for my wedding day to do my hair as well as updos for my bridesmaids. We all looked stunning. If you're looking for a new stylist, id say look no further, Megan is the best!"
1484,"Food is fine, but it seems like no matter what time it is, you'll be waiting 15+ minutes for your food. Service is consistently slow here and not fast in any way whatsoever."
1485,"Cute place with sweet dogs. Affordable quick sled/wheels ride. Free film about the dogs, gift shop & small museum, pleasant staff. Real deal. Not real ""touristy""."
1486,"Not to bad, have had much worse and much better, could be cheaper but still not to bad, kinda a let down on menu selection and Sake wasnt the best ether but overall worth the visit"
1487,Best Home Depot in Anchorage
1488,"Excellent staff, service, kind polite, and personable. I'll never buy a tire anywhere else again."
1489,"Got there upon opening, short wait. Staff at front desk were rude and unhelpful, but caseworkers were friendly and were able to give me answers to all my questions!"
1490,I went in to buy a drawing tablet and we asked someone to help us. He sent us to someone else who then led us to the tablets. The drawing tablets are like a big mouse pad but cost $120. We asked if he had anything cheaper. He told us he went to look and said he would be right back. 30 min later me and my mom are still waiting there. then some other guy comes up and asks if we need help. we ended up listening to how he dose puzzles for like 20min. we finely got away and the we saw the guy that was helping us earlier was just selling phones to someone else. LAME!!!
1491,Looks lots of fun for kids!!!
1492,Always good food an amazing fast service I especially enjoyed the chips and salsa.
1493,This is the only park in town that I know of with the long rail slides (hard to describe) young and old kids alike seem to enjoy them a lot. The park has been remodeled recently and has not been vandalized (yet). Generally nice people around as well.
1494,"Located next door to the Williwa Social Club, this brewery offers a wide selection of local micro-brews and entertainment."
1495,It's great that you need to be wearing a mask in the plaza!
1496,What could have been a trying experience was resolved in a very short time. I appreciated the concern shown by the staff and the resolution of my problem... quickly and efficiently.
1497,Took 10mins to get menus another 5 for iced tea. 3 waitresses standing behind the bar talking. After another 15mins without anyone coming to take our order we went to the hostest station and paid. We are a mixed race couple and feel this could've been a factor.
1498,Wow!
1499,Great grilled halibut.
1500,Nice workout from bottom to top and then back down.  Has amazing view all around!
1501,"Quality of the foods was not good, attendants were rude and had a bad manner to answer to you and I did not like tbe decor( it was like a coffehouse from 80's and at the end, the prices compare to quality and quantity was so high
I ordered Alaskan cod fish and chips.
Fiah was frozen and very moist and no taste at all and instead of chips, I had potato wedges!!
Every time I wanted a refill or order a new food, I had to wait min 10 min for server to come to my table.
My wife ordered soup (it was curry instead of soup), it was so hot and spicy. And they charged us 4 dollars for a small cup of white rice."
1502,just the place alone is worth 5 stars
1503,"Was pleased with the service, with my purchase and the help we received. Great store to shop and the online site is pretty accurate to the numbers of each item available in our store."
1504,"Have to give them a $100 cash deposit, actual cash unless you use a credit card. Rooms are about 97 degrees when you get there. You must turn on a air conditioner, put a fan in the window and in about 40 min to an hour it's cooled off. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I'm upset I paid a $100 for the room, if it wasn't so late and I wasn't so tired I would have gone somewhere else   Oh, and NOTE, NO REFUNDS. On a positive note, the bar tender who is also your desk clerk, let us know that if you lock yourself out after the bar closes at 10pm there is no way to get back in the building and no one to call to let you back in.  she was however,  very sweet and had great customer service"
1505,cross the creek away from the wood line
1506,Great customer service I only give it four stars because it‚Äôs a small place not to many choices or options.
1507,Just love the produce.
1508,"It's a beautiful park with amazing views!  If you are lucky you may even see whales, otters and sea lions."
1509,Have been doing janitorial services for the borough over 6yrs
1510,"I dont know if this chick really liked my husband, but she gave us $35 off a pair of shoes, so it made our day."
1511,Would be a top priority if I was a tourist and really good tea
1512,"Fun atmosphere and good food if you are looking for the out of the ordinary fare like elk, moose and other northern treats.
The service was good and the food delicious."
1513,Actually nice people in here that served with a smile
1514,Yummy üòÅ
1515,Shout out to the famous yellow smiley face
1516,Beautiful
1517,Like the 8 dollar - 2 whopper deal - not a fan of their fries - YUCK
1518,Many interesting fish. Seals and sea lions we're impressive. Staff was friendly and taught us about octopodes
1519,Good food
1520,"Haven't been in a while, customer service is not as good as it used to be."
1521,"Awesome place! Cool toys and amazing selection of board games. 40k is here too, if that's what you are into."
1522,"Awesome service, my daily place to go, fast service and awesome food, sushi, breakfast all day"
1523,i beleive that someone sneezed on my pizza that i got on 12/11/15 awful. I caught a cold after eating it.  The managers are more than accommodating
1524,Awesome food. Great beers on tap. Sports on the TVs. What more can you ask for? How about the best bloody mary in town! They have it and it's served with a mini Grilled cheese sandwich!!! YUM!
1525,These people really care about our earth and its creatures!
1526,I think for an education and rehabilitation center it's pretty nice.  The entrance fee is a little pricey but worth it to save the Marine wildlife.  If you are in Seward go visit.  It's worth the trip.
1527,Enjoyed their tacos al pastor and the fish tacos.  The tacos as as close to authentic tacos in Mexico as we've had in Alaska.  Love the horchata rice drink as well!
1528,Standard super 8. Good front desk. The breakfast pickings are pretty slim.
1529,i found an olive in my sandwiches and i didnt ask for them but i love olives so thank you :)
1530,I like the chicken not the prices.
1531,It's a nice place to stay
1532,AmAZING
1533,First class food with a relaxed atmosphere.
1534,"Great service, great informative, kind employees, fast service, sturdy installation. Super nice folks and competitive pricing. Will be back !"
1535,It was okay
1536,"Very tough trail, but worth it! The views are astounding!"
1537,Great outdoor fun!
1538,"Ben the security guy is pretty great, cute bartenders. Great prices"
1539,"Fast service, good portions for the price."
1540,The DMV's there you got a couple hair places and of the best Chiropractic in the state of Alaska
1541,"Good crowd, good drinks, and decent prices.  They do trivia during the winters that's loads of fun."
1542,fascinating and informative
1543,We had poor service. Always hate to say it. Did not appear to be the servers fault. Would be hesitant to try again.
1544,"Fast and Friendly
Great Prices"
1545,Nice staff doing what they can to help people
1546,Oooooooooweeeee they got the best food in da world!! I love their buttery corn and potatoes!! Especially the shrimp and steak. Definetly recommend if you‚Äôre craving for steak and what not.
1547,Yes
1548,I haven't eaten there in years but went there for a business lunch.  The service was good but the food wasn't.  I had the whiskey burger.  The meat paddy was cooked right and it was juicy.  But something was way off about the taste.  It was like the sauce had gone bad.  I always thought Applebees had good food but this changed my mind.  It was the worst burger I can remember having. On top of that it didn't set well with my stomach.  To be fair.  Other order different salads and enjoyed them.
1549,"Even if you just stop and browse, well worth stopping in."
1550,My family & I always have fun & find what were looking for when we come here for turtle supplies/food. Always friendly & helpful customer service. Thank you!
1551,I've always got great food n services üòä
1552,Cool things about Valdez and Alaska
1553,"Super friendly,  quick service, excellent food!!"
1554,Great food....
1555,"(Translated by Google) I like the store is super comfortable

(Original)
Me agrado la tienda es super comoda"
1556,Love it!
1557,"First time at BurgerFi. The burger was excellent, the staff friendly, aside from some noise from the fitness center upstairs, the atmosphere was nice. The only detracted were the onion rings - they were considerably different from what I was used to, a bit too much onion and I felt they could have used a tad more seasoning in the batter."
1558,Good supply of products. Good staff.
1559,"(Translated by Google) Tasty dishes!

(Original)
Sabrosos platillos!"
1560,"Modern feel to it, reminds me of a place you'd find in Seattle. Great contemporary art and design. Absolutely excellent food! No waiting for a table or food. Definitely going back!"
1561,This place doesn't grant the online menu and the quality of the food they put out is not very satisfactory as it should be especially comming from a corporation
1562,Great staff
1563,The staff is very friendly and very helpful. I will be going back and telling friends.
1564,"A historic place , quaint n good place for yr week end family time"
1565,Good bar. Good service. Nice rooms.
1566,Always delicious food!
1567,"Very friendly staff. Our order was done quickly, and it tasted great!"
1568,NICE
1569,Been coming here for 6 years. Has to be a reason why.
1570,"Some of the best Mexican in Fairbanks. The food is really solid. Big portions, lots of cheese, meat, and salt. It's essentially everything you're looking from a Mexican restaurant.

Don't come here expecting LA street tacos. Come here expecting enormous portions of whatever you order with enough leftovers for at least one additional meal!"
1571,"Other than Guitar Center and BurgerFi, this mall doesn't have much going for it."
1572,"Seldovia Bay Ferry
I booked my round trip tickets online using my phone to save time.
Seldovia is a charming artistic town.
Vhuntermassage LLC"
1573,"Delicious, quick and relatively cheap. Great lunch spot"
1574,This place is really fun and good for kids
1575,I found the exhibits and historical information  very informative. The museum was absolutely spotless. Some pretty cool equipment. Kids will love it.
1576,"Good for sports, 90% of menu is gross and overpriced."
1577,Applied for a position .. mgr came out and didnt even ask for my name or what I was applying for. Could have been better first thing in the morning. =/
1578,Yummy
1579,A new favorite stop. Friendly staff and its really fun to make up different milkshake flavors. Cinnamon and pear is my next one!
1580,La Mex best Mexican food in town great deals food is great awesome drinks great atmosphere
1581,Great p rice and selection
1582,"Nicest furniture in town, friendly staff and awesome place to work!"
1583,"Very good, portions are huge and love the options. Service is slow especially during lunch hours. Be prepared to hunt down your server. The evening has much better service."
1584,Love turf time
1585,"I had my car detailed by these guys. I've been detailing vehicles of all sizes for around 10 years.

Exterior-

Body had a significant amount of wax that was not fully removed.

Rims still had wax to be removed.

Under the hoodWas still dirty needed a better wipe down before dressing was applied.

Interior-
Skipped the headliner paid extra for that.

Both trays for change and misc items were still dusty with small grains of dirt.

The windows all around looked like they had been wiped with wax microfibers, they're more streaky then when we had it picked up before the detail.

Picked up 40 MINS LATE.

Let's talk business here for a second..If a customer pays you a car payment to detail their vehicle. You should be treating as if it's your vehicle. You know how nice your want it to be if it belonged to you.
If you're given from 9:00am to almost 4:00pm
To complete the vehicle, there's no excuses for.. Dirty windows..Dirty consoles..45percent of wax not wiped off..dirt on the hood..

Now I'll say something nice. Thank you for being able to pick up the car. THEY ALWAYS LOOK BETTER AFTER THEN BEFORE THE DETAIL. I could argue with the owner on this post but I've already seen the responses to the negative reviews..It's more of a battle of experience as opposed to a helping hand or a correction toward corner cutting mistakes."
1586,Great place to shop
1587,Comfortable chairs design is a little different for food
1588,Good sandwich & soup.  BAD waitresses.  My waitress sat down at the end of our counter and the other one braided her hair!!! No hands washed after that little beauty salon trick.  Last time there for me.
1589,Good value & good tasting pizza
1590,Sad part is ....the only sit down 24 hr. Diner in valley
1591,Great pharmacy.
1592,Has some of everything.
1593,"It looks like a dump,  but the food is great and plentiful,  and the price is right.   Been going there for about 30 years."
1594,Nice
1595,"It is extremely difficult communicating with the staff here. It used to be our family‚Äôs happy place but since COVID, time and again has proven the staff members to be unwilling to assist with even the most basic requests. For instance, showing up to pick up some books we put on hold and finding one of them to be the wrong book and having a staff member tell us they need 24 hours to walk upstairs and grab the correct book."
1596,Good food. Quick in and out with to go option.
1597,Best 24/7 towing company in Alaska. Price was affordable and we didn't wait very long. The driver was able to give us a ride to where we needed to go.
1598,"Beautiful during the summer and winter, although I wish the trails weren't restricted to hiking in the winter"
1599,Great Staff and Excellent Care from the doctor.
1600,"Great, juicy burgers. Their fries are fresh. You can have them urban style, which means they will cover your fries in cheese & include a dipping sauce. It can get a little messy to eat them like that. I prefer to eat them plain, but ask for truffle aioli to dip the fries in. It is delicious!

On a separate trip, I tried the CEO burger, with had a wagu beef patty.  It was really good. I think next time, I'd prefer to have it without the carmelized onions.

Overall a great place to eat. Good tasting, quality food. And their ice cream cones are great too!"
1601,Meh
1602,I like to give stuff for the store and give it to my pets
1603,"This is a crowded tourist place, to say the least."
1604,The staff was friendly and very helpful. The food was wonderfully presented and delicious.
1605,"Always busy, but drive thru is fast"
1606,Get the double. Worth the price for Anchorage.
1607,The best Thai restaurant in Fairbanks. Small dining area. Short wait to be seated.
1608,"One of my favorite parks for everything and everyone!  Trails, baseball fields, open fields, a nice pavilion."
1609,Exceeded my expectations. Make sure yo make a reservation if you go. I did not mind sitting at the bar for their food. Best food I've had in Alaska so far.
1610,Delicious food. Staff and owners are very customer first and friendly.
1611,The food is fresh and great. The corn fritters are amazing. The dressings are handmade. They also have great sevice from all of the staff. Everything we got tasted fresh and made there.
1612,"Sold us a tiny piece of MOLDY tiramisou, baklava was horrible, food portions were all small, and too heavily spiced.
The tzatziki sauce was so full of cucumbers pieces the size of icebergs we couldn't enjoy it.
Won't be returning."
1613,Delicious and great service!
1614,The best place to get all your home building needs in Delta Junction and the surrounding area!
1615,Win free movie passes. Get to watch movies. For free
1616,Amazing place with authentic Japanese cuisine. They have amazing service and great sake
1617,Nice mall to just lose yourself in.
1618,I love this place. The tacos are simply amazing
1619,"Great mexican inspired food , lovely place with deck"
1620,The attention to detail is outstanding.... Their work is amazing so they are busy; it helps to book an appointment.
1621,Nothing to share just getting taters
1622,Expensive but the only movie theater in town
1623,The shaved snow was amazing!! Loved all the different flavors and the girl working the front was very friendly andpatient. 10/10 would visit again.
1624,"If there's a better a better deli sandwich place in Alaska, I need to know immediately!"
1625,Yummy!
1626,Very beautiful riverside with beaver dam just upstream from the tent camping spots.
1627,Best fly shop in Alaska!  Definitely stop by if you need anything fly fishing related
1628,Best chili burger I've ever had!!!
1629,"The signature savory smoked salmon crepe is BOM!! My pic can't capture just how delicious and savory. The crepe pastry was light, perfectly toasted, just right flavor to compliment the smoked salmon, cream cheese and capers... wow! Lots of salmon, perfect smoke on it, and folded just right to hold while walking. A true crepe! Friendly, fast chefs, too. Plus you can look out at the famous Whale Park just steps away across the street!"
1630,Excellent job
1631,Great coffee and friendly staff.
1632,Chicken was over cooked
1633,"So this is an interesting place to get pizza, right on the eastern edge of Denali national park (for those of you that still think or say ""Mckinley"", you're way behind the times).  Anyeay, the locale is cool, right next to a vicious creek.  Theres a horseshoe pit and cornhole lane in the front.  Plenty of space outside for you to get ravaged by mosquitos, so bring bug spray.  The views of the m li mountains are awesome.  Inside it's a quaint place, where strange but friendly locals hang out.  The pizza itself, for anyone from places where real pizza is made like the upper east coast, is a bit disappointing.  The sauce is really sweet for starters.  The crust is ok for a pie made outside of the tri-state area, and the toppings seem fresh.  But the flavor is just not what I'm used to eating.  Its wasn't bad, but it's nothing that I'd rave about.  I visited during the whole COVID pandemic, and social distancing or mask-wearing was not an issue nor was it enforced or respected.  All in all, I would not go out of my way to eat her again, I may never eat her again period, but at least I can say I tried it.  I'm not  saying dont go, go and give them s try, judge their pizza for yourself."
1634,Great breakfast and super great service. Had breakfast this morning around 10:30 and those girls were on top of their game running the whole time from table to table making sure everyone had refills. Ate here twice while I was in town.
1635,Took the evening onboard dinner cruise.  The food was very good and the scenery was spectacular.
1636,Went there for a birthday brunch the food was fabulous
1637,"Only drive-through(at July 2019).
bad-quality burger"
1638,"Great service, fair prices, overall great experience, thank you."
1639,"Service is great.  Bread really good.
The only reason I can't give 4 or even 5 stars is their environmental impact.

I am just disappointed that they have no alternative to the single use plastic bags. While they strive to accommodate my wish to not have been the bread pre packed, I wish the company would avoid it in the 1st place.
I love our natural beauty and try my best to deny any single use plastic and hope I can make a difference."
1640,"During football season we head there and enjoy a nice cold beer with their breakfast pizza. Good food, good service."
1641,"I have always had good food no issues and great service.  I am a carne asada, fajita or simple Taco lady. My family has had all different items and they eat it up no complaints."
1642,"Update: Brought from 4 stars to 3. The hashbrowns are always inconsistent! Sometimes they are great and other times terrible.

Pancakes were delicious of course! Tea wasn't great but ok. Water in the bathrooms needed to get warmer. However, the whole experience wasn't bad. Only place to get breakfast at 7pm on the South Side."
1643,"Waited 30 minutes to pay my cellphone service, to only be disrespected by employee! Cricket service suxz, will be going back to Straight Talk as soon as I get rid of Cricket plan."
1644,Awesome had Baby back ribs and they were Fabulous.  For my Birthday dessert I got the crossiant bread pudding üò≤
1645,I liked the atmosphere of the place and wait staff was friendly.
1646,"It has a great selection, and larger than I thought. The staff are knowledgeable about the products they sell"
1647,Every type of Alaskan souvenir you could ever wish for - or not as the case may be
1648,Great service.
1649,"Pretty good food, ok service"
1650,Good food
1651,Good food very nice establishment.  But pricey food for being a military eating facility.
1652,Here at AT&T  getting my account fixed up!üòâ
1653,Very nice small cozy place with a wide variety of dishes. Very nice staff I recommend Royal üáπüá≠ Thai.
1654,Slow as ever. Only one cashier and the department store was very busy.
1655,"Our meal was mostly tasty, if expensive.  We started with cocktails:  2 of our party enjoying specialties, and my Alaska Grown, with gin, ginger liqueur, cucumber syrup, and lime was fantastic.  Apps were appreciated--my favorite of the 2 was lettuce wraps with seasoned and minced chicken, cilantro, red onion, daikon shreds, and Serrano chiles all wrapped in Bib Lettuces.  Delicious!  The rest if the oarty liked the Ahi Poke Nachos better than I did.  My entree was a huge piece of halibut, pesto-crusted, over fingerling potatoes and asparagus with a red pepper coulis.  It was just okay--the fish hadn't much flavor, though the coulis was very nice.  Another of us had Black Cod with Baby Bok Choy and it was very tasty.  I didn't try my friends' Scallop dish or the King Crab mac 'n cheese,  but they both loved it.  It was around this time I noticed every other table was receiving  complimentary focaccia and salmon spread, which our table of 4 was denied.  I am still miffed and disappointed at thus oversight.  But our waiter was interesting, and not in a good way.  He gave us little time before asking for our orders and kept interrupting conversation, almost as if he had little to do.  Not being offered bread by him was just the most egregious fault.  Nobody wanted dessert but me, so I went light with Coconut Mango Panna Cotta.  10 minutes after ordering it, a lady alerted us that it is new and they are finessing the plating, would not be charging us for it, and wanted our feedback.  It was another 10 minutes before it arrived and was almost terrible.  Panna Cotta should be silky and smooth.  This was dense, grainy, and rubbery with a very mild flavor of coconut milk.  It would have been helped by more sauce, but the tiny, artsy-fartsy dribbles of mango and raspberry sauces weren't enough to help or hide the dessert.  I won't order that again.  Mostly a great meal with beautiful views of Mt. Healy, but some misses will keep me from returning very soon.  I'd rather explore and support other places in the area first."
1656,"Amazing and Quick Hike. The View is Amaxing and you will have a hard time finding a better place to take kids, your doggo, or a date. There are no bears or moose that I've ever seen. It seems to be well taken care of and the people obviously appreciate the area because it is always clean. Highly recommend üòÅüëçüëçüíö‚ù§üíô"
1657,"Had the California chicken sandwich. Fresh guac, juicy chicken breast, and a nice beer on the side. Lost one star bc the fries just don‚Äôt get consistent seasoning. I‚Äôve been here a few times now - and it‚Äôs like they season the fries unevenly and you get some bland bites right next to bites with way too much seasoning. Great staff and fun atmosphere."
1658,"Great, entertaining, learning experience"
1659,"Just for today, I will enjoy life..."
1660,"Rat problems, slow, rotting tomatoes... You name it"
1661,Staff is good here and food. Place is pretty clean. The bathrooms smell like a swimming pool sometime from all the chlorine they use. Got double charged once.
1662,Love thats it open 24/7! Good shakes
1663,"Great tasting Pizza. it's a small joint run by single man, so do give him sometime if you are a big party.. We loved the pizza they were amazing, especially cheese"
1664,"I can usually find what I'm looking for. The regular employees are pretty great, cant say as much for the seasonal hires."
1665,Nasty!!! Never Again.
1666,This place always has a line of cars out to the street. Not because they‚Äôre super popular but because it takes them 5 minutes for each car at the window. Easily the worst run restaurant in town.
1667,"Good food, especially for a bar!"
1668,Great hotel restaurant was good
1669,"Worst place in eagle river, dirty glasses dirty plates dirty menus even had food fall off a menu on to my hand. Will never return to this place."
1670,Meh.
1671,Beautiful drive
1672,"Love their strawberry cheesecake flavored ice cream as well as their chocolate peanut butter flavor. Decent prices for the quality of their products. Also, friendly staff and clean interior."
1673,"In and out, with what I need!!!!! That's how it's done!!!"
1674,"Short version review, Awesome!!!
Longer version haha....I haven't been on a bike for 7 years and was very reluctant to try again (had bad experience from crappy bikes,duh) After having being pregnant and nearly on bedrest/light duty the WHOLE second pregnancy (lost a lot of muscle) I was inspired to make a new goal in life for myself and family. I want to do a triathlon. Though it's been a LONG recovery process, I'm getting there, Trek is a great start!  I went to 6 different bike shops in Anchorage figuring I'd settle for an REI bike ($800) until I went to Trek (the last bike shop I was going to look at) WOW. First bike I road was the one I bought! ($550) which felt like the one at REI but better! It matched my budget and I didn't sacrifice on quality. The customer service has been fantastic, they have been very informative, patient and kind. I enjoy working with them and recommend them to everyone! Very reasonably  priced and there are no pushy salesmen!  No complaints! I've worked with Mike, Katie, Timely and Andy, all of which were fantastic. I'm sure the rest of them are just as great just haven't meant them yet... which I probably will cause it's awesome. Thank you Trek for helping me reach my goals and NOT being cycling snobs, keep up the great work and atmosphere."
1675,It was the first time I had ever been. The food was great. I had the blackened salmon Alfredo and my wife had the alaska fish and chips. Their beer batter was perhaps the best I've tasted in this town and my blackened salmon Alfredo was great( the salmon might have been overcooked a tad but nothing crazy). The bartender Bree was absolutely amazing. Our waitress is the only reason this place is getting 4 instead of 5 stars. She was quite short with us and seemed a little overworked. Everything else was amazing and the general manager even stopped by and had a short conversation with us making sure everything was OK. I'm going to have to visit this place soon and am looking forward to it!!!
1676,Dont bother ordering a steak
1677,"Clean and got to see a bald eagle, sea otters, and salmon in a stream."
1678,"Excellent service, authentic Mexican food and very friendly staff! We love Chico's!!!"
1679,"Everything you need in a local that's not to far to travel from cat and dog food and toys to chicken feed and feeders, to gift ideas your going to love and so much more, if you haven't stopped in yet it's worth your time."
1680,"Knowledgeable staff, friendly.  Greeted immediately, was asked if I needed help.  Offered choices in my field of interest.  Even wrapped the gifts for free.  They're awesome!"
1681,"Can‚Äôt beat a pit stop in the heart of the valley like that.. nice views, safe pull off area. Good place to safely stretch your legs"
1682,"Found what we needed, store seemed a little dirty"
1683,Biscuits and gravy was excellent!
1684,"Clean,  professional,  beautiful setting,  very polite."
1685,"Very good, prices are reasonable."
1686,Good selection of craft beer and good food for decent prices.
1687,Great place to rent for your event
1688,"Good customer service , best spicy , juicy , chicken in town , my favorite."
1689,Minus one star only because they didnt have beer.  Awesome food.
1690,Is there to check out their paraphernalia needed a new bong I just want to have to go check it out
1691,Nice little place
1692,Amazing place
1693,"Super friendly, painless experience. Definitely reccomend!"
1694,The go to when in Seward.
1695,"Love this store, i just hope its not going to shut down like every othet place"
1696,Free summer lunch
1697,Expensive place. But fun.
1698,The big store in town. They try hard and are very friendly.
1699,"Love these guys, especially their charter service."
1700,"It was really quiet when we were there. Clean, spacious, friendly staff, great food and I like some of their different dishes. We would eat there again."
1701,"I went with a friend. I havent been in this type of store in 15 yrs. So i went to look at everything and they carry such a wide varieity of things. Fron makeup, video games, clothes, dog food, tires, books, & more. I tried all the different food samples  some were better then others. But all the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. The store has easy to understand labels so u can make ur way around the store. The correct price of some items are not always clear which got lil confusing. But great quailty of products. I used self check out which was easy and quick.

But my BIG Grip.... they need Check Out Bags. I was pissed when i had to carry all my single items in my arms like an octopus. Only to set my stuff on my car seat. Rolling around on floorboards after the first turn i made driving home. Annoyed."
1702,Let‚Äôs all keep the park clean it‚Äôs great but a little dirty
1703,"My favorite Mexican store, WELL STOCK, the gentleman is very professional taking care of each customer and making sure the store is looking nice and clean, and giving precise information when asked about certain product ."
1704,"RV dump station is great, but they need access to fresh water..."
1705,"Friendly staff, bath room was pretty dirty and cold but the rest of the store was good and smelled clean. I tried the new Mango frozen thing and it was disgusting. Total waste of $2.00"
1706,"The best I've been to, and my girlfriend says it puts every shop in pad Vegas to shame. And she was ecstatic on the prices."
1707,"The big Juan burrito just wasn't that big, and wasn't that good.  The specials are inexpensive just not that good."
1708,Very talented and friendly
1709,Sushi is ok but not great quality.   fish portions on small side especially since nigiri and rolls pretty expensive.  Very pleasant staff and nice ambience.
1710,Great sushi and selection.  Inside is decorated very well.
1711,Cathy is the best! We love her and always enjoy seeing her.
1712,Good food and beer. Best spot in the airport.
1713,The pizza is to die for!
1714,"Tasty coffee served in a comfortable studious atmosphere. Lots of really beautiful photography on the wall. I walked around to each of them and read the little blurb that accompanied them. Definitely makes you want to get outside and explore!

I had the border mocha, a little ""spicier"" which was nice. Not really hot, just spiced like a wassel.

If you don't want want to go in they also have a little coffee cart in the parking lot."
1715,"Food was on point! The thin crust on the pizza was perfect, too! The service was not so great. Timely, but the wait staff was awkward. Mixed up orders, repeating the order to them several times as they were looking me in the eye, forgotten orders. They really need help with the wait staff. Kudos to the kitchen, though."
1716,"$4 beers where normally they are 550 or 6
Two fire pits center table out side
Had the burger with grilled peppers they were alright just threw on flat top would of been nice to been flame grilled.

There was one with steak and bacon was very good.

Fries are fancy looking but normal tasting steak fries.
Cowslaw delicious if you don't mind it tasting like pineapple."
1717,The staff is awesome especially Chelsea she is always so nice and helpful
1718,"Delicious foods, price is fair and staff is friendly. Comfortable atmosphere"
1719,Yoda was way excited to see his vet and find out about his surgery next week. Im sure he understands what i told him was going to happen. His whole demeanor changed after i told him he was losing his boys. Thank you for being patient with my fur child and me.
1720,"Nice facility, small classes, helpful and methodical instructors. I've taken two classes there so far, and they've been great at breaking down training techniques into clear and managable pieces. Very good at adapting to the dogs in front of them instead of demanding a one-size-fits-all approach."
1721,Breakfast is always very good here. Unlimited coffee and as much cream as I please.
1722,Quick service. Good good.
1723,Great
1724,Great information and great setup
1725,Always a relaxing great environment! The facials are very nice!
1726,"The stairs to enter are all a hot mess, lots of shops but little in the way of food options."

1729,Great food
1730,"Great little pizza place with patio seating. Best part, they even have vegan menu items!!"
1731,"Good experience, had good help
Got what I needed"
1732,Very clean. Landed from Anchorage this evening.. Only wish The lady on the plane had been seen he hawing down the isle behind the stewardess with her mask totally off.. She also has a face shield but again wasn't wearing it....Anyway the airport was through in asking passengers questions and all. Lots of staff present like beefed up security.. That's great for my safety.. Airport was somewhat crowed at luggage.. Maybe they need to look at that. Excellent gift store..
1733,I had a few questions and the guy was happy to answer them.
1734,"Long wait times are common here. I just went in there to  buy an entire front end for a ford power stroke. After waiting for 25 minutes or longer to get help, the 1st clue I was in the wrong place was when the parts attendant asked me if the power stroke was a Chevy. Basically I wasted 40 minutes of time there to walk out the door with nothing accomplished. Also earlier in the year ordered a remanufactured power steering gearbox assembly for an early 1999 7.3. I installed it and found out that it was the wrong one after being very specific on what I needed. I had to remove and re install the proper one; several hours wasted. I think I'm done shopping here."
1735,Good selection and helpful staff. Reasonable prices.
1736,"Delicious food, great service, wonderful quality, clean, organized, and I think the attention to detail is superb.
Setup to have a quick turnaround once ordered, the plating was fantastic and dishes themselves were outstanding. Definitely better than other options nearby. I would return based upon the staff alone."
1737,I‚Äôve tried their breakfast and some of their lunch/dinner entrees and it was so-so for me. Nothing special. Good portions and always friendly.
1738,"Good food,  nice folks!"
1739,Pizza is some of the best in town! Movies and beer? What more could you ask for.
1740,Decent commissary....lacks a variety of things...
1741,I always like McDonald's food and service.
1742,Buy shoes here
1743,Nice views and great hiking spots
1744,It's for business and sporting people ya know knock off the mud get the river dust/ salt silt off.
1745,"Great assortment of items. Everything from kimchi to squid in addition to the regular fare you would expect on a Chinese buffet. Price is a couple dollars higher than the Anchorage competition, but definitely worth it. You'll definitely leave satisfied and full!"
1746,"I've been here a couple of times and have never been disappointed. The Grizzly Burger is delicious, and you get a picture on the wall for completing the challenge. The staff is also super friendly which makes an already enjoyable experience so much better"
1747,Good food
1748,Yummy as always but the prices are getting high
1749,Always great food and friendly smiling faces!
1750,"The service was good and the barbecue, of course, but they also have an excellent tortilla soup at the Anchorage location."
1751,"A little crowded for me, but the food, service, and atmosphere were great"
1752,"Always a good place for a bite, but can get crowded."
1753,Excellant...the very best....

1755,"Service was quick, food hot, was seated quickly"
1756,Great burgers
1757,"Beautiful interior, it also has a pond you can look at in the back. There's a deck in the back with a few tables. Amazing food, I loved the fried zucchini, and very nice customer service. Has a pool table and dart game. Two musicians also showed up and my group and I enjoyed and had fun with them."
1758,"Probably don't need the guided tour, or the crimp-ons. But if you really want the maximum info, the guides do a good job.
This was our first time walking on a glacier. It was harder than I expected, and made this strange cracking noise when you walked on it.
The hike was pretty easy. But unstable individuals might be more comfortable with poles. Hiking boots a must."
1759,"Edit: The posole, dios m√≠o the posole. Best I've had outside of New Mexico.

Surprisingly good!  My new favorite Mexican restaurant in the state, and I've tried many if not most.  I always love a good salsa bar, and the food is on point.  It's tex mex rather than comida t√≠pica, but still worth a stop."
1760,Great people. Great live music.
1761,The octopus was amazing just wish it came with more.
1762,As delicious as I remembered.  Great place to eat.
1763,I was told I had full coverage until I was hit by someone else then geico told me I only had liability coverage
1764,"Adequate food, occasionally they run out on certain items, such as your bread choice, or vegetables, spinach, cucumbers.  Hours are shorter then the valley location.  Cheaper to dine here than most other places downtown."
1765,Service was great food was okay
1766,Excellent ride down the river.  Especially loved the visits with the dogs and the Athabasca village
1767,Great service and food.
1768,Loved the food. It was about a 30 minute wait (Sunday lunch time) but it was worth it he food was good and we loved having the gluten free and vegan options for those that needed it.
1769,Great food and atmosphere. The portions are massive!
1770,Besides forcing people to wear masks it's not a bad place to shop wearing masks and protecting yourself should be optional
1771,Located along the banks of Valdez Harbour. Comfortable rooms. Breakfast included. Advanced bookings recommended.
1772,Great service. Support local small business!
1773,Have no clue about this place.  Never stopped in but maps grabbed it up because I drove past it.

1777,"Nice , quiet ,good food and bar"

1779,They do a good job considering location.ots a bit old and tired. Good staff.
1780,One of the best cafes in Alaska!! Worth a trip to Kenai just for the breakfast crepes! Outstanding service!
1781,Great place to watch a show and do mushrooms
1782,Just a beautiful place!
1783,"Great breakfast, good service, extremely friendly and homey feel to the place. Food is great, portion size is large. Just what I want."
1784,"Food is fantastic.

Take out food can be considerably smaller than the portions you get when you order dine-in for the same cost."
1785,Wonderfully good food.
1786,Amazing food from appetizers to desserts.
1787,"While a bit expensive, the portions are enormous, the food is well worth every penny, and the atmosphere is pretty nice (although music is a bit loud sometimes for my taste). It's a great place to go for an Occasion (birthdays, anniversaries, what have you). Or if you want a pizza, they're in my top 3 on the island (jeepers, we have a lot of pizza places here)."
1788,A library with old newspapers and can rent out DVDs as well as books
1789,I don't drink any more but if I did I'd drink here.  Hang onto ur wallet tho.
1790,Easy to access with great views of Denali if the weather cooperates
1791,"I had been hearing ads for this restaurant on the radio and when I was in Homer last my husband and I had breakfast. I can't say enough about the environment, service and ohhh my goodness the food! I wish we could have ordered everything on their menu and I cannot wait to go back! Give it a try, you wont be disappointed."
1792,"Wonderful experience, cruise, glaciers, wildlife, views. Great service..they have a ranger on board as well. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff."
1793,Outstanding selection of grains and otherwise hard to find items.  Can be difficult to find an employee though if you don't know where items are
1794,Had a fish and chip platter....shy on fish mostly bread
1795,Lot of things inside
1796,I would take children there
1797,Good options of leathers and helmets
1798,"Great cross country ski in the winter, disc golf, running and biking in the summer"
1799,Great customer service
1800,Best mexican food we've had in a long while. Thanks!
1801,"The service was great, rooms were neat and food was pretty good. Plus you have a 2 drink ticket to start the night. Made with some strong drinks"
1802,"Quick, professional, great facility!  They send a yearly reminder card for my yearly Mammogram ‚Äî-and in the month of October they give you delicious truffles made in Palmer!!!  Sweetens the experience that‚Äôs for sure!"
1803,Best find of the entire trip.  Would definitely return.  The halibut cheeks were awesome!
1804,"Very fast service in a packed house and great food and beer, highly recommend it"
1805,"Homey feel, tasty food."
1806,predictably delicious authentic mexican food!
1807,Good food
1808,Really little else to say other than love! They are my spirit animal!
1809,Pretty neat place...
1810,"Outstanding for the money, but the wait can occasionally be an hour if they are busy. Tons of humans check-in online. They retain your prior haircut details on the computer so they can discern what you got last time without having to illustrate everything every time you go in. The ladies here have plenty of knowledge and experience and are friendly."
1811,Nice little park in the middle of town by City Hall. Very nice to see covered in snow. Little statues and area for strolling and walking. If you want a place to rest this is the place though in winter no shelter from the snow so it will be cold since the snow covers everything. Nice to visit.
1812,Always delicious. Plus they have some awesome margaritas.
1813,"Imagine your friends alcoholic father having a cheap bbq on one of those grills at a local park. Mac and cheese taste like something in a MRE. Chicken was drier than a vegan biscuit. The Brisket, however; was the highlight of my meal. Tender enough to feed to a seansoned meth user with no teeth due to years of drug abuse. Their house made sauces, is more comparable to Kroger brand sauce mixed with hose water stirred together with a dirty toilet brush. Overall it was alright."
1814,"I have been shopping there since they opened. The prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. $4 for kid pants with holes in them and bad stains, $15 for ones that do not. Cheaper and worth while to go to anther thrift shop or even WalMart or Fred Meyers. $160 for a table that has an IRON mark on it and several LARGE scratches. They stuff was DONATED to Value Village."
1815,"Shelves are empty 50% of the time. However, great prices. Night employees are polite."
1816,Cooper campground north was dope!
1817,No continental breakfast so thats a bummer for me
1818,This place reminds me of home in Hawaii. Great eats
1819,"Good prices, busy place."
1820,"Expensive, they do have big and tall sizes so that a plus. If Fred Meyers doesn't have what you are looking for check this place."
1821,"I started out by trying an e-quote on a RAV4 within 10 min I get a call from Mike. I explained what I was looking for so he told me to come down. From the minute I walked through the door Mike was right there to help me and answered any questions that I had, also asked a few of his own to try to fit me with the right car. After it was all discussed he stopped me from what I was about put myself through with a high milage car.There was no pressure if I didn't like something our if I looked uninterested we moved on he didn't try to just sell me anything. Instead he got me set up with a perfect brand new Jeep. All I said is I wanted it and Mike made sure I got it. Thanks Mike. If you are looking for friendly staff that won't bs you the whole way go here its a great place to find what you are looking for."
1822,So many options... everything is very good!
1823,"Worst breakfast burritos I've ever eaten both ends we're hard and dried out one was barely closed and the cheese was all stuck too the wrapper and this was at 7:30 am.
Wasn't worth the time I spent in line or the money I spent on it. Too bad it's the only place in town with a fast food breakfast  menu wish there was somewhere else to go we need a Jack In The Box in town.
And it should not have gone a star but it's the only way you can post your comments"
1824,Nice location
1825,Awesome
1826,I can't tell you how many times I have counted on this WG to provide me a late night refill!
1827,They have good deals. This time was different. Was followed by two different people. Have never stolen and was really creeped out. Finally stopped gave him dirty look and he left. Then a very irritating person clapping her hands did it.
1828,Traffic going in several directions and almost running into each other
1829,Always a great place for veggies.  Goodsele tion this time of year.
1830,Best donuts in Anchorage! Friendliest people waiting on you. Thank you!!
1831,"Great staff, creative and challenging rooms and puzzles, this place is fun. I've done two of the rooms they have and have had different experiences each time. The attention to detail is amazing and the work is all personally created by the owner. The rooms have incredible sets with clues hidden in plain sight and others hidden right under your nose but you don't notice them until some clue leads to another clue to another until it finally fits and tadaa a lock opens. I am looking forward to the next escape."
1832,"My favorite greasy spoon. If you are in the mood for a diner in Anchorage, there is no reason to go to any of the chain restaurants when you have this available. A great family restaurant run by a great family. The chicken fried steak is some of the best in town, and if you like real corned beef hash, this is the place to get it. I would love to say something about anything else on their menu, but I only order the two things - over and over again!"
1833,"Fast service, food came right to the car!"
1834,"I really wish this place had a bigger community or just a family vibe like the plaza workers of the movie ""Turbo"", but it'll most likely happen. Either this place needs to be reinnervated or it just needs to be burned down and replaced with something bigger and better. Overall it's just a decent place to shop and head to convenient places at. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1835,Crouded food ok
1836,Good food and nice atmosphere. A little bit pricey but has that old diner's vibe.
1837,The best pizza in Alaska.  Great atmosphere.
1838,Good food and good service with a beautiful view.
1839,Love it
1840,Great customer service and great food.  The young lady at the counter had very good customer service.  I‚Äôll definitely be coming back
1841,best place to play in town
1842,Excellent place for food in the area. Very similar menu to 49th state brewing company in Anchorage. I believe they are owned by the same people. Excellent food and service in an interesting atmosphere. Many good features on the menu to include their signature salmon bake to elk burgers.
1843,AIH is always the place to go when you need something!
1844,Good service. Attended a private work dinner. Staff was very professional. Portions were not quite filling though
1845,Loved it and the service was great.
1846,Best coffee so far
1847,Great hometown store good service.
1848,Huge selection and great prices
1849,Rental equipment is at a great price. You can enjoy a beautiful day on the water.
1850,Really great pizza. I wish they had a place is the lower 48. Nice selection of beers too. The sampler was a fun way to try a variety before settling in on one.
1851,üòéGreat place
1852,Tons of fun for the whole family!
1853,One of the few glaciers we saw
1854,Good beer and good food
1855,Best macarons in town!
1856,Good food and service
1857,I go here to change out tires for the summer and winter.  Service is always excellent and staff is very friendly.  Price is affordable as well.  Definitely recommend.
1858,Awesome helpful friendly staff good books lots of cool stuff for kids + Starbucks what's not to like plus they have a play area for kids
1859,"Crab legs perfectly cooked.  Carrot cake dry, tasteless.  Treana wine crisp, lovely."
1860,"Vicki is my absolute favorite stylist here, she always does a great job, and she is so friendly."
1861,Friendly staff and always able to find what I'm looking for and then some.
1862,"Very cool to eat and drink in a theatre. Also the movie selection is very diverse and the pricing for the tickets is not high. The food tasted well and was well portioned (huge Pizzas, at least for european standards!)."
1863,Very impersonable and unattentive staff. Place is messy too.
1864,"When you walk in to the restaurant it smells AMAZING. The food was reasonably priced, the food came out steaming hot and quickly. The California roll was very flavorful. The best I've tasted!"
1865,Many totem poles to view. Nice facility.
1866,"Good service, good food"
1867,The burgers and Sandwiches are delicious.  And remember to get a milk shake with your order
1868,"The clerk was Super-courteous: he offered services in a friendly tone and spoke clearly rather than speeding through a set of scripted remarks.
My transaction was simple, and he gave the impression of respecting my time and not over complicating the process."
1869,Great atmosphere!!
1870,The hotel is okay. Good service and nice views. But it is out of the way from the rest of the town and would have preferred something more centrally located since we didn't have a car.
1871,Bought some nice yarn.
1872,Good food good service
1873,Overpriced
1874,"Awesome food, great views, and remarkable atmosphere. Staff is great! Otg loves this place!"

1877,My wife never leaves!
1878,Good for walking and cross country skiing
1879,They have delicious food and a great friendly staff!
1880,Always a positive experience and treat me fairly. I've gotten bad news but at least they're straight about it.
1881,Great local place to eat
1882,"Convenient, clean, service...."
1883,Don't come here expecting regular steakhouse ambience. This is more like an 80s dive bar. The staff are dressed in tshirts and aren't very courteous. The lack of service nearly ruined my birthday dinner. Won't be back.
1884,Been with them for 2 years  now and I couldn't be happier.  I love working with them and they are very curtious and easy to talk to/work with. Would highly recommend them.
1885,Great family ran station. Great staff too.
1886,Good food
1887,"Great servicel, good food"
1888,How sweet it is
1889,The hotel is nice and the rooms are comfortable. The staff is friendly. The location is great.
1890,"One of the nest Carrs in town, despite its location. The staff does a very good job interacting with customers and heading off problems before they arise. Plus, out of every store in this area, they have consistently great sale items."
1891,"Good food, a bit pricey, depends on what kind of food you order"
1892,Big time bill big time. Lol
1893,For the hometown barbershop experience with amazing people and the best cuts in town
1894,"If you're looking for low prices then Walmart is your next stop.  I found vacuum cleaner bags at Walmart while Fred Meyers has none.  The store is easy to navigate, but the checkout section is confusing because the registers aren't in a line.  I think the staggered registers make it difficult to see and move to an open register.  The employees are polite and helpful, but remember to keep your receipt handy because you'll be asked for it before you leave the store.

If this review was helpful please click the Like button."
1895,It's great as always when I come here
1896,Very friendly staff
1897,Best cocktails in town.
1898,A historic cabin in Fairbanks. Sometimes not in the best repair but cheap to rent for the area.
1899,Tasty food! I ordered the pork chop and their pho!
1900,"This was a very expensive buffet, the food was alright, but I am not used to paying that much for a meal."
1901,"An affordable tent & RV campground right on the beach! Imagine a $10/day campsite (as of June 2017) and setting up a campfire right on the beach, roasting your hotdogs or smoores on an open firepit as you see and hear the waves crashing a few feet from your feet. When the low tide comes, you and your kids can venture out 500 feet or more and collect shells that were just recently under 10 feet of water a few hours earlier. When you want, you can then hit the board walk on Homers' Spit."
1902,"Food was way too expensive to be so mediocre. Had the shellfish fettuccini, and while it had flavor, it was lacking in anything that made it jump out. It's a $30 pasta dish, it should be absolutely delicious."
1903,Awesome yogurt.
1904,Crowded.
1905,"I recommend the creme brulee cream filled doughnut, for sure. It was a neat twist and executed to perfection with fresh ingredients, and a soft, pillowy dough. My friends and I got 3 for just about the price of 2, what a deal!"
1906,Lovely mall
1907,"Staff are superb, food is first class."
1908,Price seems really steep for the quality of food they have.
1909,No self serve
1910,Love Mexican food and Margaritas on hot sunny days
1911,Amazing the restaurant here are amazing and the hotel is awesome
1912,Great spot I highly suggest visiting in winter through Alaska mushing school
1913,"Delicious food, big portions!"
1914,"Steep trail, a little hard to follow as there are paths everywhere.  The view from the top is awesome!"
1915,"Only 4 stars because a couple times now ive gone and had a dirty room but staff is very accomodating and very understanding and helpful, i love this place its my favortie hotel in anchorage and they have handicap accessible rooms and such. Lobby is always clean and they have a Convenience store next to the front desk and they serve breakfast starting at 6am.
Due to covid there is a 15 person limit in the pool which makes it difficult to even have a chance to get in there they need to go back to reserving the pool and hottub so everyone has a chance to get in the pool.

They have an outdoor heated(giant gas firepit) smoking area with a nice view during any season but they do need to work on keeping it clear of snow and ice in that area during the winter season. Sidewalks and such are nice and clear and usually dry so safe to walk on in winter"
1916,lots of worthwhile useful cheap stuff but smells too perfumy
1917,Beautiful place. Very serene with some lovely views of the ocean and mountains. The Shrine is also wonderful to take in.
1918,Great historic center along with great information.
1919,Price and location can‚Äôt be beat.
1920,Good place to do business with. Clean and friendly.
1921,Only problem I had was getting a free pizza on my Birthday...
1922,Small portions poor service expensive prices cold food
1923,"The Individuals at Jack Sprat always do a great job.
I can say they do the best Irish Coffee that I've ever ordered at an establishment. The atmosphere contrast between the rooms is very nice! The prices are very reasonable and I've  never had a disappointing moment there. Hopefully on my next review I'll actually have photos to post.
Thanks guys!"
1924,The gentleman working there was a bit ride about wearing masks and taking cash only. I knew we needed a mask and that they take cash. I was just kidding about those two important things and I guess he did not like that. Then when we left he followed us out for some reason. I guess to check the car?
1925,I come here for the sandwiches and they are fantastic and very reasonably priced. They also carry some fantastic pastries and cured meats.
1926,"I have been to many chiropractors over the years in a few different states. This is the best chiropractic office I've ever been in. I love how streamlined everything is. I usually have no trouble getting in without an appointment, which can be difficult for me to make since I live out in the valley and run a couple of businesses. Oh, and did I mention I drive all the way from the Wasilla to go here! I've tried other chiropractors, but they all want exorbitant fees to get you started in their office. Dr. Lloyd made it easy to get started and easy to get in every time. He does an amazing job and it's clear he really loves what he does and cares about his clients - that's what keeps me coming back."
1927,Top of the line for all your pet needs  üêæ
1928,Good food.
1929,Cheap parts good rewards program
1930,Nothing  there but everything for this part of the world.
1931,The best place for coffee
1932,Hot n fresh n delicious
1933,The place to stay in Tok! The rooms are clean but a bit outdated. They serve their purpose. Pet friendly and the restaurant across the way is delicious. Definitely convenient and affordable.
1934,The greatest place to shop. Once they know you they treat you like family. I love it there
1935,Anything a girl could dream of!
1936,Best Starbucks staff!
1937,"Delicious food, small/medium portions, but friendly service. Worth trying for sure."
1938,"Always delicious, and always takes a bit to get through the line"
1939,"Two of the front office people are fine to deal with, but the manager is absolutely terrible. Not sure who thought she was a good choice for that position, but boy were they wrong. I thought customer service positions actually required decent customer service, but NOPE.

Front office issues aside, the other tenants (at least in our building) seem oblivious to the fact that there are multiple tenants in each building. One of our neighbors is smoking in their unit and it makes our bathroom and the back part of our apartment REEK like cigarette smoke. Oh, and when I mentioned this to the office they said ""Northpointe doesn't have a policy against smoking inside the unit"". Awesome.

Our newest neighbors have like 8 people staying in their 2 bedroom apartment. This past Saturday, one of their friends passed out on our stairwell and wouldn't wake up. We couldn't get our dogs down the stairs to let them outside, neither could our neighbor.

This morning, two native people were sleeping in the stairwell, again completely blocking it so there wasn't enough space for our dogs to get by them, and I had to step over them on my way to work.

Lastly, there has been a mom and baby moose on the property for about two weeks now. Some of the tenants will either try to get as close as possible and some have even been throwing rocks/sticks at it. While part of me prays you get charged by the mom moose, the other part of me knows that this is why moose get put down -- idiots antagonizing it until it gets aggressive, and then F&G shoots it. This is Alaska -- occasionally we run in with wildlife, let them mind their own business and you do the same.

Anyways, I've also read multiple posts recently about Northpointe lowering monthly rates for new tenants, and when older tenants have asked why their rent wasn't lowered, they were told they can move out of their unit and into a new one in order to get lower rent. Again, not sure how accurate this is but it really wouldn't surprise me if it is true.

DO NOT EVER MOVE IN HERE."

1950,"I thought I had torn a muscle in my shoulder, but it wasn't healing. So, I had Dr. Smith take a look at it. It turned out the shoulder joint was out of place. 3 days later my shoulder feels great again, after a month and a half of pain. I should have seen him much sooner."
1951,Fun
1952,They love your animals like their own. Great space and always informative on pet care. My fluffy butt loves it there!!

1954,One of the guys started going whack and talking to himself the construction workers when they first built the Victoria secret Then security was like what's going on man then he told him to go outside
1955,It was my autistic children's 15th birthday yes I know they look like twins I couldn't tell if they were having fun but the sounds they made sounded like it
1956,Didn't even know this place existed. Great selection and friendly knowledge staff
1957,"This was the first time I ever went to Peanut Farm, and I must say, I was not disappointed AT ALL. The waitress (Tif) was absolutely amazing, easily the best I'd had the pleasure of in over ten years anywhere. The service and speed from the kitchens was absolutely on par. The food itself was Incredible, even what I sampled from other dishes at the table. Every bit was unique and made to order, going above and beyond by providing a mini ""snack tray"" to my 9mo of little things to sample (a couple pickles, which she adores, an orange slice, some cherries, and she happily swiped food from the rest of us too). I will DEFINITELY be back, hopefully many many times! I live on the Peninsula, and it is worth the 3-4 hour drive to eat there."
1958,Polite. Helpful. I will definitely use them next time always!
1959,Use your card and save
1960,"We have called for pick up orders and experienced really bad services. We were told to hold, but never heard any music playing or a dead silence. We heard sounds of a phone being put in a pocket and ignored. It went on for almost 10 minutes, then we hung up. We tried their other locations and got the same response. We no longer will continue being their customers."
1961,"Had a nice experience checking out. The cashier was pleasant. Prices are definitely higher here than more easily accessible towns in Alaska, as is to be expected. They have a good selection and variety though."

1967,Great burgers!
1968,"My car had damage from a Hit and Run. Chaz was recommended by my insurance. Chaz staff has great communication, I was updated on my car's status throughout the whole process. They even gave me advice on what to do for a small time fix on my other vehicle. Professional. Courteous. The quality of their work is awesome and they even vacuumed out my car. (Bonus points)"
1969,Love Mexican food?  You should be happy here.  If your looking for a place for a small gathering. Call for info.  Great food and service is great.
1970,Lovely. Best in the morning in the winter after it snowed.
1971,Tiny rooms. No AC in room so you'll need to leave the sliding door open for any air. We had to deal with the ton of road noise and 17 hours of light to keep cool. There are almost no horizontal surfaces in the room to put things on. Bathroom sink in hallway is so low it could be an end table. Tiny TV. Deck with overgrown bushes yielded no view and a herd of no-see-ems. Formica like walls. All of the conviences of 1980 with Wifi. Outdated decor and worn interior. Excessively average for an above average price.
1972,"When my girlfriend asked me my favorite burger, I replied : Carl's Jr."

1985,"Food is fast, Simi gold depending on day"
1986,Only gas station in Barrow..Prices for gas is higher than the rest of America..Hint hint..
1987,Favorites
1988,"I picked this auto shop because of the high review ratings.. they replaced my alternator on my Subaru. After reviewing the work they had done and the bill I received I realize they charged me $270 for an alternator I could have picked up on my own for a hundred bucks. Having said that my real complaint is the fact that my belts were not tightened fully and give off horrible squeals anytime my car set at idle or when I turn my lights on. Today I went out and bought a socket set and fix the problem myself. While I believe in second chances, I feel the case in Auto Repair it should be right the first time. I later went to someone I know and found a place that would have done it for less money and had it done correctly the first time. Live and learn"
1989,When you need most things at a good price this is the place to go.

2008,Good food and place
2009,"A Subway attached to a furniture store? Why not? Fresh food, cheerful staff, and fast service. Can't go wrong there.
The floor and our table were sticky though, which could have been due to the high volume of diners. But it would be nice to sit down at a clean table to eat."
2010,Quiet and a comfortable feeling
2011,Great free skiing
2012,"Fastest service, placed my order and before I got my drinks to the table the food was on the way! Hands down the best burger I've had in Anchorage. The burgers are large, the toppings are fresh and only the ones you want, your burger the way you want it, not some clowns way. üòÅüòÅ"
2013,$2 movies on Tuesdays and half off popcorn
2014,Love to visit this place once every summer
2015,Surprisingly good. After a decade of not eating Taco Bell this was good enough to visit twice within 4 days. They did not have an item listed on their website as available at the location that I visited.
2016,A beautiful lake in a beautiful area. It was peaceful and quiet. The views are great. Decent fishing the first day of our trip.
2017,Long lined
2018,"What a great bar! When you walk in, it's very 1950s with vinyl everywhere. We sat down at the bar and the bartender named Josh took great care of us. He was very knowledgeable with just the right amount of bartender sass. He had us laughing for the hour we were there. He makes great margaritas! The restaurant portion has great food. The chowder is delicious, as is the halibut burger and the chocolate cake."
2019,Very friendly Place. Find all kinds of Funko Pops t-shirts anything that  exciting and new
2020,Worst customer service with evening cashier.  Just a mean person really can't believe she is in customer service
2021,"Other than being a little pricey, this was fantastic. Friendly staff, fast fresh food. The meal I got (can't remember the name) was perfect, the noodles were wonderful. Been craving it ever since, I will be back!"

2028,"Always a good place to do a ""little"" shopping, fast friendly service as well!!!"
2029,"I like to head to AK express to take care of my DMV needs, there is rarely a line and when there is it moves fast. It is so much better than going to the dmv and sitting around for an hour to get title transferred. my only complant is there used to be at a different location and when they moved I had no idea where they went. If you move your business across town put out a sign or advertise  where you went."
2030,"Love Costco, Southside has the best coffee selection"
2031,"My son, a verified rock mogul from birth (he's now 8), begged me to stop in here so he could check out their collection of rocks and gems. I have to say, the owner was very special. Where anyone else might pass him off as a joke she spent time helping him select his gems and taught him how to choose the best ones. She has everything from necklaces, bracelets, and a large assortment of gems to spiritual statuettes and incense. According to the locals, its the best place to find citrine in the fall when the darkness comes (known for its bright sunshine energy)."
2032,"Excellent local diner, you won't find many tourists here but that's what's good about it. Great food, especially the French toast, friendly service, nice feel. Bathroom could use a little work."
2033,"Ok Burger, portions are way too small for the too high prices."
2034,Great tasting food at a great price. Best teriyaki I've had in Anchorage.
2035,Bessie was the best give her a raise...
2036,ITs just the best place!

It is such a pleasure to wake up to less pain now. I have Improved in. My mobility. Thanks so much."

2043,"Very good, helpful place to shop.   Get to know them, they are fun loving while being professional."
2044,I'm addicted to the cheeseburger omelette.
2045,Great subs best in the valley!
2046,They didn't have a working air compressor...so they couldn't rotate my tires or even fill them up.
2047,"Awesome spot to walk, run, ride, play with the kids and pets. Short walk to the beach and  plenty of soccer fields. Good hills for sledding down in the winter."
2048,Prices are all over the place at this store. I have seen items stay for weeks on the shelf because they are priced within a few dollars of new. You can still find bargains but you have to work at it.
2049,Most definitely scrumptious breakfast food .
2050,Nice airport. The disabled / wheelchair assistance was excellent and appreciated!
2051,Great little diner - food was excellent
2052,Very expensive
2053,Very nice staff.  Good selection
2054,Went there last night for the 1st time.. the chicken was to salty.  The seated area by the lanes are way to small... not built for a family event at all... we squeezed by each other all night due to the tight space. They dont have surround sound for the music so if your on the last lane good luck. No A/C so if you get hot you will have to go infront a fan. Majority of the Bowling balls dont have the sizes on them. They do offer military discount though.
2055,"Good cup of iced Joe. Peppermint Frappuccino was good, got me going. Worker accidentally put a bit too much peppermint asked me if it was too much, said ya a bit so he made me and better one a size up. Thank you!"

2060,"Best selection in Anchorage, SK."
2061,Amazing food simply amazing
2062,"I took someone here to buy tobacco supplies a few weeks ago. I really know nothing about liquor stores, but this one seemed clean, well-stocked, and conveniently located. The workers were professional and courteous."
2063,Come on it's just McDonald's
2064,It was amazing!
2065,"Great food, service and drinks!"
2066,drinks are good but the food quality sure wasn't what it used to be years ago.
2067,Service was good
2068,"If you're not fishing or running the mountain marathon, a wildlife cruise is not a bad thing to do.  Seward is a town that thrives on tourism and fishing.  The days was rainy and the swells outside resurrection bay were 6-9 feet, so we hit this cruise.  We weren't disappointed.  The crew was extremely polite and professional, and the ship was very clean (it's not a fishing vessel, after all).  Kaighlee was our captain and narrator, and she's knowledgeable about the the local wildlife, the town, it's economy, and it's history.  Jacob and antonia were our 1st mate and steward; we didn't interact with them at all but they were all smiles and very helpful to all on board.  Five minutes into the cruise and we had already seen a few seal otters, a seal, and a humpback whale.  We learned about the different glaciers in the bay, and how the bay was created.  Then we see a pod of killer whales, and they came really close to the boat.  It was awesome.  By the next of the tour, we saw the orcas, eight humpback whale, stellar sea lions, coastal mountain goats, dolphins, and learn a bit about Seward.  If you're in town and you take a day off from fishing, I'd recommend taking one of these tours.  We did the 3 1/2 hours tour, but they have others that are longer and include meals.  Either way, you can't go wrong with it."
2069,My place
2070,Was ALRIGHT BUT for a Delivery  they said 1 price & when delivered it was way different!! And food  was not all that great for that store. EMPLOYEES are  in a hurry & not friendly.
2071,Great food and atmosphere. Best pizza in town
2072,"Great place to buy meat products in regards to selection and price, but very bad place to buy perishable items (bread, cakes, and etc) as it was expired or tasted spoiled. Offers a few alternative choices to some products but does not come anywhere close to Wal-Mart.  Dead zone for cell phone service at least with AT&T, so if you want to do research or price comparison move close to the entry doors to obtain a bar.  If not be prepared for your phone receive a lot of messages and missed calls once you exit the store.  In other states or cities the surcharge is a better trade off but here its a penalty as Fairbanks does not charge city taxes."
2073,AWESOME
2074,The philly cheesesteak enrolls are too good
2075,Beware of take out. My home is five mintues away from their Abbot location but they've never been able to deliver in less than an hour. They always say they get lost...I dont have this problem with any other delivery places.
2076,"Alaskan owned. Family owned. Really important in such a small community. Great atmosphere, excellent service."
2077,I would highly recommend Anita. I enjoyed my time there very much; she makes sure you're comfortable ( not so easy when you're getting a BrazilianüòÖ) and the atmosphere is wonderful.
2078,"Good atmosphere, polite staff."
2079,The place is nice  good food in the restaurant. Wifi was really slow though .49 Mbps was the fastest download speed I could get. üòí
2080,"Good service, interesting menu, excellent clam chowder."
2081,Great selection
2082,Peaceful
2083,Pick another hotel
2084,"Great upstairs party room where you can enjoy a bar and buffet style for just your troop away from the regular dinning area.

Also the staff was attentive to needs and didn't complain when kids were having fun in the dinning area next to is.

Food is good - great selection of salsa!"
2085,"Great food and drinks, usually good service."
2086,Had me sitting inside on  a crappy little uncomfortable bench over 45 min only to serve me cold food they finished making 35 min prior but forgot who it was for
2087,It's expensive
2088,"This place cleans my system out really good, but not my toilet so much."

2099,Great food
2100,"The place is blooming with local kindness~! People tend to be really familiar in this place! The place has really great service and I can‚Äôt get over the fact of how the whole atmosphere gives a friendly feel. The food is also so delicious, some of the food you get gives off a fresh sound when you bite into it, like the sandwiches. One bite and you hear a ‚ÄúCrrrrnnnccchh‚Äù, it‚Äôs so satisfying just sitting in this restaurant. It‚Äôs a must to come here weekly as a local!"
2101,Was 70 mph gusts white caps on the river to match the mountains. Had a big brown stalking us. Was a great time and didn't catch a fish. Wouldn't trade it for a day at work ever.
2102,Nice place for a coffee drink or to smell moist soil in January and dream of summer.
2103,Good store. Sketchy parking lot
2104,"This place has a wonderful 50's vibe and aesthetic to it. It's a great place to kick back, relax and enjoy the blast to the past and the food to go with it. Prices are average and the food is great, so that makes for a deliciously economical good time. And a jukebox! How could you not like a jukebox!"
2105,Awesome glacier trail.
2106,They are my fix it shop For my Western snowplow and they are right down the street from my house
2107,What's to say it's a car wash but it's the only one around is bad good for your car though

2109,I like the many convenient locations.
2110,Great service very helpful and fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2112,Really sweet people working there. Great help!
2113,Love the people working here!
2114,This location does not honor damn near any national advertisements (applicable where accepted) they do honor rewards points though. Nice selection of local brews.
2115,Fresh handmade donuts to die for
2116,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this donut shop!! It's got the flavor (better in my opinion) of the large corporate shops while simultaneously providing a fun and exciting atmosphere that children can come and enjoy while being relaxing, safe, and beautiful enough that parents and those without children can enjoy hanging out and having a delicious and filling BREAKFAST or LUNCH!!! üòä‚ù§Ô∏è I CAN'T WAIT to come back again!! üòç"
2117,"The big bad Chugach has all you could want in a national Forest. Great trails, well kept facilities where applicable, tons of space to roam, and berries galore!"
2118,I like the spacious areas of the parking lot.
2119,Love the fettuccine soooooo much
2120,"The movie was fantastic & the staff was cool. But the seats are uncomfortable & the nachos are too expensive. . . .but that's not a surprise, the food at theaters is always too expensive, so what are you gonna do."
2121,Went for dinner with my husband. Server was very kind and attentative but my food was garbage. My husbands cheap plate was fresh and tasted ok. My very expensive seafood plate wasn't even room temperature as if it was prepared for someone else then left sitting under a heat lamp for 3 hours. Highly dissapointing.
2122,Love the mall
2123,"Excellent hotel to stay at in Seldovia for 2 or 3 nights rather than going over on a day boat taxi then having to leave back to Homer at 4PM the same day.  Lots of birding and nature viewing, great beaches, fishing, huge tides, wonderful restaurants, a pretty town!  The Boardwalk Hotel food is delicious, the rooms nice and clean, and the staff are the friendliest.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2124,Taco hell
2125,"Quite rooms, easy parking, convenient location, t.v. remote broken and cable lacking variety of channels, refrigerator wabbles and the desk had poor communication between night shift and day shift."
2126,"This is one of my favorite spots to treat myself  I usually get a burger to eat in and a slice of carrot cake togo....

I love the atmosphere especially when the kitchen is blaring oldies I celebrated my birthday there today and got to sit at my favorite table and ate my favorite burger thanks Tommy's burger stop"
2127,Good place for Mexican food.  Regular customer
2128,You get what you get in a toys r us but the customer service is sub par.  A shining star or 2 but overall I wasn't pleased.
2129,"This place is great! It has something for every level. Just beginning or already an expert? Too cold to go outside? Ascension Rock Club is the place! The staff are great, very friendly and are a wealth of information. Rock climbing is just a fun work out in general."
2130,Amazing Place
2131,Good selection of drinks
2132,"I brought in a broken big toe I named Tommy (from the Martin show, 90's). Left with a boot that makes me walk like a Frankenstein with more confidence that I am old and it takes a lil longer to heal. Friendly, easy to find, Very Clean, easy to find way around inside to. Thanks Again."
2133,"Friendly and fast service at the bar. The server comped my beer before I could say anything when it came in a larger size glass than I ordered. I wasn‚Äôt going to complain, especially about getting more beer, but that‚Äôs going above and beyond in my book. I look forward to coming back and exploring their menu."
2134,Good place to find most anything you need
2135,Fast service
2136,If you want beautiful scenery on the water this is the place! Wildlife viewing from your rv. Spots for water and electric were on my $20 a night. No sewer hookups. Bathhouse on site but may be a walk depending on where you park. Couldn't get any wifi. Location and scenery is well worth it!!
2137,"(Translated by Google) In every respect for praise.

U svakom pogledu za pohvalu."
2138,The food is simple but the flavors are amazing. Flaky crust and quality ingredients.  Go for the sides and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. It‚Äôs surprisingly filling.  The owners are very friendly and engage all of their customers. Great service every time.  I love that you can also take food for later.   We‚Äôll be back again!

2144,Good for the price
2145,"Great vibe, great coffee, and open late during the school year. What more could one ask for?"
2146,"We had some pretty bland Thai food on our first night in Fairbanks, but with so many Thai places here I wanted to give the city another chance.  Eating at Bahn Thai was a definite improvement, and pretty good.  It wasn't the very best I've had, but it was solid.  The husband's was pretty bland, though.  I think we'd definitely give it another shot, and it was definitely the better of the two we ate at while in Fairbanks."
2147,Love this place!!!
2148,Almost the only place to buy computer components in town. Services lacking in some areas. Great prices since they match with amazon ship and sold by.
2149,Nice and clean
2150,Great product kind of expensive . Not overly joyful your there.
2151,Decent food. I had the crab cakes and they were good. Prices are ok a little high but it's Alaska. Worth the visit.
2152,Mmmmm.... southwestern Bacon Burger
2153,"We had a blast with Rod. He is an A+ professional guide. We booked an all day snowmobile tour in the White Mountains. This was our first time snowmobiling and it couldn‚Äôt have gone better. Rod made sure we were comfortable on the sleds before starting and he led us on an unforgettable adventure. The trails were fun and very manageable for first timers, they were recently groomed which made it easier. We did a 100 mile round trip!

2154,Best curry I have ever had. Staff is very nice and helpful too
2155,"Best pizza on the peninsula. Affordable lunch, six dollars two slices and a soda, from noon till 4. Delivery and carry out, also inexpensive, best deal for the best pie."

2157,AMAZING
2158,Great view
2159,Great variety.  Love having titles available from local authors and Alaskan topics.
2160,"This is a fun place to take your kids. The slides are great and the pool and hot tub are nice. The lazy river is fun too !
The facility itself though.....is disgusting. So much rust !! The railings on the stairs have rusted completely through on some parts , and their way of fixing it is taping it together. A 9 year old in our group cut himself on the stair lip on the stairs going up to the higher slides ( Rusty and sharp ) and started bleeding.  The price is WAY TOO HIGH FOR WHAT IT IS !!!!!!! We had a fun time overall , so I feel bad leaving a 3 star , but I'm hoping that with enough negative reveiws they'll take some of that money they are taking in and re do the place, because as of now it looks like they are trying for a ""sunken shipwreck "" look ."
2161,Yummy
2162,Park your car here and walk about half mile to walk onthe ice and take photos.
2163,üëç
2164,The gentleman and lady whom work there are so amazing and helpful.and don't mind how long it takes me to find what makes me feel good so patient and very help always answering my week ask a lot embarrassing for me but I wish more people were as kind here's a few of styles that I go to.them.for
2165,"Got a barbecue brisket sandwich, which was delicious. However, service was not very fast and fries were barely warm when they arrived at the table."
2166,Fast food
2167,"Good food and great service.  Prices a bit high given the overall experience.  Very loud environment made conversation difficult.  Dining here was a pleasant experience, but shy of 5 stars for me."
2168,"This place is Awesome!
Authentic  Thai food, its delicious!
Great  service , and cozy  decor.
I Would Recommend  This Excellent restaurant ."
2169,"Friendlier staff than usual. Ordered at a kiosk, worked well."
2170,The washers ate my money.
2171,Awesome gym. Everything is brand new and the staff were friendly.
2172,East side is the best Fred's in Fairbanks
2173,"Favorite grocery store in Wasilla Palmer area, clean, good produce, and freebies each week if you get their app :)"
2174,Good fast food. Right up there with Wendy's. Service can be a little slow but it's good food overall with minimal mistakes.
2175,Awesome place!! We saw so many animals really close up. One of the highlights of our trip; we‚Äôre so glad we stopped to check it out!
2176,It's got a beautiful view of the lake and the wait staff was good--our waitress was excellent. Had the mushroom burger which was delicious and enjoyed the atmosphere.
2177,"The last three times I've gone there it's put water on my truck and that's about it at best, the last time it stopped halfway through on the first wash and told me to exit. I called the phone number to get my money back or a real wash, impossible to answer or return calls!"
2178,The service department is the best! And the shuttle van guy is so fun (= Chris Kemp is a super knowledgeable and fun guy
2179,Denali is a beautiful natural National Park and is worth the trip.
2180,Everything in one place with friendly staff and quick checkouts
2181,"Excellent pub food! Beer and mixed drinks, entrees. Plenty of room inside and out. Would definitely recommend."
2182,Always a great place to fuel up.. thanks for keeping the prices low
2183,They  have the basic essentials but they can get you what you need in a day or 2 of you need a specialty item. They can be busy at times but a great spot to stop in if you need something for your vehicle.
2184,"One of the most beautiful places in Alaska in my opinion. The sheer vastness allows for areas to appear untouched by humans. Staying at a campground in the park is a must-do for any summer Alaskan visit. I would definitely recommend taking the bus to wonder lake, that is a great scenic drive as well as the best campground in the park. The views of Denali from there are spectacular."
2185,Easy place to shop.  Needed lumber cut and an associate was ready to help immediately.  Thanks for a great experience.
2186,"It was a regular experience for the excellent one that I had before, the menu was not very varied and the person who attended to me was not very friendly at all, when ordering I asked for a starter and it didn't take any more until he brought it,  making us wait to order the main course, at lunchtime it was not what I expected, looking like half of the ration that had always been served in other places, I hope they improve the service since this restaurant is one of the best personally  ."
2187,Barnes & Noble Has completely renovated their store. The floor space is very attractive you can actually see most of the books. The restaurant coffee area is open with tables spaced far apart. Everyone is wearing masks.
2188,Good food!
2189,This is the only carrs store I love  my family  works with  them
2190,"I see potential in this place but I‚Äôm overall disappointed at the moment. Some of the staff members always seem like they can‚Äôt stand being there and can‚Äôt stand customers. They also need to be more strict with parents just letting their toddlers and/or preschoolers loose while they‚Äôre on their phones or chit chatting with other parents and not paying attention. I had one incident where a preschooler was bullying my son in the bounce house but his parent(s) were nowhere to be found so I had no choice but to scold and tell him to stop.

The trampolines are fun, the arcade area I haven‚Äôt paid attention to but my little ones love it, they also enjoy the bounce house, there‚Äôs also a little obstacle course which they love, our oldest loves the rock wall area. There‚Äôs also snacks/drinks you can purchase and they let us bring in food due to our kids‚Äô allergies. Other than the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs bathrooms they have a family bathroom with a diaper changer in it. They need to improve on their customer service skills and they‚Äôre also pricey."
2191,"Good relaxing atmosphere, love it"
2192,Very small seasonal town for tourists
2193,Great place to shop
2194,Litty
2195,Fun park with history
2196,Cheaper than twin cities and they provide great quality service

Lunch is amazing and their dinner, although a bit pricier, is always great!

2200,Amazing üçï
2201,"they have fresh Asian veggies that other stores don't carry. But horrible return policies, and sometimes have expired food. They Take advantage over COVID-19 and not accepting any product return even if product is damaged or expired."
2202,Big chain box
2203,This place has so much. If you're looking for an East meets West grocery experience then this is the place to go.
2204,Love this theater
2205,Fantasic place to get all your crafting supplies
2206,"Delicious barbecue! I waited too long to stop by and give this place a chance. Brandon and Shawn are awesome and make some awesome food. Their ribs were very much falling off of the bone and perfectly seasoned. Their pulled pork sandwich was also very good! There are always people there for a reason! In addition to taste, their prices are very fair, especially for the Seward area. Give these guys a shot and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2207,"Employees are always distracted, taking about gaming. There is one guy there that seems uncaring and almost robot  like. Med height, dark hair. I think his name was Philip? But over all I would give it a 2. Service would be 1."
2208,Great time.  Helpful staff.
2209,Great service a excellent sandwiches
2210,Great place to camp in Valdez! Beautiful views. You can purchase glacier tour tickets here as well. Military campers/RVs available through the MWR.
2211,"As someone that lives in Alaska, I am still in love with the park and go more than once a year. This is truly one of the world's treasures. It is the only place in the world with blond bears and Dall sheep. I have seen wilderness in action that would be worthy of a Nat Geo special. The mountain (Denali) doesn't show itself everyday, but the park has so much more to offer that it is little disappointment if a trip doesn't result in a viewing. I can't say enough good things.  Just go!"
2212,"Food was good, not great. Service was slow. Decent beer selection."
2213,Nice and so cold.
2214,"The only place in town for great sandwiches, coffee, tea, and baked goods."
2215,Lunch was great wait staff was extremely helpful definitely recommend.
2216,Called to ask about a product. The employee cut me off before I had even asked my question. Went in anyway. No employees to be found to direct me to what I was looking for. Wandered the store about 10 - 15 minutes and left. Never saw a single employee. Would not spend my money here.
2217,Excellent concert space.
2218,The devils canyon tour is simply amazing.

2221,Scary not a place to relax and have a drink bad prices
2222,"The Fairfield was clean and comfortable. Good bed, nice linens, good towels. The breakfast was fresh and had lots of variety. I just had Raisin Bran, but saw lots of other high quality offerings. The front desk staff were super friendly and helpful!üòä

The air conditioner was super noisyüòû, but worked.

The room darkening curtains were an important feature with 20 plus hours of daylight.

All in all a good stay."
2223,16 check stands and only 1 open. 20 minute wait time.
2224,"Try not listing a two topping pizza as any 2 extra large, order expecting what it says and get one pizza for more expensive than a regular special."
2225,Really great camping spot! One of my favorite places we have stayed at - lots to see and do and it‚Äôs very relaxing.
2226,"Interesting organization and quality control. Seat yourself, but then have to go to a window to order. There is a staff member who clears tables, seats, and brings chips, so 90% the waitress/hostess, but doesn't handle food.
Food was good, sounds like horchata is an in demand item there.
Grabbed a cup that had items stuck to it. Meaning no one is checking the dishes. It wasn't terribly small either. I just picked it off and went about life, just raises some questions."
2227,Average food. Customer Service needs help
2228,"The place is a mess! Clothes on the floor and all unorganized. It looks like they are going out of business. Don't seem to care.  One day not one associate asked me if I need help or even made eye contact. Yesterday Marie, a very pleasant associate helped me. It was obvious she was very busy, but she stopped what she was doing and helped."
2229,She's a very kind lady. She was so gentle with my Maltese. You can tell she really love dogs. I will definitely go back with my little Maltese we both enjoyed it
2230,Great diversity of product but understaffed.  Long waits for help.

2234,Good place to boat or ride
2235,"Never disappointing foods great, service is poor"
2236,"As a travel agent: The eagle river nature center is open all year. It's the place to go to see eagle's bear and more animals which live in Alaska. Don't forget the nature! Wonderful trails take you to views that will hold memories forever.
The staff is educated in survival and will teach you as much as you want to know.They answer questions and take their jobs seriously.
Don't forget to make a donation to save the eagles, purchase the hot cocoa and enjoy a bit of the birds nipping at the honey treats by the windows."
2237,I was very well looked after
2238,Tranquil
2239,Great place for going on a walk. Also great place to bring your dog to run out their energy.
2240,I don't understand the hype. Food was good... but service was lackluster and the smell was overbearing.
2241,They are very polite and very professional employee. I would refer anyone to you.
2242,Love it!!!
2243,Friendly people not very clean on how they handle dirty and clean plates nobody washes their hands food is overpriced for what they are giving you portions are not that big so if you're hungry go somewhere else cuz you're going to pay a lot of money to get very little and if you are a plate of food to share with somebody they will charge you 6 extra dollars for that their chowder is thin and has too much bacon in it and the clams were tough
2244,Today was my second time ..chicken and fries could be crisper. Milkshake was horror or all you could taste was the surup and the price was a little high for what we got.. Hmm need lessons? Staff wS friendly but not helpful and didnt listen to customer.
2245,I get my medicine from there
2246,Great customer services but still hang out place for the homelessü§™

2254,"Panang duck, is all I have to say!"
2255,"Always fun! Great for new skiers, has a great day lodge with food! You can rent all that you need here minus gloves, socks, goggles, and masks, which are available for purchase in the day lodge. Helpful staff and great ski and snowboard instructors! I remember getting lessons and loving it! They also adjust your board or skiis to your boots at the rental shop! Great memories, been going here for years. üòäüëç"
2256,OMG theyre like sam & lees in barrow. Found my 3 combo here in Anch.
2257,Great service and excellent food!
2258,"The fried chicken sandwich was really good! Sweet potato fries were too. It was obvious the ingredients were fresh, and everything meshed together really well. Not much 9f a drink selection but they'll offer water regardless of what else you might pick. The menu was a little difficult to follow initially but we picked up on it fast. Would recommend!"
2259,Love the coffee and flan!
2260,"One of only, 2 games in town."
2261,Great for hangovers
2262,One of my fave places to shop.  Wish they'd let me live there and craft the hours away!!  üòÜ
2263,That dick  was with the long hair was following  me down the dairy isle and his dumb ads got caught
2264,The staff were very helpful and nice.
2265,The atmosphere is great and they have a area for dancing and have plenty of room in general but the burgers had a funny taste so I dont think they were all beef and my drink was weak.
2266,"The prices here aren't great and even though this is my closest grocery store, I usually drive the distance to arrive at somewhere cheaper with a better selection."
2267,"Love the food, staff and very clean."
2268,Great food. Mostly good service.
2269,Great Soup and Sandwich
2270,Friendly people.

2273,You can watch sushi being made. A nice variety of Asian foods. Love the calamari! And the Thai iced tea
2274,Food and beer selection is great.  Service can be a hit or miss depending on how busy it is.  I like the summer time when you can go on roof top.  They do take reservations for large party's and we've always had a good time then.
2275,"Just tried Jewel Lake Pizza & Tea Garden for the first time. Delivery order of Mongolian Beef, Shrimp Lobster Sauce, and a Pepperoni Pizza for the kids. My wife enjoyed the Shrimp, kids said the pizza was OK. I was not happy with the Mongolian Beef, the taste was good, but the dish was 75% or more Onion. I could not believe how little beef there was! I had to hunt for beef on the first bite. Not happy, can't imagine I'll be ordering from here again."
2276,"Good food, alaskan prices. Not cheap for lower 48ers but cheap by alaskan standards."
2277,"Fast and friendly. Takes all types of metals, and they have the ability to unload multiple types of vehicles"
2278,Best cinnamon rolls
2279,Just down the road from the Valdez lake and glacier. Bring your canoes and kayaks.
2280,My family's most visited dining establishment in Fairbanks. Lunch is always reinventing itself based on customer feedback. The pastries are top notch. Breakfast is a must. You can't go wrong with Sarah's Special.
2281,"It looked like a small business so I assumed the pizza would be great.
Nope. Definitely not to my liking at all (I'm from Upstate NY). Couldn't even taste the sauce and it looked like dominos (yuck). I'm just going to stick with Uncle Joe's."
2282,Enjoyed the food and the pint
2283,They have CBD's for the health of it
2284,Fast and easy
2285,I love there grooming department they are always very caring when i bring my dog and my moms dog in to be groomed
2286,This is a must try for great food in Anchorage.
2287,"I love this place!! The bread, the food, the drinks, the service and atmosphere. It's all amazing and I have never had a bad experience out of all of the times I have come to eat here.

They take all of the COVID precautions. You have to wait outside/in your car until your table is ready in order to adhere to social distancing. Everyone is properly wearing masks."
2288,You need to get there right before they open or your looking at an all day visit.
2289,"Delicious food, great coffee, lots of yummy gluten free baked goods and some vegan."
2290,Discount Haircuts
2291,"Used to be a five star deli and did an amazing job of minimizing Covid risk with curbside pickup only, now they are letting people inside with optional masks.  This place has 5 star food and had 5 star safety until recently, hope to patronize your establishment again, but will not be taking the risks management took on.  Maybe it won't be a thing next summer, but until then, hope your employees stay healthy."
2292,Nice hike. Stunning views.
2293,Great customer service
2294,Good food at reasonable prices.
2295,"Unique, lovely backery in Anchorage. Yummy breads, cookies, cakes, sandwiches and salads."

2297,Wow.
2298,One of my favorite places to get steak.
2299,Good soda blonde was in hurry to close

2303,They have nice apartments
2304,The Alaskan Costco is very friendly and had all we needed.
2305,Great burger.
2306,HORRIBLE SERVICE! Arrived at 8 am and had to wait nearly 30 minutes to order and get our food. 30 minutes is along time to wait when you have three hungry boys with you.
2307,"I've been here three times on my vacation. The Halibut Fajitas are awesome and the all you can eat Sunday Buffet had all my favorite. I ate so much, I had to take a walk around the mall across the street. Yummy"

2309,The food and services was awesome. Thanks for helping us to celebrate our 27th wedding anniversary
2310,Love the seafood chimi!
2311,Touristy gift shop in downtown Anchorage.  I bought a novelty tie and pressed some pennies here.  Friendly staff and nice variety for low prices.
2312,Nothing is better than Costco. Great customer service. If something breaks or you need to return something there is no hassle and they will go out of the way to help you.
2313,"Super nice sales people,let you view on your own,no hovering. Answered all our questions very quickly,fast delivery as well"

I‚Äôve tried a few different dishes but frequently get the vegetarian (I‚Äôm not vegetarian, I just love veggies!) Such a cozy little restaurant and they make you feel very welcome. 10/10"
2317,"The most friendliest staff I have ever met at a hotel. I stayed here for a month for work and everyone from the front desk to housekeeping made my stay enjoyable. Newer hotel, very, very clean and nice rooms. Queen bed with sofa sleeper, like a single apt. Larger rooms available and GREAT PRICE! Pics are view from my room"
2318,"Gravel parking lot, great views, friendly and helpful camp host in small lot."
2319,Great burger!

2321,"Clean, friendly, moderately priced. Can't complain"
2322,Fun place with spectacular views.
2323,Service was very good.  I had a burger and the bun just fell apart as I was trying to eat it. Very dry and crumbly.
2324,This is an awesome lodge with pleasant surprises everywhere.  If you make reservations for the two restaurants on the top of the mountain you can ride the Tran free.
2325,Chill vibes
2326,My omelet was severely over priced and the service was sub par. There's no real environment or reason to pay that much for food.
2327,this wack ass place. Music is horrible.
2328,Rude night woman manager.
2329,Don't eat here!! I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning and was vomiting with 2 hours. Extremely understaffed and restaurant is old & dirty
2330,"Friendly people working there. Was a great experience and as always, pizza was delicious!"
2331,Poor parking
2332,Could not find the trailer I was looking for even with the address. Kept bringing me back to the office?!
2333,Typical fast food place.
2334,"Called for a tire and rim. Was told he'd look for one and as promissed, he called back right away. Good price and good service."
2335,"The staff worked really hard to upscale the purchase I wanted to make, and ended up loosing me altogether."
2336,Great drink
2337,"Delivery took about an hour and a half.
Placed an online order, as a Guest, not with a GAPCO account.
An hour after I placed my order, I get a call from the delivery driver asking about my address(they were at my old address). I typed my current address in the online order..
I live 5 minutes away from my old place, it took 20-25 minutes after the call to be finally delivered.
Delivery guy was very nice.
Overall, do not want to experience again."
2338,I love this mall has everything I like

2348,Love the Clearance section. Great back to school sales
2349,"Delicious food, slightly over priced for what it is. Fun eating area outdoors."
2350,"I like this store. They have friendly/helpful staff not to mention a great selection of kitchen appliances. This store reminds me a little of William Sonoma but they also sell stoves, refrigerators, washer and dryers. It is a bit pricey but chances are they will probably have what your looking for if you need an uncommon kitchen item. I'll definately be back."
2351,"What a stunning lake!  Both reflection lake and mirror lake are easier stops off the highway, but this one is only about 9 miles or so down the road, and I think is the prettiest of the 3."
2352,"I went for fishing gear, good selection. And even recommended competitor when did not have specific item..came back to them because of that. Good values and local knowledge."
2353,It's Carl's Jr. I enjoy the western bacon cheeseburger. Fast and friendly service.
2354,Great food and the staff is awesome
2355,Amazing pieces at this place. The detail of the carvings is amazing. Expen6but worth it if you want quality
2356,"Our kitten was neutered at the SPCA. They were efficient and very friendly. My kitten looked great, not too stressed and healed very well. We had a great experience and it was cheaper than other places."
2357,"Not much to look at, but the food was very good and a great beer selection"
2358,The view is very nice though there were close to no animals around despite the guarantee from the tour. It gives you a great view on the tallest mountain in northern America but after a while the landscape gets repetitive so I personally regret taking the 8 hour bus tour around the park.
2359,Great good and internet!
2360,Fav dispensery in Alaska
2361,Enormous sandwich! Glad we shared!
2362,I have been coming to them for a little over 3 years for my window tinting and they are absolutely amazing and has the best pricing in anchorage. I would highly recommend

2368,Well ran and non stressful
2369,Love my sushi
2370,Ok
2371,"Good pizza, a little pricey but better than pizza hut etc. I suggest you call and place your order, this is not a dine in resturaunt and the waiting area and behind the counter are a little dumpy. The folks behind the counter are cordial and friendly however not very professional."
2372,Change for better future
2373,They were closed..
2374,"The atmosphere is old fashioned yet classy, the waitress was funny yet helpful, and the food was fantastic."
2375,"I wish there was a negative rating option or zero stars. THIS IS THE WORST TIRE SHOP IN ALASKA.  Discriminatory towards young women. Every time I left the shop I left in tears And with more problems than what I had came with.  They have the absolute worst customer service and do not care about their customers. They sell people YEARS OLD TIRES when you specifically ask for BRAND NEW ones. Their 'tire insurance' is a joke. I've had multiple incidences with multiple people including different managers and different branches of the store. I had tried to contact the owner  But nobody seems to know how to contact the owner or won't allow me to. They just refer you to another manager at a different branch saying the same exact thing. I rate this tire shop ZERO stars and would tell everyone to save yourself the money & drama to go somewhere, anywhere else."
2376,Best informed staff in the bussiness
2377,Normally I love it there and great menu. My recent visit in December  was tough as not open like usually is for meals such as lunch and dinner..having hard time renewal of liquor licenses as new owners..hopefully gets resolved for the upcoming season
2378,Excellent Thai dishes
2379,Has great food  I enjoy the dry wings

2386,"Highly recommend the Fettuccine!! Handmade noodles, homemade sauce, Chefs speciality."
2387,Good enough
2388,need more retail stores for sure!!!!
2389,Great service and sandwiches. A little noisy but worth the stop
2390,DWAYNE & Melanie were so nice and kind! Had a wonderful meal. Oh my the portions are enough for leftovers! Best chicken fried steak and the steak in general üòã Yummy!!!! A great place I will return. The customer service is absolutely wonderful! Thank you!
2391,Fair gas pricing I should say...
2392,They try and scam me when I buy a 2 dollar item and they charge me 4 and I caught them twice
2393,"The¬†Tanana Valley¬†is a lowland region in central¬†Alaska¬†in the¬†United States, on the north side of the¬†Alaska Range¬†where the¬†Tanana River¬†emerges from the mountains. Traditional inhabitants of the valley are¬†Tanana Athabaskans¬†of¬†Alaskan Athabaskans.

The region experiences great extremes of temperature during the year. During the winter months, the air is prone to¬†stratification¬†due to temperature inversions, leading to thick fogs. During the summer, the surrounding plains are generally boglike, and include much¬†permafrost¬†and many¬†pingos.

The Tanana Valley is the most populated area of Alaska north of the Alaska Range. Its largest city is¬†Fairbanks.

According to James Q. Jacobs, Tanana Valley has the earliest evidence of human occupation in Alaska.

More recently, Tanana Valley sites have been dated to¬†pre-Clovis¬†period, or 13,000‚Äì14,000 cal yr BP.

The¬†Broken Mammoth¬†site, the¬†Swan Point Archaeological Site, and the¬†Mead Archaeological Site¬†are the earliest dated sites in Alaska. They are located along the Tanana River."
2394,"Food was delicious, service was very good and the decor is great."
2395,"Don‚Äôt let the easy accessibility of this place fool you! It‚Äôs an amazing hike to the top, and once you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôll have breathtaking views of Anchorage, the surrounding mountains, and the Turnagain Arm. There was some smoke from the wildfires in the air when we climbed up so it was a bit hazy. But watching the sunset with panoramic views of the surroundings was definitely an unforgettable experience. We even saw a mama moose with two babies on the way back!"
2396,I found out that they cook the chicken in the same oil that they cook the fish in. This is a huge concern for me as I am allergic to seafood but love chicken. They also don't tell you that the gravy used on the mashed potatoes has chicken that is fried (in the oil they cook the fish in) and put into the gravy. So basically my family got to eat there and I had to stop and get a burger on the way home.
2397,"Got take out. Solid pizza.

Place looked super busy, and the wait was quoted at 90 minutes.

Had the blackened salmon pizza, and Buffalo wings. Food was fresh, dough was delicious.

Salad was alright."
2398,Graet staff very friendly and knowledgeable.  Fun place to take the family
2399,Great prices
2400,Amazing experience. Beautiful sights. The crew was great and very helpful. The ranger on board was very informative. The captain did and exceptional job in pointing out sights and navigating the glacial waters. The only complain is that the seats are a little cramped and less people should be seated per table. Luckily you do not have to remain in your seat and are free to explore the boat and take on the sights from the many observation decks.
2401,Very nice and Energy efficient conference center. Love all the natural light. You might even see a moose outside. The beauty of Alaska.
2402,"In my opinion, this is the best beach around! There is a short and easy  trail to the beach. It is so beautiful here!  There is a stream that kids can play in but make sure you keep a close eye on them because it can be swift at times!"
2403,Great times hanging out with friends
2404,"These folks put together an awesome place! Comfortable waiting room for while you wait, with plenty of small puzzles to keep you busy . They've got two escape rooms right now, with a third shortly on the way. We played The Cure, and even though we lost the room, the puzzle was challenging enough to keep us going, and entertaining enough that the whole group is ready to go back and try round 2 on Blitzkreig!"
2405,"Great food, friendly staff, nice selection of beers on tap. A new go-to spot."
2406,They helped my friend get a house in the valley I wish her the best
2407,Changing planes last minute and making familys run across airports is unacceptable
2408,"A place to go when you need to work past lunch, because layouts and general tom foolery."
2409,"Dependable burgers, fries and shakes. Thanks Rich."
2410,Excellent food
2411,Good and reasonably priced breakfast burrito. Not too large.
2412,The service was amazing. The menu selection was huge. The order came to my table super fast. It was delicious. My first choices on the menu were not available. I would go again.
2413,Great
2414,"First floor is to smelly, bad ventilation and carpets are to smelly. And yes they would do your room , change your towels ,empty trash on the eighth day of your stay."
2415,I really enjoyed the location and the restaurant was nice the service was wonderful and so was the food
2416,Beautiful country.
2417,Steak and eggs for 1099 was great!
2418,Love
2419,"Convenient, friendly and they have what I need."
2420,Over all great
2421,"Always delicious, fresh fish the best in town."
2422,Jalapeno thick burger. Amazing.
2423,Good pizza
2424,"Amazed. Got an excellent deal on exactly the vehicle requested, minimal pressure, payment I requested and an outstanding warranty. Would recommend to a human that I like."
2425,I was shocked when I saw all the quality items here! So many new and unused things.  I could have browsed for hours.
2426,"GREAT Food, GREAT prices, serve yourself chips & salsa, beer on tap.     What else do you need!!!"
2427,A step up from the old carousel.
2428,Good food and good service.
2429,Best wash in town.
2430,One stop shop for all your fishing supplies.
2431,consistently friendly folks who try and figure it out for you. They are alreadu my first choice when shopping for supplies.
2432,The customer service is awesome and they have a great selection
2433,"This McDonald's is the best in town. The staff is friendly, accurate and fast. The restaurant is impeccably clean as is the outside. The second floor has always been a fun place to sit and eat. The double drive thru can be frightening, but that's no fault of the restuant, just a heads up."
2434,Great place to go for a hike or a quick drive.
2435,Rude people and will never stay there again.
2436,Good food and service
2437,Very beautiful view. Trail is very nice except that it is uphill all the way. It is hard but worth it!
2438,Amazing beer and outstanding prices.
2439,Cute little park.
2440,"Fast, friendly, hot food, clean environment."
2441,Very good assortment of pretty much everything a grocery store should offer. Good meat selection and very good prices. Store location is not the best...lots of homeless hanging around but store security staff keeps everyone in line... Don't let the riff-raff discourage you from shopping there.
2442,"I went for Breakfast and was impressed, waiter spoke about the fish and chips, so came back to try that. Ordered, served and when I asked for Vinegar to compliment the fish and chip, told we don't carry that, it's been six years since we carried that ????
How do you serve fish and chips without vinegar. Definitely  disappointed."
2443,Another company fighting against our Second Amendment rights .
2444,Need more spices in meat/taco and thinner chips
2445,"Palmer hay Flats is a must for any visitor coming to Alaska. It can be reached off of The Glenn Highway at the first Knik bridge heading towards Palmer called reflection Lake Trail.
Then can also be reached off of Fairview Loop Road called Cottonwood Creek or Palmer hay Flats. Very buggy this time of year. The wildflowers are beautiful & there may be salmon in the creek it is a weekend fishery only I would advise not fishing there at all. Unless you are a very experienced fly fisherman. Very heavy regulations and you have to play the tide game. Have a wonderful visit to Alaska. One of my favorite states but I live here. Be safe out there please."
2446,I don't have money to buy but I like to walk there and talk to my friends house and I love kids I have see slot of kids
2447,I give this a good rating for service and cleanliness. But the pricing is a little steep. Was told they have superior products but have yet to see the proof. Most of the items are just as equal to home depot products. They do specialize in some equipment that can't be found else where.
2448,"Not too crowded, most of the music was...  Meh.....  But all in all was a nice and kept clean experience."
2449,"Pizza was alright, but a bit overpriced. Wasn't terribly impressed with the customer service"
2450,"Very helpful knowledgeable staff. Good building materials
Need a bigger parking lot."
2451,Popcorn was burned and gross
2452,"Great trail, great views"
2453,I always get their combo... excellent!!!
2454,Food is pre prepared frozen then recooked again if it's anything breaded  but great soup
2455,"Really good drinks and food. They have always gotten my steak right. I had a bad experience once, years ago when they first opened, but since I started going back, no problems...still haven't ordered a burger yet...lol!"
2456,I use vibe
2457,Clean
2458,"Excellent Staff, Service and Facility. Been a customer Since 2000"
2459,"Had fun at the Homerun Derby. But, host family passes should be valid. It would be nice and much easier if the park accepted Debit/Credit."
2460,"My chips were one day past the ""expiration"" date, and prices were a little high, but my avocado was great and the shop has excellent selection. The man who helped me was friendly, quick-witted, and willing to let me practice my limited Spanish. Definitely a good resource for harder-to-find ingredients like dried hibiscus and certain spices. Larger bags of certain dried beans, too -- I'd guess 4-5 lbs., but didn't check the label."
2461,Very helpful and nice.
2462,First a smaller tool store they had what I needed
2463,Great food!
2464,Nice view
2465,Great hot coffee. A huge selections of flavors. Quick and friendly service. Only thing I ask is to PLEASE grade around the coffee shack . The potholes are ridiculous! Big bumps and hot coffee don't mix.....
2466,Close to downtown
2467,Grocery shopping
2468,"A gem of Alaska. Anytime if year is a good time to stay. Skiing, hiking, fishing, you name it."
2469,A little costly but good.
2470,"Went in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, atmosphere, and great customer service. I'll definitely come back here."
2471,"Great facilities, everything delivered as promised, and a affordable rate with friendly, helpful service. My event went off without a hitch and made my company look professional. Highly recommended."
2472,"I love it everytime i come in, i get what i want at a good price and its always great!"
2473,"Family owned, quality business, top of the line horse tack, western boots and clothing."
2474,"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance. Best dining in Anchorage"
2475,Great selection of outdoor gear. Friendly and knowledgeable employees
2476,"Wonderful coffee, very good bagel, but expensive breakfast sandwich.  Will be back."
2477,A place to eat
2478,"Had most items I was shopping for, including disinfecting wipes."
2479,Worth the trip to the end of the spit! Just hope there isn't an earthquake during your stay.
2480,"Its ok, on the water but it's more like a parking lot on the water."
2481,My favorite place to eat in Anchorage
2482,The food here has always been good and I love coming here to get a burrito some beans and rice and it's always delicious
2483,The service was great (even for pickup)! We had D12 and everything was beyond delicious. I got this for my mom for a late night snack and even ate half it. This place is great and we will definitely be regulars when were in town.
2484,This store has everything game wise
2485,They have a box of mine for the past 7 days. Unorganized outfit cant even drop my box off
2486,"Good food, no liquor, but decent Mexican draft beer selection"
2487,"Updated 2020-

2018- Starbucks is life. I know I‚Äôm dramatic but I need caffeine to live and Starbucks gives me that fuel every single day yes every single day. I have my hot drink that does not change and make cool drink when it‚Äôs hot out that does not change. I‚Äôve been a gold member for five years. You got to earn them re-wards"
2488,"Came here by my little ol self and made the mistake (can we even call it that though) of ordering a small pizza AND cheesy bread sticks. Needless to say, the bread sticks arrived and I knew I was in trouble. They were huge! Hot, cheesy, delicious goodness. I got through about 2 bread sticks before the pizza arrived and I realized I was in trouble. But how could I refuse the colorful pizza beckoning to me?
I only got one slice down but man, even after being sooooo full I was tempted to try and eat another slice. The margherita pizza was crispy on the bottom, the crust was fluffy, and cheese and toppings were flavorful and delicious. The fresh basil really balanced all the cheese I was shoveling into my mouth.
I've had several friends and co workers recommend Mooses Tooth and now I understand why. Do yourself a favor and at least stop for pizza. Theres apparently always a wait but it goes by fast and is 100% worth it."
2489,Only place around with bubblegum ice cream as far as I know....
2490,So down on my luck...That's normal for me. Night before I got a screw in my tire. I didn't realize it till almost 5pm next day. They were so kind and considerate. I came in last minute before they closed. I'm very grateful for their service. I recommend this place %100.
2491,Good family fun
2492,"I was told that this is a really expensive place so I was avoiding it and shopping around for fittings and such.  When I actually went their I realized that not only do they have a great selection of fittings (couplers, reducers etc) but they're actually priced lower than home depot or lowes or other hardware places. However, their major components do seem to be more expensive (such as say a pressure reduction valve) compared to a company like Hasco for instance."
2493,Says the ski slopes are open on their website and they aren't. Super friendly people though.
2494,Over priced.
2495,Great start to do your shopping at very competitive prices like the bakery love the deli.
2496,"Long drive, be careful, but enjoyable.  Be aware,  your only one in pools/ hot tubs and they get changed weekly.  I think Monday/ Tuesday?  Anyway,  please shower before entering any water.  It helps."
2497,"Comics, cards, figures, and everything in between. This is the place for nerds."
2498,Only pet store I go to. They have so many things for your pet.
2499,Nice park
2500,I've eaten here 5 times now and have no complaints.  The sushi is always on par with what I expect - the restaurant is always clean and the staff are always professional
2501,"Tastes burnt, not local :("
2502,Reasonable prices beautiful store. The only rude person I have encountered is the guy with his plugs in the sushivarea definitely needs a class in customer service. Comes across rude
2503,One of the cleaner theatres in ANC. But lately their have folks at this theatre that come in making alot of noise while the movie is going on which is a bit annoying. If their staff polices this up more it will make this theatre the best one in ANC. I like their Tues. deals. Hopefully they have more deals to come and lower their membership price to join them. Then they will get a five star from me indeed.
2504,"My daughter and I were here for her birthday dinner. As a chef, I highly recommend it."
2505,Love it great for gifts
2506,"Has great selection. If taking band orchestra, or keyboarding at Mirror Lake, they have the books for you! They sell keyboards, grand pianos, and guitars!"
2507,"Meh. I've been here several times... the decor, menu items, and prices are... aspirational.

Latest order - Pork Belly Lettuce & Tomato, Thai Chicken Curry, Cheese Pizza.

PBLT didn't have enough of the PB and way too much of the sweet ""tomato jam"". It was a sweet sandwich with minimal savory from the pork belly to balance it.
Curry - my nephew didn't eat much of hit.
Cheese pizza - fairly good. We all liked it.

Regular burgers here are very good. I'd stick with that, or have the PBLT with none of the ""jam""."
2508,Good food.
2509,Oh my goodness it has been years since I have had bullwinkles pizza and family fun I introduced my kids to the pizza and nothing has changed it's still yummy
2510,"They dont have as many snack options as they used to,ki d of disappointing"
2511,Nice
2512,Nice atmosphere.  Friendly staff and the food is good.
2513,"Food is great,  service is sloooow."
2514,If u didn't drive away with a different car you are still under pressure of I don't know what I want!!!
2515,"For many years I've had the best service, atmosphere and food at this wonderful restaurant! Two thumbs WAY up."
2516,"We went for lunch ordered halibut sandwich which was really great, husband ordered spaghetti which was really awful, the noodles were mushy and it was tasteless, we did not get the side salads we ordered till after the meal and sent them back since they cost extra we also ordered a vanilla shake which was just flavored milk with whipped cream. The service was awful, we got the wrong drinks and then no refills till it was time for the check. The waitress tried to take our credit card without showing us the bill. We will not be back. It's a shame it's been around a long time maybe they do better with breakfast."
2517,"TLDR: Not sure if it was worth the cost, but the scenes were nice. Staff was nice but maybe understaffed.

This is the first time I have been here in about 10 years. The staff was really great and they were quick to get answers about nuts in different dishes as we have nut allergies in our family. It would be helpful if the signage had allergens listed. We came in at 1pm and it was very busy and there was a few mins where they did not have plates for the buffet and a few items were not refilled. They did get everything back up but it seemed they may have been understaffed for how many people were there. Also, the bathroom was not as clean as I would have expected.  It was fun to see the river and the grounds are very pretty. I'd recommend once. Not sure if we will return."
2518,Wonderful new grocery store with wide isles. I love the bright and open spaces with a large selection.
2519,Great place to stay
2520,Very comfortable and relaxing
2521,Fast and convenient shopping great deli and bakery. Plus many of today's top products for house hold needs.
2522,I really don't even want to give it a star.  Sign out front steaks and seafood.  Not even!  So we went w Italian.  Spaghetti and lasagna and it was subpar.  Restaurant pricey for whT you get!
2523,"I only go here to go to Planet Fitness but it seems to be a decent place. the only problem i have with them is that the people that are in the mall seem to be a little sketchy, I realize that this isn't their fault but it does take something away from the experience."
2524,Really like the location
2525,"Great indian food, nice atmosphere"
2526,"Sushi was good but the service wasn't.   The older lady, waitress was rude. If I eat from here again it will be aushi bar or takeout."
2527,"(Translated by Google) Regular

(Original)
Regular"
2528,Good food. It was maybe a little bland. I‚Äôd go again though. I loved the hot tea with a touch of honey.
2529,Favorite diner and Alaska. Great local spot with something for everyone.
2530,They always do a good job with our hair.
2531,A great place to go wonderful selection of all types of items
2532,"Kind, professional staff. Thank you."
2533,Had a great experience.
2534,Worth the beautiful 7 hour ride
2535,"Speedy , in and out"
2536,Like their wing combo good service
2537,"(Translated by Google) Initially we were attracted by the simple side of the establishment.
When ordering, the person was unable to tell us what was in the ""black and blue burger"".
Burger prices average $ 14, French fries are not included.
I priced the ""crab cake burger"".
There is not much to eat and you do not even taste the crab, it's too fried and seasoned.
The chips are not top and are ultra salty.
By asking for the WiFi code we were told that it is only for cash management.
Looking at the receipt, we realized that the box rounded the total ticket above (see photo).
Already that burgers are expensive without fries, I find it amazing that the total is rounded up, not even closer.
It's really a place I do not recommend.
Cross the street and for a little more money you will have a much higher quality.

(Original)
Au d√©part nous √©tions attir√©s par le c√¥t√© simple de l'√©tablissement.
Lors de la commande, la personne √©tait incapable de nous dire ce qu'il y avait dans le ""black and blue burger"".
Les prix des burgers sont en moyenne √† $14, les frites ne sont pas comprises.
J'ai prix le ""crab cake burger"".
Il n'y a pas grand chose √† manger et on ne sent m√™me pas le go√ªt du crabe, c'est trop frit et trop assaisonn√©.
Les frites ne sont pas top et sont ultra sal√©es.
En demandant le code du WiFi on nous a r√©pondu que c'est uniquement pour la gestion de la caisse.
En regardant le ticket de caisse, nous nous sommes rendu compte que la caisse arrondi le total du ticket au dessus (voir photo).
D√©j√† que les burgers sont chers sans frites, je trouve √ßa hallucinant que le total soit arrondi au dessus, m√™me pas au plus proche.
Cest vraiment un endroit que je d√©conseille.
Traversez la rue et pour un peu plus cher vous aurez une qualit√© bien sup√©rieure."
2538,Really enjoy buying Fresh Local Tomatoes and English Cucumbers.. Also Enjoy Wintering the Wifes Martha Washington and Thuja Emerald Green Tree
2539,I sure appreciate  this business.
2540,"Jill was very friendly, fast and efficient!"
2541,"Went twice in a month just because I like the place so much. I usually get the fish sandwich, but surprising they make a great burger as well! It's hidden in a little menu off to the side, so easy to miss. Friendly, very attentive staff. Cosy environment. Be sure to eat on the outer deck if the weather is nice."
2542,Always consistent
2543,Beautiful scenery
2544,Great coffee and great breakfast. Have to pay for parking tho
2545,We had a wonderful time. Santa and his reindeer. Christmas tree lighting. It was cold and packed but everyone was kind. The Salvation Army had free cookies and cocoa.
2546,Wheres the meat
2547,Local charm good food excellent service
2548,If you want the local gossip it's great the food prices who are they kidding..
2549,Good to throw weddings n all kids of functions they have tables kitchen supplies
2550,"Went for a few odds and ends, found them all!!"
2551,Great place to eat.  The food was really good. It was my first time there. The waitress took time to explain the menu to me. I had the pad thai because it was recommended. I was not disappointed. Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. I will be back!
2552,"Upgraded equipment, and normally full. Great place."
2553,"The food is great, especially the braided breadsticks!!"
2554,Omg the parking the lines and the jacked construction. I had an anxiety attack just trying to park and get out no no no go to tikatnu or somewhere else
2555,The best quickest service!! LOVE . There used to be more broth and meat than Noddles tho :(
2556,Great place to buy vape products.
2557,"The books are well-organized and it's easy to find the titles I'm searching for. They have good security. The atmosphere is cozy. The store is clean, even their restrooms are nicer than in most public places. Check out is quick. Employees are helpful. They're easy to find, and they have good parking."
2558,Feel like I'm watched every move.its a  little nurve racking sometimes.
2559,Food and staff are great but the chips always suck usually stale end or over-salted or dark and chard everything else is great though.
2560,Nice Salad Bar and Sandwiches.
2561,"Best place in town, Rob and crew are awesome! Cheryl and JoJo are even better."
2562,This place takes forever in the drive through and my kids have gotten since every time we let them go inside and play
2563,I do all my shopping here everything is nice quality good food bio my dog food there it's a great price especially for here and Alaska
2564,Beautiful place to play golf & Excellent food
2565,"I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, i feel like the window folks AT the PO always at least try their best to help me, no matter what I need. On the OTHER hand, mail delivery is spotty AT BEST, and i have failed to receive several important packages and correspondence because of this. Yesterday, an item i was expecting on Jan. 19th went out for delivery at 6am. I work from home, and my landlord almost never leaves her house. Starting at 530, i actually WATCHED for the postman to bring my package. At 815 i gave up. Then I received a notification that he had ATTEMPTED to deliver at 730pm but was unable to ""gain access"". WHAT?!?

We keep our cars in the garage, so nothing blocks the driveway. There are obvious and accessible steps leading right to my front door. AND we literally have the biggest mailbox i have ever seen, big house number right across it, it is in plain view on the UNOBSTRUCTED street RIGHT THERE.

So, either he couldn't locate the correct address and was trying to deliver somewhere else (not the first time), or he was LYING because he wanted to go home and had to document reasons for undelivered mail. Because he for SURE did not come to MY house.

If he had, he definitely would have mentioned the moat.

Kidding. And i am going with reason two.

Because his job is literally to KNOW WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, so if he can't do that, he should probably find another calling."
2566,Accused me of stealing
2567,First timer wow will be back maybe twice a week. There were things i like from chinese food that they didnt serve but they are not express items so no prob. One word of advice we have all been to marginal buffet style. Look for empty bowl and wait in my case 30 seconds bowl was full eating 30 seconds later you rock kung pow chicken. Spicey fresh yum
2568,Great vet and great staff!
2569,Awesome place
2570,Not my scene.
2571,Big stores.  If you need it They probably have it.
2572,Never liked this place for both personal & newly recent reasons.
2573,Great ghost chilli martini and soup of the day starts every Friday evening.
2574,Best milkshake in town!!!!!
2575,It's always been a good store.
2576,"Honestly, its the only store on the peninsula thats left for stuff at competitive pricing when you shop amazon. They'll have some pretty good deals, and most of what you need. Service has always been good, even though they are one of the few places that are open."
2577,"Good pizza, open late, lots of beer on tap."
2578,"I went to the store on Christmas Eve because my phone screen had broken. I understand that they wanted to get out of there etc however the lady that helped me was very obviously in too much of a rush. No, I didn't go right when they were going to close or even within an hour before. All she had to do was turn a new phone on for me. She actually said ""can you just do the Google part yourself when you leave? I don't feel like messing with it"". Well, to make sure that my contacts etc went thru and that everything worked right, you kind of have to do it when you buy the phone if you use Google/gmail, which I do. I know she was probably tired from christmas shopping etc but at the same time, I could have gone elsewhere to buy a phone. I could have gone and just gotten one of those ones from Wal-Mart. I chose to go thru this company, I waited at least 30 mins, I was also in a hurry and had tons of things to do yet the difference is, I wasn't rushing her or making her feel as tho she were bothering me. Bad move in a small store, in Wasilla, Alaska. Just so not cool! Good company, good prices on many things but this time I had very lame customer service."
2579,Quick service but fries were old
2580,Good upkeep and options
2581,"This was the few restaurants where they use to make  their own burgers, went there today  what terrible surprise, the hamburger tasted like precooked, dry and tasteless.
Hope they bring back their in house made burgers."
2582,The cook is awesome! Staff is always nice! Food is always on point!
2583,Best cakes in town!!
2584,A typical walmart find everything u need under one roof
2585,Love the people that work here. What a great team
2586,"I'm so glad I tried this place today! My food was amazing. Best money spent.  If you're hungry for a burger, please go here."
2587,In the diamond center is gamestop I went in and the 1st thing that someone came up to me and asked me if I needed help And that's reason why I'd like to find my games their customer service is good they're nice and courteous
2588,Loved that place. Very good for fishing
2589,"Great food, service and drinks"
2590,"I needed coolant for my Polaris ATV and some Stihl equipment.¬†I went to purchase a $720 backpack fogger (SR 450), $650 backpack blower (BR 800 C-E) and a $650 FS240 trimmer for my business.¬†I spent about 5 minutes waiting for somebody in sales to come help, which they didn't.¬†The Stihl ""desk"" was unoccupied, but there were numerous sales folks walking around waxing motorcycles or playing on their phones. I then went and pulled down the FS 240, put the harness on, adjusted it, made more adjustments, attached the trimmer, and walked around to see how the weight was distributed and how comfortable it was.¬†In hindsight, I probably should have swung it around the motorcycles that may have got their attention.¬†At this point, I started to really notice how little they cared about the Stihl brand within their store as 2 other sets of people had come and gone by the time I had danced around with the trimmer and accessories.¬†I had spent almost 20 minutes in the store, looking at the equipment that I wanted to purchase (They didn't have a backpack fogger).¬†I then grabbed the coolant and went to the parts counter and paid.¬† During the transaction, I was asked ""Did you find everything you needed?"" I replied that I had spent far too much time waiting for somebody to assist me, so I was going to go else ware.¬†The counter guy offered to see if he could find somebody, to which I declined.¬†I have been disappointed by the Outpost, and have used the dealership in Delta as the only place I will purchase Polaris vehicles from in Interior Alaska. I only went to the Outpost because I needed coolant AND Stihl equipment.¬†They had both.¬† I was told by the parts guy that the Stihl¬†""salesman"" actually works at Fort Knox Gold mine, this was a ""part time"" job for him when he wanted to come in, and that he didn't know much about the equipment anyway.
The Outpost touts themselves as the farthest north blankity-blank dealership in America.¬†But, that is the only thing they have going for them.¬†I have never been impressed with their customer service or their service department.¬†(I spent almost $350 for them to tell me my fuel pump was bad, diagnosis only, no repair). I have purchased Stihl and Honda small engine equipment (Chainsaw and Generator), but that was because I was new in town and was willing to accept sub-par customer service as the norm.¬†But, after being here in Fairbanks for 10 years, I've learned that sometimes the little shops are the ones that shine, the glitzy dealership on the highway is based solely on their exclusivity of some brands.¬†The equipment I need to pay the bill is available elsewhere, and most all manufactures offer ""Nationwide pricing"" so, going someplace with big windows and shiny motorcycles isn't going to save you any money. Go to the little guys.¬†As far as weekend toys, I have NEVER been disappointed by going to Delta (I live in North Pole, so it doesn't seem THAT far to save a thousand or so dollars vs. these guys).

I know this was long, but after 10 years of not having anything positive to say about the Outpost, I feel I have the clout to post a long winded and factual track record experience with the Outpost. I fully expect to see a reply from their ""customer service rep"" stating ""We are sorry for bla-bla-bla, we pride ourselves in bla-bla-bla"". Well Outpost, after 10 years of sub-par customer service, I can fully feel justified in saying, Fairbanks is known for its sub-par customer service, but you get first place for poor customer service.¬†(We are sort of an island here in Fairbanks, Sub-par seems standard in Fairbanks...)¬†The Outpost only has their exclusive brands that carry the weight and ""force"" that brand of customer to go there.¬† I'll visit for fluids, order my hard-parts from online Polaris dealers, purchase my Honda small engine from either the Wood Way (I have some opinions about them), Sportsman's Warehouse (Generators and their Military discounts!) or Craig Taylor for Honda small engine and Stihl equipment."

2619,Good hotel and food restaurant. Breakfast available but not included in room rate.
2620,Its mcdonalds

2635,I went with my beautiful friend and our kiddos to have lunch. It was busy inside but we had good service and great meals. Portions were enough to bring and eat more at home.
2636,"I'm so glad that there is a place like this around here. How come this wasn't here when I was a kid? Come here quite often with my son and he seems to have a blast every time.  Its very clean, even on busy days."
2637,Very good
2638,"A trip to Pel'meni is a MUST for anyone visiting Juneau.  Fun laid back environment and the single item menu (with carnivore or vegetarian option) is all you'd ever need and exactly what you want, especially at 1AM!"
2639,Beautiful! Love the walking trails!
2640,Super friendly. Great groomer and amazing price!
2641,Play place was pretty dirty but what fast food  play place isn't?  The burgers were cold.  The service in the evening time was very poor and the restroom was out of toilet paper.  Good job management.  Note my sarcasm...  The orange Julius was tasty as heck though..
2642,"Went to get a hair cut at ulta for the first time. My friend told me that she loved going their so I set up an appointment online for a cut and style with Monah. When I got there the lady at the register said she was running behind and would page me when she was ready. I heard my name called so I went to the front desk. But I think the lady was on her way out so she just told me to have a set in a chair. Their was hair still all over the floor from the last person but she still had me sit there. Mohan washed my hair and started the hair cut. She didn't talk much and disnt ask if the cut in the back was to short. ""It was"" she straightened my hair to finnishe the cut. She didnt really style it at all. When I got to the register to pay she said it would be 66. But online it said 55. And their was a sign that said 1st time customers get 20% off there hair cut. But she said straightening my hair cost extra. But no one told me that. She never said anything. So she called a manager up. But the hair salon manger left for the day. So this lady had no idea what was going on. Monah took off the 11 is cost to straighten my hair and told me that someone should have told me before the hair cut that it was extra. She didnt give me 20% off and acted like she did me a favor by taking off the 11 dollars. It was just a bad experience. I will not go back there."
2643,Drinks made well. Friendly staff. Not overpriced. Adine is a great employee and my favorite!
2644,It's a Little Caesars. The staff is good.
2645,It's the staff that gets the 3 stars.
2646,I had a great stay at the Creekwood durring my occupancy there...OR SO I THOUGHT!!!

2648,Great place to play Bingo
2649,Nice people
2650,I love this place!!  The staff is very friendly and atentitive to service.   I like to sit at the sushi bar and watch the masters at work and to have a good conversation. Ronnie and the other chefs are very helpful with suggestion if you need help or want to try somethings new!! High recommendation
2651,Funny place
2652,"Paul, the technition, was absolutely fantastic!!!! Wat a pro and very pleasant. I recommend him highly!"

2657,Great food great staff..
2658,Great staff.
2659,"2 stars for inconsistency. They have some really great wing sauce flavors but I'm almost never happy with how it turns out. The first few times I went the sauce was thick and ""saucy."" But the last few times I've been highly dissatisfied, it's like they are watering the sauce down with a whole bunch of oil or something. It's honestly quite gross. The wings come out in a puddle of oil or grease and there isn't much of any actual sauce. I keep going back because at one point the sauce was good. Especially the Lemongrass. It is WAY better than it sounds and is a life changing wing sauce.. When they do it right. Also very expensive for wings. And we have gone during published business hours but they weren't open."
2660,"Great staff, great place"
2661,"Buffet lunch had a food selection and the food was good, however service was slow and not very attentive."
2662,"""Love the food, price, and interior of the restaurant."""
2663,Okay.
2664,Store run by people who know animals.  Not just flashy retail useless stuff
2665,"So close to the water you could taste it. Picknick tables, fire rings, shower, and good potable free water. Can't beat the view. Clean well kept area. We were able to leave our setup all day without any issues. My only wish was there were no windbreaks. We will camp there again."
2666,Nice and friendly service.
2667,Best Ribeye you will find in all of the USA!
2668,"Great food, even better service!"
2669,I love shopping for gently used kids clothes and toys here.  The items are usually well organized and the store is kept clean.  There is a good variety of items and they have a system to rotate the stock so you don't keep seeing the same rejects.
2670,"Come on, it's Autozone."
2671,Huge Walmart. Has everything you could imagine. Staff is super friendly and very resourceful.
2672,Kind of expensive for what you get.
2673,Very helpful employees on how to care for a plant. I really like this place and the atmosphere.
2674,"I did not know of the winter trails until this year. It is beautiful on sunny days if you're walking, biking, skiing, mushing, or snowmaching enjoy the scenery."
2675,Was mostly there for the play area. It's pretty clean and the kids love. Ordered some kids meals and had chicken strips for myself. It was nice and crispy. Ordered some ice creams later on and I will definitely come again for the ice cream. Cheap and amazing! Nice heaping portions too.
2676,Pretty good clothes but khols is better
2677,"Great service, got me in right away."

2684,Good food but to Smokey when it's busy
2685,"Very friendly, knowledgeable and quick."
2686,"Fast, friendly service!"
2687,Staff is amazing and so nice.
2688,Great selection of books! Even the free table has great finds!
2689,"The staff are always very nice, dining area is clean, and the music is relaxing. They also have a bar for sushi and they usually play sports games on the TV's in there. They usually remember what regulars order, they get the food out fast, and since their latest change in management it's been pretty good quality. A little more expensive than other restaurants, but the atmosphere and food quality is better."
2690,Always nice and always helpful associates
2691,"Clean rooms. Quiet. Reasonably priced for winter. Front desk was very pleasant and helpful. After checking out, we realized we left something behind and returned to go get it. Front desk was gracious to let us back in to retrieve our items."
2692,June 2018 Not impressed for the price.
2693,"Good everything..great beer list, many micro brews."
2694,"Beautiful, quiet, peaceful. 20 minute stop is all it takes. Very nice."
2695,Good family restaurant. Lots of food for around  $13.
2696,Lions an tigers an bears Oh my! Don't forget the horseflies! It's the end of the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail and the planet walk that starts downtown. There is a giant cell tower disguised as a pine tree. History is sprawled about this area as a missle base.
2697,"Best breakfast joint in downtown Anchorage, worth the fourty minute wait if you're in a group, or stop by the bar if solo for faster seating"
2698,Did you know that smell is responsible for 95% of the taste of food! Fall's pumpkin spiced latte is one of my favorite drinks.
2699,Awesome food
2700,Great beer and great food with a friendly waiting staff is a recipe for repeat visits.... and this place has it all!
2701,"This is a good place to hang with family and friends. I went here with a bunch of brothers and sisters from my church and the pizza took about 45 minutes but it was worth it and it gave us some time to talk and fellow ship for a while. Service could be faster but other than that great food, service and atmosphere I would recommend to any one"
2702,"Loved this place. The ladies doing my nails did a wonderful job. By far the most relaxing pedicure I have had. No nail touch ups needed for the acrylics I got were perfectly shaped. I denoted one star due to how long I had to wait, but over all a great salon."
2703,Great staff! They helped me find everything I needed.
2704,The build your own pasta is always my go-to!
2705,"Average department store. I don't care for how Kohl's marks things up and then puts them on ""sale"" though"
2706,"I love taco Bell and pretty much everything they have, they're fast and easy"
2707,Great food
2708,Unique food items from european russian countries
2709,Good
2710,"Most of the employees here are super helpful. Their knowledge and experience are on point. My husband bought my DSLR camera here and they helped him find the one I wanted for my birthday. I like to support this local business in Fairbanks, and have since gone back and bought more supplies and prints of my Alaskan adventures. One employee there likes to tell you about how amazing he is at photography and will talk at length about the equipment he likes the best for what he does. This is after I tell him I don't need his help.  So you may get a guy who talks about himself when you rather shop but there are emloyees like him everywhere. Overall a great hometown camera store."
2711,Great place even just to visit. They have fresh food and local crafts.
2712,Secure place to store your stuff with professional and friendly staff
2713,"The drive to Chitina (""Chit-na"")...if you pronounce it ""Chi-tina"", folks will peg you as a ""Cheechako"" or tourist right off the bat, is fantastic. It will take you through the Copper River Basin--Alaska's version of Arizona's Grand Canyon. Chitina is well-worth the side trip!"
2714,"Utterly beautiful hotel! Several shops to choose from for shopping.  Room was a very nice size, and very clean. Staff was helpful and very courteous."
2715,Great shop with helpful staff. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for.
2716,Good store
2717,"Very clean, helpful staff, and very fast experience. Would definitely come back if I didn't move state. Would absolutely recommend the King wash. The lights are so fun."
2718,Friendly staff
2719,"The people were nice, the food was alright. I had a chimichanga, I felt like there was not much cheese and it was kinda small."
2720,"I'm not sure what is going on here, but the service tonight was terrible.  I never order sushi at Benihana's because there are better places to get good-quality sushi.  But I ordered sashimi, and it was the worst!!!  The yellowtail looked like it had been frozen for months.  The salmon and tuna were utterly tasteless.  Even the chicken-fried rice I usually order was ""off"" -- dry and crunchy.  I may never go back to Benihana's."
2721,Good food.
2722,"Fun! Awesome facilities, GREAT sounds and warm whilst watching the ice hockey. Food looked great, will try it next time!"
2723,Great daily specials!
2724,Loved Santa hereüòç
2725,Good for diner fare.
2726,Awesome place! Very clean establishment and good people
2727,Great selection.  Go with a friend to ward off the local inebriates.
2728,fast service
2729,I just go for the crunchy tacos
2730,Can't say enough about this park.
2731,"I had a wonderful experience buying my sorento here. All of the staff was very polite and they were helpful but not pushy. I was helped originally by Wes, who was great and was wonderful and patient with my energetic four year old boy who I had with me.
Wes even checked in twice after I had bought and taken the car home, just to make sure I was still happy with my choice and that the car was working out well for me."
2732,"Very intelligent employees, they could answer all my questions and make suggestions. Extremely happy and will always come back"
2733,Ian freakng rocks.
2734,"Full honesty; I had communication troubles with the studio in the beginning. I had worked with artists in other mediums before and mistakenly thought that is how the tattoo process would go. However, I have learned and I'd say everything is copacetic.

Shop is clean, organized, artists know what they can and can't do. Will, was straight up, took breaks and ended the session when needed. He was more than happy to explain anything and frankly does kickass work. I have him a rough concept and he produced something far better than I could have ever come up with. I picked up on some inspirations he had incorporated and I'd say was a great bonding moment. He still stabbed me, but whatever.

No pictures to show, I will leave that for Will. I am pleased and would return."
2735,"I never write bad reviews but  I had agreed on a certain price that was already over priced , then I show up to my appointment and the woman tries charging me more.  Not only that she left bleach on a test piece of hair.  The hairstylist name was Amber.  Its bad business did not appreciate how I was treated.   Do not recommend this place."
2736,It's a clean well run McDonald's
2737,We were served by a pick haired girl who's hair was flying everywhere. I thought it might be nice to see a hair net between her hair and my food. Other then that its fast food as expected.
2738,Relaxing
2739,Amazing beauty of this place. Visited this place so many times during my Anchorage trips and loved it every time! Can't control myself from clicking. :)
2740,Some awesome food. Great time.
2741,good food. service is bad on occasion.
2742,It gets a four because they had a 10% military discount. What whaaaaat!!
2743,Customer service is great. Chicken wings  and custom margaritas are fantastic
2744,"Pizza is outstanding, staff is great, plan to wait. The wait is worth it."
2745,"Saw a great show, no problems getting in and finding a seat."
2746,Hot and fast
2747,So Nice!! Feel good after that.
2748,Favorite place to walk the dog.
2749,Good for bulk purchases.
2750,"Food was decent, service was fast and polite, the place wasn't packed even in peak lunch hours."
2751,"I was expecting more ‚Äúfarmers market‚Äù Alaska grown food and local made products, but it was more like a tourist trap of souvenirs and repackaged Costco produce.  The majority of souvenirs I saw were all made in China, not Alaska either.

The kettle corn and food stalls were good, buts that‚Äôs about it."
2752,"Def a great stop to learn about everything going on in Fairbanks.  Lots to see inside. Plus a movie about Fairbanks plays ever 30 mins.  Nice restrooms and common area to just warm up if it‚Äôs freezing outside.  The staff is amazing.  SHERRI in there knows her stuff. She helped us a lot to learn about the lights and checking the stats on them. She‚Äôs super knowledgeable of the area. Ask for her if you go, super friendly."
2753,Perfect lunch spot.  Try the picante burrito if you like spicy.  Shrimp burrito is also packed with shrimp.
2754,City people destroying Alaska one quad at a time. Total disrespect.
2755,Best to be on Sunday
2756,"I would probably be a lot skinnier and much richer had I never discovered this gem. This is my go-to for evening treats. Whats not to love about a place like this with so much history. Its been around for 60 years.  The service is fast, and friendly."
2757,They have a good deals on carry out. The pizza is also much better than Little Caesars.
2758,Americanized Mexican food. Good generous portions. Very popular
2759,"The best soups in town.  Spicy Pho will help get rid of your cold and keep that hunger away for a very long time.  I highly suggest that you call in your order, because walk-ins for take-out take a long time.  Parking is shared, so you'll spend more time finding a parking spot than to get a seat for dinner.

2760,Great family park.. Has a nice play ground for all ages and a big field to run or fly kites in.. A small duck pond and an ice skating track in the winter
2761,By far the best and most relaxing pedicure I've ever had. The ambiance and calmness of the facility as well as the amazing staff definitely makes this place stand out. I'll be returning!
2762,It's a lot smaller than you would think.
2763,Really yummy and Iove Thai food!
2764,Great coffee most of the time and theyre open 24/7
2765,Fresh toast sticks were disgusting
2766,place is going down hill
2767,Great service for your shipping needs.
2768,Excellent Customer Care Here!!  Best Fairbanks Mechanic.
2769,Good food.
2770,It was good. The BBQ sampler is great.
2771,Owner asked us to leave for not wearing a mask. No problem.  Lots of other choices around.
2772,"Great prices, friendly staff. Only downside is limited selections."
2773,"It's pretty, and sometimes full of bears and spawning salmon. The trails are nice, but not always well marked or maintained. Make sure you go with an actual guide or check maps before setting off on a hike. Also, carry bear spray."
2774,"Does what it promised, although the day we selected was a very windy rainy day so a lot of things weren't visible. Booking can be done on the spot, actually recommended by them as the access to Whittier is depended on the one way access tunnel, so there is no guarantee you can make it on time. The captain was friendly and answered all of our questions about the glaciers and such. The meal that's was served on board is included in the cruise price. fish served on board was fresh and yummy, although you are allowed to take your own food."
2775,great breakfast
2776,"View is breathtaking, but there is no good access from the bridge itself. There is parking on left when driving towards Denali national Park. It has a small path which gives good view of the bridge."
2777,Love these guys...best in town!
2778,Good food
2779,Great deals lots of variety  will be back for sure.
2780,Great customer service and knowledgeable staff. Only place I will buy my phone and internet technology.
2781,Friendly people.
2782,Everything about this place slaps. this is some of the best quality desserts in town with an incredibly reasonable price. The vibe is just right. Don't contemplate it just go. A sweet tooth haven and a diverse menu.
2783,Nothing bad to say about this place
2784,Good price
2785,"Good food, good staff. PB&J is my favorite smoothie."
2786,Great prices and incentives
2787,Great selection of Mexican and Italian foods.  A little Pricey but has great service.  I really like the different soups that they have with dinner different each time I go.
2788,Great cheese steak sandwiches
2789,Great service and amazing cook! We sat at Bradow's table and he killed it with the food and jokes!
2790,Fast pizza was hard to split apart for canadian bacon didnt bring condiment that were reqursted
2791,Alaska's Vegas
2792,If you want to get in and out quickly this is the place to go. Prices are probably a little more than Fred Meyers but a little cheaper than IGA Foodland.
2793,"Always a fun place, and the food is good. Servers are pleasant and very good at what they do!"
2794,No complaints about this mcdonalds. They get the orders right every time and the people are friendly. Room for improvement however: the sweet tea is VERY inconsistent. Sometimes not sweet at all and other times too sweet. Work on that and I'll be happier.
2795,"Great place to play all day. Kid friendly, great staff. You can have pizza, dots, or chicken strips and more. Reasonably priced. Inky drawback is high smell of chlorine."
2796,"Appetizer (gyoza) was really not good at all. I've had gyoza probably 15 different places and this was almost inedible, it tasted very fake.

The sushi was pretty good, not the best I've had in Fairbanks but the portions were large. We might give this one another shot sometime but underwhelmed overall."
2797,Good food sometimes out of what u really want but still good
2798,Awesome
2799,Awesome all the way around
2800,"What a cool restaurant!  Amazing food, as well. So happy they were able to easily accommodate our large group and were such lovely people to dine with. We'll definitely be back, probably more for a quieter, more romantic meal."
2801,"My friend and I stayed here for easy access to the local anime/manga/video game convention, and the front desk was incredibly kind any time we interacted with them (And bless their hearts for not batting an eyelash when we wandered into the lobby in cosplay). Great pool, nice little snack shop and business center, and cool view of downtown Anchorage and the inlet."
2802,Efficient.
2803,"Fix this place up. There are only a few places in Kodiak to stay....rooms smell BAD. I think the worst thing to see was the awesome bear on the wall but it has about 3 inches of dust on it, SAD. Staff were awesome, thanks they are why I didn't give one star."
2804,The employees were exceptionally friendly. The lines were not long and overall store was clean well stocked. They aren't as big as Fred Meyers but certainly has better service.
2805,Best Mexican in Anchorage. Great margaritas.
2806,Very nice park
2807,The Andy burger is the best burger in town!  Add the fried jalape√±os!
2808,Always loved this place. Great food.
2809,Average burger joint
2810,Smaller then I'm used to but it gets the job done
2811,"Ok good, the churro is a must, but the fried ice cream is a hard pass. Our waiter did not do a good job at all of listening to our table,  and multiple items were mixed up as well as our receipts at the end were completely wrong.  We had to figure out everybody's orders ourselves as he was too busy. I personally will not be back soon. I'm disappointed as this was a business dinner,  and we all went for good food and to relax."
2812,"I have gotten insurance through other places and there have always been problems with them, either service, coverage, payment  issues or difficulties when trying to get help with a claim.
Ever since I was a child my family has always had good experiences with State Farm. Whether we had it or the other party did we have always been treated well.
Now as an adult choosing my own insurance it was a natural choice to go with State Farm and Justin Goodman has kept up with the good work. Everytime I go in I'm greeted with a smile and genuine welcome. My questions are answered and problems handled by people who know what I need and never make me feel inferior or like they are in a rush."
2813,"Being from the South, I looked forward to trying Sonic food again. Being a new store I knew it would take a while to get our food. The line inside and out was incredibly long but took a chance anyway.

Waited 20 minutes in line and 45 minutes to get food. Then the order was not correct.

Saw many other have similar problems."
2814,"Always courteous, professional and great service."
2815,"Decent place. They are pulling in a fairly large crowd during the evenings. 80+% occupancy after 6. Atmosphere is good, but if your not in a talking mood it can seem loud. Foodwise i went with the lollapalooza to get a taste of everything. Felt is was the right chooce because I only enjoyed 1 out of 7 items. That being the poco pollo  funditio (chicken burrito for the laymens) most flavorful entree served. Its something i would go back for. The rice and beans were very bland and everyrthing else was covered with too much cheese, sour cream, or pockets if air for the fried foods. The chips weren't delicious like Juanitas. The spicy salsa was commendable. Staff stayed on point throughout my visit. Based on staff effort and poco polla I could see myself visiting again. However, El Dorado is still my number 1 mexican resturant in the city."
2816,This is a terrific Carrs
2817,"Best location in town for xcountry skiing, they groom their trails more than anywhere else. Added bonus: the inversion frequently causes warmer temperatures on the cold winter days."
2818,"I got both a facial and a massage both were great. I wish,however, that it wasn't so expensive to get personal care like this."
2819,"Long wait time of 50 minutes. Ordered beer, appetizers and 2 med pizzas for 3. Food was great, service was below average and we got our pizzas but no appetizer. Told server to forget appetizer since we already had pizza. Loss of revenue for Moose's Tooth."
2820,Love uncle Joe's
2821,This place is a hidden gem.
2822,Real Alaskan king crab !  Good crab cakes too!
2823,"I bought a KTUU deals from them. They stood me up twice. they are very unprofessional and when speaking in person with the ""son"" i felt threatened. I do not recommend them for any service."
2824,Great place and staff top notch!!
2825,"Great customer service, fast, consistent pizzas at good prices, especially for large orders. They really appreciate their customers!"
2826,One of the best Chinese food in Alaska.
2827,The host was very lazy with refilling or maintaining the grounds from the sites to the bathrooms!
2828,The pizza is in my top 3 fav.
2829,I came.. I saw.. I loved
2830,"They normally have more ""common"" parts *in stock* .. and they are about the most decent priced as well :)"
2831,"They took awesome care of my 3 furbabies for spaying...dr davidson is FANTASTIC...he actually took the time 2 explain everything with one they had problems with...he wasnt rushed, had me in a room where we could talk with very little noise...the staff is wonderful...nessy is an AWESOME person...very compassionate & loves animals & it shows..."
2832,"Well I  thought I would give this a few months to see if things would have improved. Needless to say, nothing has changed. Let's start with the staff. The only staff member  worth anything is Hannah my service tech. The manager Hunter is a very nice and I do believe he means well but the  guy and has been there for 17 years has lost complete control of the dealership. The inmates are running the asylum. My salesman has neither the class or the follow through to work at a Mercedes dealership. He needs to be transferred to the Kendall used car lot. The Finance Manager, well let's just say I rather have hot Bamboo splints stuck under my finger nails rather than deal with him again. No one has a glue what goes on at that dealership. I could go on and on but I will only list a few examples. Every time I leave that place I get heartburn. I had my vehicle there several times for warranty work often for several weeks at a time. One would think after having the vehicle that long they would have activated the second key. Wrong !. Again, I brought my vehicle in for service and it was in for several weeks. When I picked the vehicle up it was filthy dirty. On another occasion my vehicle was ready on a Saturday and was promised that the shuttle would pick me up. When I called, the new service tech, Kyle informed me there was no shuttle service on Saturday  even though it had been arranged with sales. I was told later that it appeared Sales forgot and he was very curt with me. The previous service adviser had about as much customer service skills as a clam. Hunter continues to hire people who are totally unfit for the positions they hold. Today I went to pick up my vehicle and the service adviser had gone and NO ONE had the foggiest notion where the key or the vehicle had gotten to. There is absolutely  NO communication within the organization There was a fellow customer with me today picking up her vehicle and she shared some of here horror stories with me and suggest I contact Kendall. She stated she would get better service from a Kia Dealership. Like I said, I could go on and on but these are just a few example and there are many more.. Kendall really does need to and clean house !

In response to the General Managers response. The solutions are very clear and have been outlined in the review. A complete management change. It's just that simple !"
2833,"Great prices, employees are friendly and helpful."
2834,Good vet care!
2835,"The food, staff, and view was great.  It was worth the drive from Anchorage."
2836,Poor service at breakfast buffet but fine location

2838,The place to shop.. Value for money .
2839,Quick and good service
2840,Someone is always willing to help and even knew what I was talking about even when I didn't.  üôÑ They are always great there.
2841,"These people are cheerful and over the top kind even at the end of the day!  To experience kindness and get a great chocolate shake, fries and burger and uno cards at 10 minutes before closing.  Wow.  I am going back!"
2842,"Bought a $2,000 generator here cash and was served well by the sales staff. When I ask about a credit score mistake to the top guy, he made a disparaging remark about my credit score and treated me with disrespect. Guy has obiously worked there too long if he pisses off  potential buyers. Credit problem corrected, I am now looking at a Polaris quad."
2843,This is where it all started.
2844,So pretty
2845,Rude staff
2846,I was too cold but the food was goooood
2847,"Not bad, as far as McDonalds go. Maybe better than most as far as cleanliness. Food was reasonably ok. Not hot but not cold. Later in the evening and low traffic, so I expected the fries to taste older. (This location is usually packed.) Service was prompt, friendly and helpful."
2848,Overpriced typical coffee shop items
2849,"Good clean environment, sometimes the 3D movies are slightly out of alignment."
2850,Incredible food beautiful atmosphere  Great customer service I highly recommend this place for sushi  And i'm Traveling from The Valley  It is worth the drive every time Not to mention the prices affordable prices ‚ô°‚ô°
2851,Always helpful and friendly
2852,"A simple menu filled with great dishes, and an awesome beer selection."
2853,"I'm so glad we have a full 18+ in the valley now. This is my favorite course and, as its heavily wooded, it's a fantastic place to practice. I come out early in the day and play through the evening frequently and never have an issue stacking with other disc golfers. Looking for more people to throw with!"
2854,Very good pizza and service. Come expecting at least a 30min wait for a table cause everyone wants to eat there.
2855,"It's under the construction,  but it must be good place for people."
2856,One of Anchorage's largest malls
2857,Best pizza in town...their craft beers are delicious... prepare to wait for a table for the chance to enjoy the deliciousness
2858,"I trust this company that I offered the rent however, manager proposed lower price than I offered that regards Pac Rim as a honest compnay.
Thanks."
2859,"This is such an awesome place! Love going here for lunch. I always get the Falafel pita or the Chicken Cesar. Can't go wrong here, everything is fresh!"
2860,Nice staff and awesome views out the window.  WiFi is very slow but that's understandable.  Certainly the best place to be in Whittier.
2861,Cool
2862,amazing testy food
2863,The ppl are very friendly. The ice cream is always delish
2864,Dave's  Monster Burger is the best burger in Juneau.
2865,"Best grocery store in Seward, AK."
2866,Small scary
2867,Excellent atmosphere & customer service.  The Pizza Margarita I had on my last visit was excellent. It's gastropub food done consistently well; but a touch overpriced.
2868,Still one of my favorite pancake Houses. Enjoyed the food as a kid. Enjoy the food as an adult.
2869,Expensive but the best place to get Mexican food. :)
2870,Unbelievable! Salmon!!! Swimming!!!
2871,Customer service is good
2872,Gotta go in summer. Gotta go especially Italy in winter.  The extra bucks for a tour is worth more than you expect.
2873,Salmon bake was great
2874,"Good food,  a bit pricey. Nice rooms."
2875,"The staff is always less than helpful when it comes to finding lost items. If there's a line for tickets, go inside and buy tickets with your card at the machine by customer service desk."
2876,"Great park. View and access to the river is awesome. The grass is well maintained. The kiddie play area is probably the most elaborate free playground south of Anchorage. Trails to hike, so many events scheduled, and a picnic/grill area that can be reserved. What's not to like?"
2877,"You wanna see Alaska Animals? You wanna take your kids out for a few hours? Gotta kill some time and want to do something that won't leave you bored, come here. It's neat to see animals you don't usually see in zoos. If you felt you've missed any alaska animals and you feel bad for missing it,come here. It's not too pricey and staff are nice."
2878,"A great selection of burgers!
My boys favorite restaurant!"
2879,Beautiful trail. Restroom facilities poorly maintained
2880,Awesome people
2881,It is McD's. It's clean s and what you expect üòâ

2883,The vets are amazing and very helpful! I have taken all my fur babies there since moving to AK 6 years ago.
2884,I was not there? I don't drink their products.
2885,I don't remember going here. Oh yeah I didn't I just dropped a friend off next door
2886,Friendly n clean area.
2887,This place is a safe place to meet others and seek help
2888,That Fred Meyer is to confusing to navigate
2889,The kids pool is Sooooo warm.
2890,21 minutes and counting waiting for pancakes and bacon
2891,good place for all your smoking needs
2892,"Place has a nice atmosphere, and the food was served fast and hot, but it was really bland. I got the house special the Garcia chimichanga, which is a big burrito thing full of shredded beef, covered with some kind of green chilli sauce. It looked great, but the meat was so bland that it really wasn't enjoyable.
Also, the mild salsa tasted like tomatoes and cilantro. I asked for the hot salsa and it tasted better, but was so hot I couldn't eat it.
Edit:
I had the Pollo Fundido and it was really good. The rest of my family had chicken meals and they were really good.
My recommendation? Make sure you get some kind of chicken meal. Not the beef."
2893,"This store reminds me of some of the places my mom used to take me to. You can buy stones, clothing, piercings, candles, incense, books, jewelry, and it is Alaskan owned."
2894,Pretty normal gas station.
2895,I was thrilled with the bouquet she provided for a birthday party. I will definitely be using her again
2896,Gorgeous. The entire area. Breathtaking. Rough road though. Be prepared. Worth it.
2897,Great place for lunch in downtown Anchorage.
2898,"They have barely any veriaty of donutes. I been to a lot of Krispy Kremes and this one is a waste. Bad employees poorly made donutes, and they make like 6 different kinds, I can get at the grocery store. Compare the website to the spot it's like night and day."
2899,"I can't eat the food Every single time at various times and items, I get severe stomach pain. MSG may be the issue."
2900,Greatest hotel in town! They have a lot of items for breakfast.  Conveniently located near the volume of activity in Juneau.
2901,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! The staff there get you in and out in minutes. Love going there for all my title and registration needs!
2902,the food is always amazing!! The ladies who run it are always very pleasant and friendly!! Best burger in town.

2910,Very attentive and helpful staff.
2911,"Very quiet, serene, beautiful place"
2912,Nice food store
2913,My kids can't stop saying 'how fun!' it was!!
2914,Restrooms lacked care as did the rest of the floors
2915,"This place is very costly and Everything is tiny! The rooms, bath tub, pool, and the breakfast portions.  No mini fridge, no microwave, just two servers of coffee and one creamer for each, no coffee in the lounge either.  Breakfast in the dining room is very highly priced as well.  The hot tub was like a whirl pool.  The only upside to this place was its cleanliness, views and location."
2916,"Great tourist spot to stop, but disappointed that shops are regularly closed durring ""business"" hours."
2917,Tram ride to the nature trail and park
2918,Good I had a salad with grilled chicken.
2919,It's about the same as most every other Dennys I have been to over the years.  Staff was exceedingly friendly.  Food came out as expected.
2920,"My FAVORITE place to eat!!!! Never been disappointed. Fast, friendly, super yummy at a great price!"
2921,Very very good pizza and friendly staff.

2925,Good food
2926,The pastor is a very nice man.
2927,"I repeatedly visit Humoys, it's a great environment inside. The food is delicious and is presented well. Excellent place to get food and drinks."
2928,"Nice hike to see the waterfall, but not for the faint of heart or those with a fear of heights.  Some parts of the trail are narrow with extremely dangerous drop offs."
2929,"Atmosphere was good. Live music not to loud, good songs. Got mixed seafood platter. Cod, halibut, calamari and fries. Very good for the money."
2930,"Called them about 2 doors for my truck they had listed online. Front one was listed for $250 and the back for $200.  Guy was very rude when i talked to him. Told me the front one was $500 and the rear was $400. I told him i seen them online for the price mentioned before. Said he didn't care, that's what he wants for them. So...whats the point of listing parts and prices online if your just going to argue about them? AVOID!"
2931,Luvd it
2932,Fish and chips was very good. So was the view.
2933,It's what one would expect from a touchless wash. It's great for removing winter snow but I wouldn't rely on it to wash my car. Best feature is the free vacuum.
2934,Great for breakfast
2935,Food and games
2936,Amazing amazing customer service. The girls are so friendly so kindThey made my shopping trip such an experience I was able to look and touch anything I wanted to try it on the prices are fair the quality isn‚Äôt the Maisie if you‚Äôre looking for on Mason gift for a special woman in your life I‚Äôd recommend getting her a new wallet or purse.
2937,Have sucky service
2938,I had heard for years that this place was really good.  I was disappointed and just glad that I did not have to pay since it was a company party.  I will not be rushing back anytime soon.
2939,"I love that they are still open, yet keeping everyone safe, walked in on a Saturday night, only handful of people yet still felt a little bit of normalcy... only missing James being behind the bar singing!"
2940,Nice property close to the park.
2941,Beautiful.  Wish we had time to take the tour.
2942,Fast friendly service. Food was fresh and delicious
2943,The food is exactly what you would expect. Service is usually happy but the turn around on food is typically slow.
2944,Outstanding customer service excellent variety of all types of material and other items for sewing and knitting and great selection of sewing machines will be back
2945,Usual Subway menu and service. Pretty good actually.
2946,Got pretty pricey since we started going there.

2948,"Okay place. Sometimes gets my order completely wrong, but fairly cheap for decent quality Mexican."
2949,"Intimate, cozy, and delicious"
2950,Loved the zoo. Great pictures of the animals. Loved that the walk around as it was very natural. Easy to see all th animals within 1.5 hrs if you have tight time schedule.

2957,Great food. The best mushrooms in Town.
2958,Always find great deals
2959,"They have great deals, the staff is very friendly and professional. They talk to you like a friend and make it a pleasant visit. I would recommend this place to anyone."
2960,Favorite place to get pizza in Anchorage!
2961,"My first impression was how clean this establishment is. Then the hot tea omg!! So very delicous..and endless refills! We then ordered a vegetarian platter drool, with chicken..i ate until I was ready to pop. AMAZING FOOD!!"
2962,"The only reason they get 1 star is that the food is great! The chain is known for great food but this location is an embarrassment. The service here is the worst I've ever encountered on a consistent basis. They have a reputation of horrible service (orders are wrong 80% of the time) and very long wait times. They are a ""joke"" within the Anchorage community. Management knows the negatives and yet seems to not care about their reputation -horrible..."
2963,Friendly employee's.
2964,Prices go up portions go down
2965,FASTFOOD FAST
2966,One of the best restaurants in Eagle River. I have not had a bad experience here and I've been/ordered here at least 30 times (maybe more). I love that they make great & consistent food and they deliver ($30 minimum required). If you dine-in they give you free soup. They also have a full menu of sushi which has always been fresh. Definitely recommend. You wont be disappointed.
2967,Did me right on a used Silverado.
2968,"The first time I ate here, it was awesome.  Then they changed owner and I felt the food lacked and service was so so"
2969,Rosalia is helpful and very friendly!!! It was kinda busy but she kept great communication!!! Love this store!
2970,"Had the parts I needed and at a good price. Don't need the expensive tools as I'm not a professional mechanic, so the cheap AutoZone tools work for me. Just a regular vehicle owner needing to fix a family truck."
2971,Best prices in town for a full synthetic oil change. And really great people too
2972,"Good pizza, good water, good service."
2973,"The beverage service was great; that was our primary objective. There were 5 of us. We were able to sit in a street side, open air pavilion during this Corona Virus time. Very pleasant and distanced spacing, safety precautions were taken. We had great tasting hard ciders by Double Shovel, as well as a couple of local micro brews, Midnight Sun and King Street..

We only went for an appetizer and that day was not the day for the Spinach Dip. The taste would have been great had it not been burnt. Don't know why it was burnt; the kitchen wasn't busy. The pita bread (their house pizza crust) served with it was very tasty.

Because of the location and outside seating, I'm sure we'll be back."
2974,Great service
2975,Always a great price and friendly service.
2976,Always fresh
2977,"Gets my car clean, great deal on monthly rate."
2978,I always stop by for dinner and drinks when I am in town.
2979,I went with my beautiful friend and our kiddos to have lunch. It was busy inside but we had good service and great meals. Portions were enough to bring and eat more at home.
2980,Pretty Alaskan!  You can get everything here from food to game traps to automotive supplies. $$$
2981,Nice facility. Has more than enough for anyone to get a good workout in. Unless you're there during peak hours and it seems like everyone is working in groups of 5 or more. Other than that the equipment is nice. I haven't used the pool or sauna but those are great features as well...so I've heard.
2982,Great hamburgers and zucchini sticks!  Loved the Alaska decor and the service was friendly and very nice!
2983,Cool place to shop at
2984,Always love the chilly beans or taco salad for always good food or bacon nator or bacon nator fries or frosty..
2985,Usually it's great but their ATM was out of money this time so we didn't get to purchase anything. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2986,Really good pub style food. Nice and clean bar area.
2987,Love their juice selection and that they make it themselves too. Good place

3002,I would highly recommend it to anybody that smokes good THC hybrid sativa or indica
3003,I set up an appointment through their website to get a test done. Got there and called and was told to keep my phone on me for them to call me or text me. I sat for an hour since there were others there when I arrived. I called and got an automated message saying they are experiencing higher than usual call volumes. When I finally got ahold of someone I was told they would be with me soon. Waited another hour and still heard nothing. I called again and they said they would call me back within 5 minutes only to not be called back for over 15 minutes. Ended up having to wait for over two hours overall. Worst experience with any medical professional I've ever had hands down.
3004,Great convenience store.
3005,Family friendly place. All you need for an outing with family.
3006,"Quick easy access to a bunch of foods and drinks nobody should consume, AND ALCOHOL!"

3009,"All DMV & UMV locations you have to wait in line,I absolutley loath going to either of these locations for that reason however the wait here  was only about 20 minutes which is lightspeed compared to a DMV and the individual helping me was incredibly nice and soft spoken."

Car was picked up by Benjamin at 1130... Dropped off at 515 windows done and they vaccumed up all the glass. Grade A service.

3027,Nicely eclectic collection of arts and crafts supplies at surprisingly good prices. I would have rated it higher if they carried air brush paint.
3028,"Surprisingly great. You can tell a lot of money has been put into this place. The computer lab is by far one of the best places to use on post. Not to mention a bar, pool tables, and game systems. All within walking distance of most barracks."
3029,Nice and clean great breakfast
3030,Really exceptional food and awesome salsa bar.
3031,Was not expecting such a great menu in Healy. Great beers and great food. Try the Yak Burger.
3032,"I had read some reviews that said this was a moderate hike.  We felt it was a little more strenuous with steep climbs, stairs and a rock scramble with no discernible path at the top for the last 500 feet.  We are so happy we stayed the course though because the sights are breathtaking.  Bring lots of water especially in summer since there is not much shade along the path."

3046,This is a nice mall and I really love Brow Chica Brow. I just wish there were more shops in the place
3047,This place has really gone down hill from a few years ago. Chicken has been friend out the last few times we ordered and Mongolian beef is usually overcooked. Sad to say this is not as good as it was just 5 years ago.
3048,Sweet
3049,Everything was fine until the parking lot was full because they let an rv park in the lot. Bs
3050,These guys are always extremely helpful and very knowledgeable! Every time I go in there they always get everything I need taken care of right away!
3051,Only place I could find with a coat that fit my dog
3052,"The establishment is really well kept and the customer service is always pretty good. The bathrooms are always pretty clean as well. The only complaint I'd have about this and most village inns is that the waiters can be a bit clueless or hard to talk to. This might be because I'm coming in when there's a bunch of new hires, not too sure. It also takes a long time for food to come sometimes.

I mean I get that restaurants usually take a while to get you your food, but every other visit it seems my food is a little cold when it did ally gets to the table. Overall a good experience, just some annoying nit picks here and there."
3053,All generations of my family have drank here.
3054,"I googled top 5 tire shops in Anchorage, this one came up.  I emailed the shop, asked a couple questions.  What got me was how quick they responded to my questions and the follow up phone call.  Dropped my car off at approx 1pm, told it should be ready by 5.  Mind you I was getting new tires put on rims, AND and an oil change.  I got a call at 330pm car was ready.
Thank you Thank you Alignment Center and Alaska Car & Truck.
Will definitely make another trip for oil change and possible new rims put on.   Definitely recommend to some one who is not very mechanical"
3055,Good prime rib
3056,Absolutely fabulous customer service matching the quality of food served.
3057,Great food + great beers nuff said.
3058,"It's actually called filis pizza, and it's great"
3059,Wish they would bring back buck hunter
3060,Service is outstanding and the food is beyond amazing
3061,Rosie was an awesome sales representative.  No pushy tactics.  Great experience.
3062,Great if you can find a table!
3063,Parking lot is rough. Car wash is clean. Vacuums need improvement
3064,"Solid, classic burgers."
3065,Morning crew makes it right
3066,Generally unhappy staff. Clean facility. Large selection. Your generic WalMart
3067,"The absolute best McDonald's in Fairbanks bar none!!!! Never a wrong order,  not ever made to wait,  the crew is very nice and makes you feel like you matter.  I have been eating at McDonalds for 42 years even had my 1st birthday party at the 1st McDonald's in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, I totally stopped going because of the one across from wal mart could not get anything right not even proper assembly of the food, was always made to wait with a road cone on my roof, the crew was rude and clueless. But this McDonald's restored my love for the food and even know I have to drive across town after already traveling 50 to town I do it just because of this place. Cant say anything wrong,  I can just recommend you give it a try!!!"
3068,They aren't interested in people buying campers. Showed up to make a purchase no one around. Walked around looked and left
3069,Okay prices...no shoes or boots in my size tho
3070,Mmmm delicious pizza!
3071,Costumer service was a little rude
3072,Pricey but good food
3073,Slow service when I went. Waited for about 20 minutes. Granted their was a line so they were busy but they sure didn't look like they were pushing to get past the rush. A little too casual for my taste. Beyond that it was great.
3074,"(Translated by Google) The park is a real gem to visit, it is something you cannot miss. Fortunately, I have had to visit it in the fall season, when the leaves turn yellow, orange and red and the combination with green is wonderful. Just driving on the highway is beautiful, something you cannot miss and definitely one of the best roads with a view in the US.

El parque es una verdadera joya para visitar, es algo que no te puedes perder. Por fortuna me ha tocado visitarlo en temporada de oto√±o, cuando las hojas se vuelven amarillas, naranjas y rojas y la combinaci√≥n con verde es maravilloso. Simplemente manejar por la carretera es bell√≠simo, algo que no te puedes perder y definitivamente una de las mejores carreteras con vista de EUA"
3075,Good price and clean place
3076,Beautiful Lodge with beautiful view
3077,"Friendly and fun vibe. A place to feel comfortable, make new friends and dance."
3078,"The morning of Friday March 25 2021 about 7 or 8 am. An elder 58yr went in to eat some breakfast drink some coffee read the news paper at the cookie jar. The staff brought him to a table, so he waited for a menu Well others came in and they were seated with menus. Eventually Their meals showed up. So the Elder attempted to ask one of staff about a menu, the staff walked pass and continued to Ignore him. So after the other customers Finished with their meal he decided to get up and leave.  That's a sad way to treat your elders. Majority of Fairbanks restaurants take care of their elders.Please help us bring attention to the situation by either pressing the like or any other action on this comment. No Elder should go through this. Thank you for taking the time to read this"
3079,Great info on the refuge and its wildlife and amenities- well worth the time to visit.
3080,Very helpful staff. Got exactly what I needed.
3081,"(Translated by Google) Close to the port

3082,"It's a Walmart in a city. Big, busy, messy and gross. I avoid this one."
3083,Napoli's Philly - no mushrooms. Best Ever. Can't be beat. The ranch dressing is really good too.
3084,Very clean and well maintained.
3085,They have so many choices to fit my food allergies I'm like a kid in a candy store. There salad bar and hot food bar is absolutely delicious! I will be going back to get lunch there again.
3086,"4stars because of OnceUponABlueMoose and AlaskaSaltCo....Dan's the man for sure, definitely a badass dude. thanks for the knowledge, I learned a lot todayüëçüëç that mall is fortunate to have you"
3087,Busy or not you can expect world class service and AAA+ food.
3088,Great little place with lots of local small town charm. They will know your name after just a few visits. Food is good and cooked well. I like the reindeer sausage breakfast.
3089,Food is meh but honestly you go here for the sports or for the games. Everyones food came out dry but other than that it was good. The employees were nice and our server was awesome! I appreciate after 10PM they limit it to onlt adults.
3090,Clean and organized. No issues finding all we need.
3091,"This is the only place I will take my truck! Good prices for anchorage. Comes out shiny clean every time. Other places do not always get off all the dirt and grime, but Pink Elephant leaves my truck looking brand new!"
3092,"They forgot to give me 2 items, but after I went back in, I got them."
3093,Pizza was pretty good.  Service was a little erratic but they did a good job making up for it in the end.  Mistakes happen and that's life but they handled it well!
3094,Good dinner and prayer on wednesday night at the well for free dinner downstairs
3095,Dealing with Thai and Rich is a treat. They are very knowledgeable and answer any question you have. There's a reason so many people deal with Alyeske Tire.
3096,"The first time we at here we thought the food was amazing! Every visit since has just been ok. While most times we carry out the food & bring it home (about a 7 minute drive), times we've dined it have been about the same! However I recommend you eat there for lunch as you get about double the food for the same price! And the Mongolian Beef is their best dish!"
3097,"Great service, breakfast was simple and good. Their workers were helpful and so nice. The rooms were great and clean Only thing was at the time the pool had a lot of chlorine but at least you knew it was clean."
3098,"Quite possibly the best restaurant in the state. Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious, but with a decidedly ""Alaska casual' decor that invites you to eat amazing food without worrying about getting dressed up. The prime rib routinely runs out, so get their early if you're craving some horseradish-y goodness."
3099,"Always happening in the summer, a nice back yard adventure"
3100,"Never had a bad experience here. Not for take out, eat in, anything! Staff is great, food is even better, and the memories are irreplaceable! Favorite Mexican restaurant on the Peninsula."
3101,This place is hella cool.. let my dog in every about him people are friendly drinks are strong
3102,They have a little of everything
3103,This post is a retraction to an earlier review.   2020 has been a time of change for many us and my experience at the motorcyle shop the last couple of days has been amazing.   The new service manager is a really nice and competent guy. The work was professional and efficient. I could not be happier.  The owner spent a lot of time with us as well and really helped us decide on a new bike.  We look forward to making a purchase this winter.
3104,Great place for tires and rims.  Friendly service
3105,Helpful staff and they have what I need for my pets.

3111,great service!!!
3112,Joe Z is an awesome dude.  Definitely attentive to needs and is an excellent help...
3113,"Excellent breakfast place. Can expect a delay at certain times, but the food makes it worth it. They do take reservations, next time I will make them. I had the breakfast burrito smothered with a green chile sauce. Made my nose run. My husband had an eggs Benedict with a crab cake and a salmon cake. The salmon cake was better, but he enjoyed them both."
3114,"Good food, awesome view!"
3115,Very good
3116,Lot of great books and great staff
3117,"Mmmm Mmmmm, great!!!"
3118,Great for a quick fill up.
3119,"Jon has come twice to our church to instruct separate groups on AED/CPR Trauma. The guy is a FANTASTIC instructor. Knowledgeable,  engaging, thorough. NO one fell asleep in his classes! And we all came out of it feeling confident, informed and able to handle a crisis situation.
AND the equipment we purchased is easy to understand and use.
Thank you!!!"
3120,Great food.  Good service.  Pleasant dining  experience
3121,The coffee is good but the shots in the Americano always taste a little burned. Great hot chocolate though!
3122,Best place I have been in anchorage so far
3123,Wait an hour for nachos
3124,"Friendly guys and good products along with good value.
Nice store atmosphere with great hours, and a loyalty program and sales.
You will come out with what you want & happy."

3126,Fun little place!
3127,"The diner is my morning choice for Fairbanks. Consistently quality service, food, cleanliness and prices. Thank you Diner!"
3128,"Awesome place, great food, great staff"
3129,"Great place to save on gas ,if you shop at Fred Meyers"
3130,"Great place to eat! Burgers were close to best in town and great, friendly, personable staff. Loved the interior of the restaurant with a nice local, rustic feel."
3131,"We appreciated the kindness and courtesy of the salespeople. Some stores we visited prior to Ashley, the salespeople treated us as another commission piece and not a genuine buyer. Ashley HomeStore were very thorough and efficient in the transaction of a new bedroom set for our children. They were patient as the kids tested each one to see what would fit them. Thank you!! We will gladly recommend them and come again for future purchases at the Anchorage midtown store."
3132,"Subpar hotel, although the bar downstairs is fun.

Update: they are now charging 200 dollars a night this is insane as this a 100 a night hotel at best."
3133,"It's a nice place for coffee and a snack, service is good. The staff are nice and  the selection is okay."
3134,I love everything about this place! I have an enjoyable experience everytime I set foot in this theater. The employees are very friendly and do their jobs well. The seats are really comfortable! They have a great selection at concessions and they have the BEST popcorn!
3135,Very poor customer relations did not do very well keep on their rental properties and not very good care to the renties
3136,Was extremely busy at the time I visited..if your in a 'rush' not a good place 2 visit then...
3137,Very clean store very nice selection everything is Fresh
3138,Penney's is the only major department store in Anchorage. I can find petite sizes in there
3139,Meat is very good and they will cut it to your specifications.
3140,These ladies fixed my horrible haircut from sport clips. Took thier time to help me out. And actually spoke with me while doing it. Thanks so much!
3141,This is a take out pizza place. If you are looking for a place to sit and have lunch or dinner this is not the place.   The pizza is great otherwise.   Customer service was so so.  The prices is also ok we shared a medium pizza with a can of soda for $10.
3142,Best clam chowder ever
3143,Excellent inventory and very congenial staff.
3144,Still LOVE the chili!
3145,"Good food, service"
3146,Place is super reasonable and they know what they are doing.  Only place I will go to.
3147,"Staff was nice but obviously short staffed/poorly utilized. I waited for about 15 minutes for a table, then 15 minutes for a server, after which I got my coffee quickly and food shortly after that. The first cup had a crack (and was leaking coffee) which the server noticed before I did. I had a replacement cup almost immediately. The servers never stopped moving and were busy. Food was good, about what I expect from a Denny's. Another server or two or a better game plan would do wonders for this place."
3148,Food was delicious and service was amazing. A little spendy though.
3149,"Always great service, drive-through is awesome."
3150,We must have been taken care of by a new very inexperienced salesman. Terrible experience.  Wanted to charge us a restocking fee for a phone we didn't even purchase yet. Took him 10 minutes to set up the sale & over an hour to cancel it.
3151,Good
3152,Great selections. Fresh produces
3153,Prices way to high.....
3154,"Very helpful staff, a large variety of pet supplies and it is dog friendly"
3155,Great views!  Awesome food and üç∫!!!  Love the draft selection!
3156,"Loved this place, you can order pizza from Flattop Pizza, which is ajoined. They are owned by the same person. The pizza and environment was great."
3157,Always love homedepot
3158,Frequently my go to for breakfast
3159,This is a great Lowes store.  Good customer service and place is kept clean.
3160,Its pretty good m son is happy  and i am full
3161,"Wow I ordered the 3 of the 3 choice dinners taco, chimichanga, and chilli reaino...one of the best I have had around Anchorage!!! Big plate of food too! I'm stuffed"
3162,"Being from New Mexico (naturally a little snobby about Mexican food), I gave the enchiladas a try - with the green sauce. They were extremely good for how far we are from the south.. All of the local beers available with the theatre and great service, this truly is a gem in Anchorage. Everyone needs to go at least once."
3163,"It's a pretty typical hotel, the atomosphere and restaurant service are above average and nice. Beer and burger on Wednesday is required."
3164,The 3/4 hour wait time turned into almost 2 hours.
3165,Very good along side the Fred Meyers chain
3166,"Very convenient with grocery store, hardware store, sporting good store, beer and liquor store, and gas pumps. Clean and new with friendly workers, hope it stays that way."
3167,It's polar bear park
3168,A lot of sales going on all the time. Great customer service and atmosphere.
3169,kkl good staff great places
3170,"Buckets has the best burgers! When we come down here from Anchorage, we always have to stop!üíñ"
3171,Week old pulled pork that tasted like it was warmed up in a microwave and dropped on a stale bun.... No thanks. Also there was some kind of hostile confrontation going on between two of the servers...
3172,Family nights are great.
3173,Nice camp!
3174,So glad they made a bigger room for darters
3175,Lots of trails
3176,Lovely beach with a wonderful playground for the kids.
3177,Incredible and easy walking trails
3178,"Tam did an amazing job from start to finish. I went for a fill, trim and new gel color. I was traveling a lot so I was in a different city when it was time to get them done. This is the best experience I had in the last 4 years."
3179,Beautiful course. Friendly staff. Love the location.
3180,I love the bench by the water.

3182,"Great little museum. Our family enjoyed all the exhibits, especially the hands on ones."
3183,"The folks are fantastic and the extra groceries help a lot. I enjoyed going for the free lunch. Their homemade soups are delicious as are the salads. Bread, peanut butter and jelly are always available for those who don't want the soup du jour or want to have soup and sandwich."
3184,I think I gave the ducklings most of my fries. Best restaurant I've been to yet.
3185,Had my grandsons birthday party here. Both adults and kids had fun with go carts and other games. I will be back to do Lazer Tag and more Go-Carts!
3186,Great place for lunch
3187,Really good BBQ and pizza excellent service
3188,"Quick service, friendly staff.
Picked up some Scones, Cookies and a Cinnamon Roll. We tried a little of everything and it was all Delicious ‚ò∫"
3189,"Great place for Hawaiian inspired breakfast, lunch and dinner. My family and I enjoy the food here. Large portions. And good service too. Nice and family friendly restaurant."
3190,Might be the worst dining experience in Fairbanks. Came around 2pm the day after Thanksgiving. Restaurant appeared to be only 50  percent full. Ordered a Loco Moco and Seafood Alfredo. Didn't get our food until 35 minutes later. Loco Moco was very underseasoned. It appeared that all they did was slap ground beef on the grill and placed it over rice and topped it off with some gravy. The Seafood Alfredo could have definitely been a lot better specially for the price. The sauce tasted like the canned version. The staff also forgot to serve garlic bread and soup that came with the Alfredo. Overall this restaurant is located in a nice location. Definitely noticed the interior upgrades compared to the previous location. However food and service quality need some serious overhaul.
3191,The place to shop for food and products not available at the usual chain supermarkets. Very reasonable prices and super weekly specials.
3192,It‚Äôs a very friendly environment and has basically everything you need for home improvements
3193,The service was very good.
3194,Same ghetto everywhere.
3195,Delicious food and great service
3196,The desserts were excellent. We tried the cheesecake and the strawberry ruebarb cobbler. The salmon was a bit disappointing but the reindeer meatballs and duck were very nice. The decor is very Alaskan and though the prices are not cheap I did not find them unreasonable. The best divining experience I have had in Fairbanks thus far.
3197,"Great food, coffee, and atmosphere!"
3198,Everyone is so friendly!
3199,Only complaint is how expensive food/drink was
3200,"Dennis helped me with my Chrysler 300c today and i loved the service! He wasn't pushy to get a purchase, he answered any and all questions and got everything done within an hour and a half! Very friendly salesman, very honest and very helpful! Ill be back in a couple years for a new buy!! WELL DONE PAYLESS!! THANK YOU!! I love my car!"
3201,Didn't  give excellent customer service.  Treated women and foreign  customers badly.  I will never come back. Mocking customers as they waited for vehicles to be serviced. Didnt act like they wanted to fix my breaks. Here in little alaska  doesn't have a lot of options. I was about to ask about tired id Rather go to Costco tire center.
3202,Amazing scenery. A must see in alaska.
3203,Beautiful day for a dig walk at Eagle Beach.
3204,Great store... but they surely can afford to keep that parking lot in better shape in the show and ice!! :-/
3205,"I travel to Anchorage for work often. Best hotel I have stayed in. Recently built, everything is new. The breakfast is great and the diner is just as good if you don't want to get out."
3206,dollar spot gets me everytime.... I am a sucker for a cheap sale and i live for the dollar spot. I love the quailty of clothes i get  from missimo for women. The beauty products are expanding which i like. The pizza is delicous from pizza hut but starbucks could use some work the last 2 times i got something it was gross. Otherwise the workers are helpful when finding something. And paitent when helping me understand how to use cartwheel app.
3207,This is a fantastic location and setup. Welcoming and cozy in the best of ways.
3208,Very professional service and very friendly.
3209,"These people all seem kind, smart and do there job efficient.

From forum post saw that a PTO/ptu fluid swap would be around $200 so I didn't ask for a quote also I knew that a transflush is rather easy on the taurus so I thought I'd add that too

Glad the service writer called back to let me know the estimate for both is $700 so just got the ptu done for $350 two hour job with $150hr labor."
3210,"Our order was way off, wrong sandwich, missing item, no sauces, we should have checked before we left. The real disappointment though is the quality of the food. When they first opened it was good,  but the last couple visits,  it seems to be getting worse every time."
3211,It's a great place for kids and families. However it has not been taken care of during this whole covid thing. When things get back to normal I am sure it will be beautiful and well maintained. The views front the park are also great.
3212,Such sandwich!  Very wow!
3213,Poor produce selection. High price
3214,Beautiful arena great condition and very spacious. Parking could use some improvement in size and quality.
3215,It's okay I just wish they had more people there that knew what they were doing instead of a bunch of teenagers that don't
3216,They stole my information and lied and would not give me my paper work back and defraud mme to
3217,Crowded poor design for Alaska
3218,Great service great food
3219,Its was pizza.
3220,The kids love this playplace.  It's huge!  But it seems like like the staff have a hard time keeping up with the flow of people.  The food was good and it was pleasant to have it delivered to the table.  The downside was how difficult it was to keep the kids in sight.  The play area is divided by a wall and seating in the main section is almost always full (and awkward).
3221,"Nice guys, great tires they picked out for me. Decent prices too for the area."
3222,The service was amazing. The menu selection was huge. The order came to my table super fast. It was delicious. My first choices on the menu were not available. I would go again.
3223,"Garcia's is one of my favorite local restaurants. I love the simplified menu, the atmosphere is amazing, and the service is great. My only complaint is the food can be inconsistent, at times being some of the best and at times feeling uninspired. It's never bad, though, and I know this last year has been tough."
3224,Amazing Pizza!!!  Definitely the new pizza hot spot of Fairbanks...makes College Town a thing of the past!!
3225,Great facility. Friendly staff.  Great place for the whole family to stay fit and have fun.
3226,"I went here for my birthday and the service is really nice, highly recommended"
3227,"Service was good and the people at the window were great. The food was okay, but I'm not a big fan of Wendy's anyway."
3228,Very helpful guys here!
3229,I like this place they keep it clean and have good food pleasant place to stay
3230,Love the garage sales! Went for a new Outdoor Research mask
3231,"This place is a HUGE health code and child labor violation. I feel like absolutel trash after eating the ice cream. Such a shame that this was so terrible, because it is the only place in town."
3232,"Love the atmosphere and location is also good. Customer service is great as well as personable to a degree. When they delivered our couch, they weren't readily knowledgeable about how to get it in the door. Luckily my fiance was home for lunch and he helped get it inside our mobile home."
3233,Excellent service. Kind and knowledgeable
3234,"Best sushi and sashimi in Anchorage.  Consistently delicious. Generous, expert cuts."
3235,Good section of Yeti mugs
3236,TiVo is great.  Prices are a bit high on cable and especially the internet.  They don't really have an unlimited package so the monthly bill can get a bit pricey once you've reached your plan.
3237,Nothing there
3238,Great place to go.
3239,"This place sucked, nothing worked.. out of order signs on everything, then a employee didn't want us to use our own soap... It was dirty in there... Definitely will not be going back  there... Poor customer service as well..."
3240,"I only go to taco bell once a year or so, and it's always terrible."
3241,Awesome little grocery store in the middle of nowhere. Great selection
3242,"The location and ambiance are fantastic and the service was acceptable but the food was a disaster. Cold, congealed and unappetizing after waiting 45 minutes for it to arrive, I sent it back only to have the same plate brought back to me after being microwaved. I will NOT return to Everett's."
3243,Cool place to visit and enjoy the park with a picnic
3244,"Who doesn't love going to state parks and getting back to nature.
Be aware the bears are out and carry bear spray in the summer."
3245,Had a great time with friends here. This is a very busy place so it takes a bit longer to get food. Go there knowing that and enjoy yourself its worth the wait.
3246,The carpet smells like it has never been cleaned. The food was so so... Cobwebs on some of the chandeliers.. I think it must have been good maybe 20 years ago. üñì
3247,"Amazing park, you can just walk so close to tge glacier. The only part of Kenai Fjords national park that can be reached by road. The only glacier that you can walk to. Summer temps are ok, light jacket will suffice. Amazing photo opportunites."
3248,I lived there be for
3249,Loved it. Where to go when you need a lift in spirit.
3250,These folks are disorganized every time I go. I'm usually sorry I even bothered. Only go there at my mother's request to pick up her pizza.
3251,Best cinnamon rolls in town!
3252,What a great show for the hole family!
3253,Good steaks but pretty dingy and spendy
3254,These guys are great. Picked up a nail and had a slow leak in my tire. They were able to schedule on the same day (early winter snow day no less) and patched it quick. Very fast.
3255,"Food is always consistent and good. Shrimp Tempura is so good there, and nice and clean. Been going for over 30yrs  now I think
Lots of other places to go but for consistency and always friendly service and refreshed line always, this place still rocks"
3256,Got food here with couple of people. Loved the cup they had so I decided to buy one for myself. Luckily they got several for sale in different colors.
3257,Sometimes the one lady messes up on orders when you want take out
3258,"Great place to for large portion and all homemade. So 4 great service and food, reasonable $$.It's a must."
3259,"It's a pretty typical hotel, the atomosphere and restaurant service are above average and nice. Beer and burger on Wednesday is required."
3260,The food was good. Did not have to wait long for a table but the service was just okay. Very pretty views of the waterfront if you get a table near the windows. Good food options for kids available.
3261,"We had leaking from our shower into our bottom floor and it took them an hour to figure out what it was, we had a small hole in our shower surrounding. After they found out, they packed up and left without charging us nearly as much as they could have."
3262,Great customer service.
3263,Great organization and takes donations for a worthy cause.
3264,Excellent
3265,"(Translated by Google) Woohhh

Woohhh"
3266,"Exactly the kind of place I wish I had grow up near. Friendly helpful staff, frequent in store events, and good prices... Unless you want Warhammer figures, but that's on Game's Workshop, not the store owners."
3267,Warm beer stale jokes
3268,What can I say they really help me out
3269,Got a catback muffler put on my GX. Talked to me on the phone about it after hours to get it all straightened out. Quoted me a good price and then beat the estimate for a great price. Definitely would go back to them for other mods

3275,"This place is by far my favorite place! Great food, great customer service. Happy and friendly staff. I had a great time and will be returning."
3276,Much better than any Walmart in Hawaii
3277,Good selection.
3278,Not much of a visitor center. Just some signs at a pullout on the side of the road. Informative and cool to take pictures with the pipeline.
3279,"Unsure... been here a few times. Too many kids running around. Upscale chuck e cheeses... wish they kicked them out sooner than 10, so we could drink and be merry, and not have 12 year olds with their parents debit cards and stupid hair cuts running around. Foods is ok. Service is slow. Drinks are  overpriced."
3280,They have a delicious and diverse menu. The atmosphere is cozy :)
3281,"(Translated by Google) As a luxury lazi, Alaska Korean tourists stay and eat here.

3282,Nice place
3283,"I moved here to Alaska from NYC a few months ago. I moved here because I realized my ideals weren't agreeable with NYC.

I came here today and paid 85 dollars for an oil change.

I guess there are people who have NYC ideals here in Alaska as well."
3284,"Great breakfast here. Very nice atmosphere and friendly service, coffee was perfect"
3285,Awsome! Great customer service and one of the biggest REI stores I've ben in!

3287,Good food.  Cold beer.  Great place to watch float planes come on and off the water!
3288,Good drinks and a nice menu!
3289,"First visit, staff warm, supportive and informed. My dentist retired, not much on starting over but found on web and reviewed, drawn to Drs. Capua and Harr...training, focus and patient priority.

At this point I believe they are a 5 but we can all improve...next appointment soon."
3290,Good Bloody Mary and bar pizza. Sad they don't have the chicken parmesan on brunch menu.
3291,"Nice relaxing and very informative morning on the boat.
We were welcomed with free hot coffee and homemade blueberry donuts.
Don't want to spoil anything but made several stops to learn more about the people and history."
3292,Overpriced with the $2.25 bottles of water that I get from Costco for 10 cents. But the kids had fun and I understand the cost of doing business. Will be back because my kids keep asking me about it.
3293,"Crowded, but always clean"
3294,The appointment ability is awesome.  Recommend doing that.
3295,Excellent
3296,Best üçï and service ever ‚ù£
3297,You should try their cookies and creme frapp
3298,"Went there twice in a couple of days, first time was a Wed night a d service was slow, food was ok.  Went there again on the following Sat night and service was much better (even though they were busier) and food was better."
3299,Yum!
3300,"I lived the food here! The service was incredibly slow, especially when getting the check was concerned. My wife and I LOVED the vinegar-based sauce. The hot link was probably my favorite but there's no way I would pay the $4/link they were asking to take away."
3301,Always helpful and polite
3302,Fun
3303,"Cool shop, friendly staff, and great product."
3304,"Due to covid restrictions you need an associate to walk you through the store. Younger guy I was given rushed the entire process and was pushing me to either make a decision or leave so he could get to another customer.

Here's the thing buddy, I need more than 46 seconds to make a purchase of 2 grand.

It got to the point where he moved to the door without me, then came to me (as I didnt want to see anything that way) to make a decision or go.

Will not be back, even without the mandate."
3305,Friendliest staff ever
3306,Service was slow but on point
3307,Great tasting pizza and their meatball sandwich is fantastic. The staff is very nice.
3308,"They were out of almost every meat with the exception of chicken and goat.  Food was very good.  Had the chicken vindaloo.  Very spicy hot, and delicious.  Can be ordered mild."
3309,Great produce and healthy options. My go to for grocery most the time.

3315,"I was there under unhappy circumstances, but their office staff was friendly and helpful!"
3316,I would give 5 star's but they are just a little pricey.lol. great staff
3317,This is where to go when you need a 5 star carwash at an affordable price.!!
3318,Great place to get your Warrior on
3319,good food :) enjoyed my meal
3320,Had the chicken and waffles for lunch. Absolutely delicious and the best French fries I‚Äôve ever had. Will definitely be coming back.
3321,"resident. Im a local resident and checked out plenty of hotels. This hotel was very nice. Nice pool, dining area and staff was pleasant.

I had a 1 bedroom suite. It was beautiful. It had a mini fridge( wish it was a full size fridge), it also had silverware and much more.
I also was allowed to bring in my big birthday balloons.

This hotel had better prices then other suites in town and it was nice and modern.

Thank you Brittney and Vinshu/Abou."
3322,"Oh, what a grand time.  We have dined here on multiple visits to Anchorage and have always enjoyed.  Tonight we started with foie gras with pistachio nut dusting, followed by a fall panella salad,  entree of octopus. ..excellent! !  Finished off with chocolate cake and a beautiful meyer lemon tart with housemade vanilla ice cream."
3323,Lovely
3324,"Upscale-ish American food, think pizza and tater tots, with an amazing bar+burbon selection. An excellent place for a date or a lazy afternoon. Can be quite crowded during the dinner hour."
3325,"Nice atmosphere, and the food is great.
Oh and what a great view."

3333,A great way to spend an afternoon. They have daily critter chats where they show you the animal if the day up close with a few snacks. We had a lot of fun I definitely suggest it!
3334,"GREAT experience this time. My 2yr old was very tired and bouncy.. She spilled my drink and our waitress made us feel like it was nothing. Cleaned it up in less than a min üò≤üëçüëç
At the end of our meal our kids were brought balloons üíúüíö"
3335,Good service. Tasty food
3336,We like a dat coffee shop .cool place to people watch while your downtown
3337,They do a great job of ski trails in the winter and running/disk golf in the summer
3338,Had my laptop in for repair and they were rather quick to get back to me. No luck on fixing it due to the cost...HP let me down. Service was prompt unlike my willingness to pick up my new paper weight.
3339,"We are locals to the valley.  Did not care too much for the pizza sauce.  Also, they do not put very much cheese on the pizzas.  It was just an ok pizza in my opinion.

Service was extremely slow.  Took over a half hour to get our pizza once we ordered and it wasn‚Äôt that busy."
3340,These guys hold the figurative key to the glacier. Worth the $ 10x over to get out there. Highly recommend!
3341,Salad bar is fresh and delicious. Nice fish sandwich too.
3342,Wash your car here
3343,Interesting store
3344,Rooms smelled of cigarettes. First room ac didnt work. When shaking out blankets in new room found a banking receipt in between the sheet and blanket from 2013 for someone else. Will not stay again. Many more things were dirty and gross. Toilet seat very low.
3345,Absolutely love this place. The wide variety of classes is fantastic. My boy is doing very well.
3346,This is the only nail salon I can find that does SNS powder in Anchorage and I love it! They do a great job and I think they are very friendly‚ù§Ô∏è

3356,Always good deals I always save when I shop here
3357,If its a new movie get there early
3358,Not kid friendly
3359,"This place has been more disappointing the second time we visited. Don't get me wrong it was disappointing the first time but it just got way worse when we thought a 2nd chance was in order, that was our mistake. We love the wait staffs at most place as we've been waiters/witnesses before, but they suck. We like to sit at the bar in most casual restaurants because they won't sit children in those sections (and children are f#&king terrible). But this shi##y place let 3 dumb bimbos walk in with their nasty little toddlers after 9 pm and sit in the bar. Just because those idiots couldn't find a babysitter or use protection doesn't mean everyone wants to here their shi##y little kids cry .  .  . that's a Gallos problem and a problem for dumb bimbos everywhere. Really poor experience, the food is not great and it's a pretty crappy place.

casual"
3360,Good bargains
3361,Beautiful scenery. Spotted a bald eagle.
3362,Fun place to go even during pandemic.
3363,"Awesome service, always willing to help their customers. Good selection of pretty much everything. I get 90% of my blu rays from here."
3364,The food excellent here

3366,I used to go here every day with my friends great place to go for some snacks!
3367,Very professional and great customer service
3368,Limited menu done right. With daily specials that are always awesome. One of my favorite places. Great beer and food with always friendly sevice

3371,Bought a nice 50% off accessory there. Lots to choose from
3372,Nice place
3373,Love this place... my husband I usually get one al a cart meal and split it because it's just to much for 1...
3374,Every one loves this place. Great for a meetup or to grab some coffee.
3375,Staff very friendly and quick orders.
3376,"Billy is a TOTAL sweetheart- a very cozy place to be, definitely a place I'd recommend."
3377,Love this place!
3378,Waitress was helpful. The food.. I ordered a salad and soup - (clam chowder). Just potatoes not any clams in it.
3379,It's not the Bentley Mall...or any mall at all... but Sentry usually has what I need to finish projects without having to drive to town.
3380,Kids had a blast. Good for all ages
3381,"The name Fast Food is a misnomer.  The food does arrive in a reasonable amount of time, but unlike fast food, the quality is very good."
3382,always great highly recommend prices are reasonable people are wonderful wish I could do 6 stars
3383,Amazing! First visit to an Air Force DFAC and it did not disappoint. Now if only Marine Corp chow halls could be this good.
3384,Great food for a great price.

3389,Great service
3390,I love Verizon and their services
3391,"Used to be a very nice place to grab some good Mexican cuisine, but Taco Bell is definitely better. Local Taco King in Anchorage have great Mexican cuisine."
3392,Fast and good service. Hearty portions made with care. Great lunch spot and solid salad bar.
3393,"These guys are great on the customer service end, if only they could step up the network coverage game."
3394,Great coffee and fast friendly service.
3395,Love the homie environment and pleasant staff
3396,Consistently pleasing
3397,"Excellent food and fun, hip, bustling atmostphere. Pizza was in my top 5 of any in the U.S.   Lots of brews to choose. Always busy and usually has a wait, but it is worth the wait. Carry-out available. It was so fun we had to get t-shirts. They offered many cool designs. The whole family enjoyed the experience."
3398,Boardwalk over a creek with tourists shops selling Alaskan stuff. Nice walk.
3399,"What can I say? It's Fred Meyer's, decent prices, good inventory and great people. My only complaint is they never make enough sushi, so by the time I get off work it can be slim pickings."
3400,Poor customer service and ignored all my simple requests for my sandwich. Highly unnecessary to act that way to someone just trying to get what they wanted when I was the only customer ordering.
3401,Good price.
3402,Everything was fine until the parking lot was full because they let an rv park in the lot. Bs
3403,Great gear n supplies
3404,"The server was very accommodating, attentive and respectful. I was torn between two pasta dishes and chicken Marsala, I chose the Marsala. It was tender, tasty and of good portion. The pasta on the side was also very delicious, however, I think that it may have gone a bit better with the chicken Marsala if it was served with a garlicky olive oil based sauce. If there was 4-3/4 stars, I would have given it that rating.I thoroughly enjoyed my solo-business trip dinner.I recommend this place"
3405,Best place for Ice Dogs hockey and beer
3406,Good standard pizza at good prices. Nothing to truly make it stand out.
3407,Spot on with a great vibrant menu and drink selection.
3408,Seems to be a good store some employees are iffy other than that it's got what you need
3409,I think it is important for keeping people alive. When they may not have anyplace else to go.
3410,Excellent food and great service!!!
3411,Clean and friendly
3412,I moved up from the lower 48 and shipped my stuff via barge. Everything arrived as I had packed it. The employee working the forklift was even kind enough to hand me boxes while I loaded my trailer. Happy customer.
3413,Good selection of shoes and shoe products. Prices are good.
3414,Love the online shopping
3415,"I never had such a good fish dinner.
King crab, rock fish, halibut, shrimps, clams and scampi in a tomato, fennel sauce.
Friendly staff, perfect vacation evening.
My husband had a steak, it was wonderful as well, nice athmosphere."
3416,Delicious. But not worth a 13 dollar meal. Buffet prices for a taste...
3417,Amazing selection
3418,"Extremely expensive for the size of the burger you get, however, its so delicious.  Usually get A1, some onions on the burger and a side of onion rings.  My mouth is watering thinking about it now."
3419,"Food was okay, service kinda sucked. It's hit or miss with the service, but the food is okay."
3420,Awesome place üëçüëçüëç
3421,"If you're visiting Anchorage and you want some delicious food, This is the place. I love ordering for the Hula Hands on Fireweed. My favorite is the Pulehu chicken and Chicken katsu. The upside down pineapple cake is a MUST TRY!!"
3422,Very delicious. Best fries in town and the Aloha burger was yummy.
3423,"Hot mess, half shack, with the fried okra - its a winner!"
3424,Service was great. Food very subpar. Not return
3425,"I only shop at Torrid and Zales, so I can't tell you anything about the other stores. The ladies in these stores are always cheerful and very helpful. Only four stars for the mall because I think it's the only mall in America that doesn't have an Auntie Ann's. üòÅ Always more fun shopping with a hot pretzel and lemonade. üòÅ"
3426,Excellent food an service
3427,Great food!
3428,Excellent breakfast sandwiches with friendly service.
3429,Good prices on EVERYTHING!
3430,Wonderful and informative place to visit.  The staff members are always very friendly and knowledgeable
3431,Great sandwiches and salads. Best in town by far

3434,Floors were dirty but food was good
3435,Always great!
3436,Great food in tikahtnu
3437,"Very good food, great price.  I'd like to see some spicy options...then 5 stars"
3438,This is a way cool hardware store! It's not just a hardware store. It's an everything store! One could spend hours just looking around. Well worth checking this place out just for fun!
3439,Quiet and not too crowded.
3440,I got great service and the person at the gun counter was very informative in helping me choose the right firearm for me.
3441,Alaska state fair was lots of fun.  Love looking at all the art shops and food places. Wish we had found the Helialaska helicopter rides earlier so we could have done that from the fair.  But there was a lot to see. And can't beat the view with Mountains in the back ground.  Make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes.
3442,"Went formals and Tails, great event and very good food. Try the mushroom soup."
3443,The wait in line was caused by computer issues. But otherwise it was a blast watching the young ones have such a great time. If you fit into the go carts your in for a treet. We will go back. If your going to have a groop go in before and check out what you need to do before going in.
3444,"Been there couple times, hands down one of my a time favs. The fireweed tea is the best."
3445,I really want to like this place because they have one of the most family friendly menus...but they ALWAYS get my order wrong without fail.
3446,"Things to order that are pretty tasty would be their Siu Mai, pork and crabmeat steamed dumplings; Onion pancake is decent.  Teramisu is a nice dessert.

I used to love one of their weekday lunch special dishes, halibut and ask for mild.  But the half a dozen times or longer, they now overcooked the halibut, before it was moist.

I kept complaining about it, but the cook keeps overcooking it.  I've stopped going there.  Maybe they changed the cook as it used to be better.  Not recommended I'm afraid."
3447,"Great place to take the family, engaging and friendly staff and you get to see reindeer and moose up close!"
3448,Best strombolis in Anchorage. Customer service a bit hit or miss. Very little ambiance. But did I mention that they make the best stromboli in Anchorage?
3449,Everything I have tried so far (which is quite a bit...) on the menu is fantastic! My favorites are the Singapore Meifun (ask for it spicy!) and the Black Jack roll. Great service always as well. This is the place to go in Alaska for amazing sushi and Japanese cuisine.
3450,Loved everything about Three Bears!
3451,"Newest park on Muldoon (that I know of). Very cute, new-age, and fun for all ages. Open year round and in the winter has an awesome skating track around the outside of the playground!"
3452,Been my choice for many years on special occasions/party's
3453,A little expensive for the quality of food
3454,Great service
3455,Fun place but expensive.
3456,"Awesome as always and great views. Waite staff is the best in Anchorage and the food is superb,  a little pricey but it's a hotel in touristville. I have gone there since the 80's and it is always great."
3457,Great customer service
3458,"Staff is friendly and the food is great!
Atmosphere is laid back and casual.
Great place to chill and catch a game on TV while having a few drinks with friends!"
3459,"You gotta watch this guy carve with a ""chain saw""....amazzzing"
3460,"Good vegan lunch options, unfortunately vegan breakfast options weren't quite as exciting. Friendly service and fun outdoor seating with a personal backyard feel."
3461,Needs parking directions in the back sometimes you can‚Äôt get through. No ramp or elevator for handicapped people and difficult to move heavy objects up and down stairs.
3462,I love their weed selection its really nice
3463,"Excellent food and wonderful customer service. Large portions for great prices with quality food. I‚Äôve enjoyed everything I‚Äôve ordered here and the server is so friendly and on top of everything. Parking at the restaurant is limited but I am always able to find free, street parking nearby."
3464,"Walking in I immediately appreciate the over all aesthetic. It feels open yet warm and welcoming. However the open space provides no sound buffer, so the dining room gets very noisey and it feels chaotic.  Because of that this is not a spot we could come for date night. I understand nothing can be done about it, but it's good to be aware of.
Now, the food....
We ordered fried zucchini, corn fritters, halibut tacos, and a bison burger.
Zucchini needed seasoning and tasted like it was cooked in the same oil as fish. Not overwhelmingly so, but noticeable enough. The sauce it comes with is good though, and they were cooked well. Nice n crispy crunchy!
Corn fritters were very good. Get them.
If you're concerned about the portions of the fish n chips get the halibut tacos. Very good portion size. I like the over all simplicity of the dish because you can taste each of the ingredients. However, same song as before in that the fish needed seasoning. Mine were also searved without the aioli which I didn't realize untill I was done with one. It def needs it. But the fish was cooked perfectly.
The burger was under seasoned as well. There wasn't much about it to stamd out as a good burger.
Oh and the fries! Reg fries are ok. I don't like most fries but wouldn't mind eating these. The sweet potato fries are good! Seems like they're battered and are a good texture. Both were seasoned well.
Over all the place feels new with all it's quirks, my partner wont return because of the noise but I will be willing to, and while we appreciate a low sodium meal the kitchen needs to up the seasoning a bit. Not just with salt, but flavor in general. I recommend 6 cloves of garlic in everything."
3465,Service is always great here
3466,"it was okay. their food is good and all but they should serve their food actually hot. I wasted 7 dollars on a peanut butter brownie and a rice krispy treat just for them to have an old, stale taste."
3467,Always changing. Eclectic mix of repurposed and upcycled house goods. Clothing vintage. Coffee shop. Good cause.
3468,Nice to have it all in one place.
3469,Really pretty church on the bank of the river.
3470,Great service and a beautiful store. Prices were about what you would expect.
3471,Service was good.  The food was mediocore at best.  They need to get rid of the frozen and pre-packaged food and start to really cook. It is bad when I think the Humpy's in the airport destroys the one downtown.
3472,"D&B is an amazingly fun place for all ages, fun for just going and watching what ever sports game is on and enjoying a beer."
3473,Awesome food...great service.....nice atmosphere......overall one of my favorites
3474,"Helpful staff, extremely knowledgeable about gun safes and fireproof boxes"
3475,Place is not cleaned enough. Air is moisturized but smells like death.
3476,We went to the one by Carr's off Dimond. It was quarter till 10 and the served us with a smile üòÉ it was really nice to sit at a restaurant
3477,Quality wash at a reasonable price. Lots of selection. Fully automatic.
3478,It's a ine stop shop if you need it.
3479,Very good salad. Food was brought very quickly.
3480,Pizza is outstanding
3481,Great place to grab a quick cup
3482,Always great grub great place great atmosphere
3483,"Good, local, helpful."
3484,Great food and service
3485,"I love this coffee hut. They have so many options available and healthy ones too. Their fruit smoothies are delicious, using fresh fruit and protein powder (if requested). The girls that work there are extremely friendly and provide the best service. I would recommend Fitspresso any day!"
3486,It was good
3487,Great furniture for good price
3488,Always take care of me and my car!!
3489,"My wife and I had lovely anniversary dinner here and it was amazing. The service, wine, food, ambiance, everything was great. I would definitely go back"
3490,"Great burgers. The fries are hit and miss. Most of the time, they're really good! Last night, a disappointment. Friends had the vegan burger and she was wildly excited about it. Sounds like she'd give it 5 stars."
3491,Great rooms great environment very friendly employees clean room but so many people asking could you let me in they need a security guard in the hallways
3492,Employees helped me find what I needed. I had a very good quick trip to the store.
3493,"Best pizza place around. Cool, laid back atmosphere.. and with it being newer-ish, not very crowded yet, but I'm sure that will change in the future.
Pizza is made right in front of you with a bunch of types of pizzas. The first time I got the smoked and spicy supreme, which was fantastic with the meats and veggies. The second time I got the roasted peppers which had a unique sauce that was delicious. This is definitely the place to go to for pizza. üëç"
3494,Good food and service.   Friendly staff
3495,Yummy pizza
3496,"Awesome salon!  I love the lady's they are nice and do a wonderful job?
Thank you Nit, Pang, and Patti"
3497,Great seafood
3498,The food is nasty
3499,Pretty good. Love the soups and the pastas are perfectly cheesy.
3500,"I live in Seward, AK and they drove down and cleaned my carpets and they did a great job. It would have taken me half a day to get done what they did in an hour. Price was great as well. Their van is equipped with water and a waste tank so no using the water in the house or dumping in my septic."
3501,Seem more interested in selling alcohol than quality food.
3502,I like how it's hidden in the back there in the woods
3503,Great appetizers and hot cocktails.
3504,Good food and service!
3505,Alaska Tire quickly found the reason for our leaking tire and fixed it. We are very happy with their service.
3506,Amazing deals and friendly environment.  Also free ice cream
3507,This food satisfies. You will probably feel less healthy after eating here.
3508,Your average automatic carwash.
3509,Always the finest in  quality and service.. lavalles does not disappoint. Succulent dishes. Alaskan cuisine as delectable as any dish you have had anywhere in our great land. Enjoy a great selection of fine wine and spirits served up with pride!! Great atmosphere..awesome alaskan beer selection. You cant miss a stop at lavalle's during your time in Fairbanks. Be sure to reserve as it gets really busy during travel season.. Cheers üòÅ

3517,"I don't recall ever having a more pleasant drive through experience.
Wendy's in North Pole Alaska!"
3518,Nice place to Go and see some of the wildlife.
3519,"They helped out a lot for it to be a ""self service"" place. I would definitely go back if it is for something simple."
3520,who can pass up the new moon shine berger. there is no one else In town who sells a berger that good. the staff is fast and friendly as well.
3521,The chalet is a decent spot for events.
3522,Super nice and people

3528,Standing in line for a long time and then a girl comes out and says that they are out of rice.  How does l and l run out of rice. Lost allot of business today. There is a food store very close. Ok i went back today to give this spot 1 more chance tried to order bbq mix plate. They were out of chicken today. 12/15/18
3529,"This time my husband and I went to see TAG. It was a Sunday so, hoping to catch a matinee, we were shocked at how busy they were. (Incredibles II was playing)
Considering how jam packed with children they were, the employees managed to keep smiles on their faces while prepping our concessions.
We were relieved to find our theatre wasn't full.
The seating is great. Both arm rests lift up. Nice slant so you aren't staring at the back of someone's head and wheel chair accessible seats which are, frankly, the best seats in the house. Smack in the center with seats for anyone accompanying them."
3530,You get your own bay and tools box. What more could you want. They have a press and tire machine on site to get things done and they have the parts house numbers on the wall to source things locally as well have a small selection of necessities like zipties and clamps.
3531,I love the food. I go here to lunch and / or dinner. Great stop for an outing with friends.
3532,Excellent service
3533,"(Translated by Google) Very funny

3534,"Ordered Chicken Avacado Salad and medium iced tea.  $15.  The tea tasted like lipton instant.   The salad came in a fresh, crispy shell bowl.  Very good.  Fresh lettuce, tiny bit of grated cheese and half an avacado, sliced.  Had pieces of chicken, which were on the dry side and had no real flavor.  The mild salsa also has no real flavor either.  No mexican seasonings that I could taste.  I would have liked a lot more grated cheese to help with flavor.  And olives may have helped.
Be sure to ask for your sauces when you order.  I won't order it again just because it was so plain.  But it was fresh."

This Subway was recently remodeled and it looks really cool, so come inside!  The service was quick and the food tasted great.  Strangely the address on their receipts is incorrect; the address is not ""3401"", but rather ""3104"".

3537,"It is a great little place. A nice location and they do a great job of rehabilitating. You get the feeling that the center exists primarily to help the animals which is very refreshing compared to some zoos and aquariums. Not many animals, but the ones they do have are done very well. There is a touch tank as well. There was a baby walrus there which was very cute. There are not many walruses in captivity so it was cool to see one up close, especially a 6 week old baby ciddling with the human who was feeding it."
3538,"Tried a new dish, forgot the name, but seasoned ground chicken with green oniona, lemon grass and jullienne onions. Delicious DEFINITELY eat there again! And again!"
3539,Not bad for a little ski slope.  Great for beginners.
3540,Been coming here since the early 80s and always feel at home - never disappoints!
3541,Great food and homey personable place and fair prices
3542,A fun little place
3543,I love this pizza! Super fast and friendly service and great prices!.
3544,"The store may look quaint from the outside, but they are quite well stocked, and have the lowest prices I've seen in the area. The manager knows how to get you what you want if you need a specialty order, and didn't try to BS me about my order time/cost."
3545,"(Translated by Google) Coffee and some drinks should be offered.

3546,Good pie
3547,"Probably the worst subway in Anchorage. The sandwich artists can be sloppy and the quality is subpar. That said, there's a couple guys that work here that have a fun rapport that brightens the experience a bit."
3548,Wow.  Cool.  Not very much wildlife.
3549,I would stay there again!
3550,The wash can be fairly inconsistent. Better than others in town and the unlimited washes is a plus. Machines could do a better job at washing thats for sure. Free vacuums are a nice feature.
3551,"Anytime I go here the staff are more than pleasant. And, they are also very knowledgeable in the department that they are specifically assigned to. I can't how many times a sales associate helped me to correctly size myself for boots, or any other type of outdoorsman style clothing. Always look forward to going here!"
3552,"Great food, friendly service, nice atmosphere"
3553,Had a good time
3554,Good
3555,Great Savings
3556,Shawn did an amazing job on my brakes and oil change. When I got in the car it felt brand new again ! Shawn was very transparent and kept me up to date on what he was doing with my vehicle. Aside from the work he was very nice and professional. 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend !
3557,Super affordable and the time for the money is awesome
3558,It always gets the full rear window on my vehicle. No other automatic carwash in town I've tried does!
3559,I like this store and its products but I cannot deny that I find the clothing to be too expensive for my thrifty budget.
3560,Nice frendley and comfortable
3561,Clean and quiet mall to enjoy walking around or enjoy a cup of coffee.
3562,Great place for people to wall away from traffic
3563,Very knowledgeable staff. They got everything for growing anything.
3564,I love this place! Their burgers and fries are so good. Plus the prices are comparable to any fast food around. There is a wait since they make your food to order (20 mins) but you can call ahead.
3565,Ever since Jackson started working I avoid this place otherwise it's great. Jackson gets 0 stars and gas n go gets 4.5 bringing it to 3
3566,The workers are very helpful and knowledgeable.
3567,"For the phone options, can‚Äôt speak with a real person to save your life."

3570,"Cars , washes, you name itüòéüëç!"
3571,Can never beat a beef hot dog and drink for 1.50.
3572,It's a great place for lunch or dinner.
3573,Good gas
3574,"The first time I was here it was great.  The second time not as good.  I had to tell the stylist to wash my hair, she was going to cut it dry.  Once we got past that it was good, the first cut was a lot better then the second one.  But for the price, it‚Äôs a decent place for a haircut."
3575,"Overworked staff, not enough staff. They try hard. Very difficult considering this can be a high volume location."
3576,God old Wallys cheap easy and always open. We like to go here late at night and horse around looking for new cheap movies and other things
3577,"Beautiful scenery, great service!"

If you're looking for the BEST sushi restaurant in Anchorage then you need to visit Sushi & Sushi.

Remember when Sushi & Sushi was just a small sushi restaurant?  Well now they're much larger and their food is even better!  Sushi & Sushi has a bar, sushi bar, tables, booths, and private rooms.  Their menu should have something for everyone including kids.  I suggest anything with spicy tuna.

3582,They always get my order right and the workers are always friendly.
3583,"A good resort at Denali national park well maintained rooms with shuttle service from main block  with good restaurant and gift stores, Starbucks coffee shop etc"
3584,"Bleh. They're literally there to only sell you new phones and accessories. If you need help troubleshooting don't bother, they aren't trained. You're better off using YouTube as your source of helpas the staff informed me they are only trained by watching videos, nothing more.  And they're really only trained to use an iPhone and nothing else. So if you need help with your pixel or your Android you better find someone else to help you."
3585,Great Service... Go there for all my tire needs
3586,"Great burgers, well made."
3587,"A great spot for good Halibut and beer. The atmosphere is dated, but provides a local experience - and crowd. We always make it a point to stop in when we're in town."
3588,Great place for auto repair!!!!
3589,Good place for breakfast or a burger if you are anywhere near the airport!
3590,"This train depot dates back to the original colonists' arrivals to the Matanuska Valley during the 1930s. It's a City of Palmer historic landmark. Rarely used anymore for its original purpose, it is now Palmer's community center.

I just attended a middle school graduation for a granddaughter here. Recent upgrades and renovations have taken away from it's historic ambiance, but were much-needed. While I sorta miss that the flooring doesn't creak and moan anymore and the old feel of the depot was sacrificed for sake of modernity and functionality, the graduation went well, in part thanks to the improvements.

The exterior of the depot remains original and is worth a look if you're in Palmer town."
3591,Its just fast foods.
3592,"Delicious! Always fresh and hot, service is good. Love me some orange chicken and chow mein üòã"
3593,Always dirty restrooms
3594,"My wife and daughter love to bring the dogs here, house pet or working dogs doesn't matter."
3595,It could have been better. There wasn't anyone around to answer questions. I guess that's why it's free
3596,"If it's odd stuff you are looking for that's for pets, nine times out of ten they will have it."
3597,Outstanding
3598,Great place to ski
3599,Good pizza
3600,"It's ok, convenient,  but not as great as other stores"
3601,Good service
3602,They said the aids test takes 20 minutes. They give you clean needles. Lubricant condoms
3603,The lady taken our order was new and took forever. They got my wife's iced coffee with cream but very little cream in it. She took the whip cream out of my drink to flavor it some. My frappe was supposed to be raspberry white chocolate but it had no color to it and the girl said she put it in when I tried it it was all white chocolate flavoring. Want be back there the only reason I didn't get my money back was we used a gift card so it was free and the line got long. One üåü is a stretch in my opinion.
3604,Okay to grab a quick snack
3605,"Good place for collect information, and have a small area for show Alaskan habits and history.. Very nice, kind and helpfull people here."
3606,Nice forest
3607,Excellent
3608,"If Jack Kerouac were alive today he'd be wandering around the Chugach high on life and whatever else he could get his hands on. He'd likely be drunk, too. But one thing he'd figure out quickly is that while you can't fall off a mountain you can sure as hell  fall down one and end up needing to be rescued by the Chugach Park rangers who need a lot more funding than our stingy legislature is willing to give them."
3609,They have the best paninis on the Peninsula
3610,I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the service. They are good with oil changes but service was never very friendly. Super expensive as well. I never got the problem fixed and walked away unsatisfied.
3611,Usually clean and never a line surprisingly!
3612,Nice place. Yummy food
3613,"Staff wasn't very knowledgeable and did an alignment on my car without doing a complete inspection first. Alignment was still off when I left shop and found that my control arm bushings where bad. They did get me a refund over the phone but then the lady behind the counter was rude about it. She also seemed to barely speak English, which makes it very difficult to give good customer service. 2 stars just because I was able to get a refund. Lost 4 hours of my life however"
3614,Snobby staff
3615,"Asked for the barbecue bacon burger  forgot name,, except as lettuce wrap for pickup got no barbecue sauce or pickle was no flavor too many onions ended up sick later not sure why maybe excessive onion maybe not"

3621,"Great beer, good food"
3622,Easy and they always have good prices and good gas.

3626,Great place for ice cream! A great way to cool on on those hot summer nights!
3627,"Fresh and good food.
Fantastic service."
3628,It's alright
3629,"Best pho in town! Absolutely love the steak pho!
Staff is always nice!"
3630,Great place to fit in and stay out of trouble.
3631,All I learned from my visit is that if you are a veteran and have the audacity to ask if they offer a discount you will be given a blatantly rude response. I can tolerate alot of short comings in service but I can't help but wonder if it is Starbucks policy to hate our servicemen and women. I caution service members and veterans to avoid this store.
3632,Pretty good place to shop.
3633,One of my favorite places to eat! Plates are huge! Worth the money and very yummy.
3634,Knowledgeable and personable  people work here. The atmosphere  and aura is amazing. The coffee and snacks are good too
3635,Good food and good service.

3638,Good fresh made to order!
3639,"These people saved my dog, sewed him up well"
3640,"Blueberries, sledding, sightseeing, etc. Awesome"
3641,By far the best restaurant in Homer!! It's a great place for dining out or picking up a huge slice of you're passing through and want a good and tasty deal.
3642,"All the ladies are great"" But Lee is their super star‚≠ê she makes me feel wonderfulüß°"
3643,Great food with local meat when possible. Great selection of beer too. Get the beet pizza.
3644,"Fantastic restuarant! The food was filling, great fresh tastes and good service! The place has a homer local feel and all employees looked happy and chilled with a sense of urgency for ours and everyone's needs."

3647,Incredibly good sticky buns.
3648,"Decent food, service is meh."
3649,Nice bar and nice people! Wish they would accept credit cards or 5 stars ;)
3650,"Grocery store with lots of other stuff. Only draw back is the prices are crazy high, but that is everywhere in Alaska!"
3651,Interesting family farm. Enjoyed the close moose encounter.
3652,"Good prices and they will bend over backwards to help you get what you need for the job, and if they don't have it they will send you to the store that does."
3653,Awesome.  Huge portions great flovor
3654,Not your average bar food. Great service.
3655,"Good food, friendly service."
3656,"Nothing special. Typical quick serve coffeehouse. The service was ok. Tjey do have lots of vegan, gf, organic options and a decent juice/smoothie bar. The kids turkey sandwich was huge and good. The quiche was not that great, tasted microwaved and had lunch meat turkey which is not my fave. I might come back for breakfast that menu looks better than lunch menu which was onpynhalf available when we came at 11:10. Breakfast was over at 11 but a portion fornthe lunch menu isn't available until noon. Which is annoying and confusing."
3657,My husband absolutely loves their spicy pork! I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbob and it was filling and delightful!
3658,The food & service was excellent. The best French Dip I've had in ages and the sweet potato fries were crispy and delicious.
3659,This is where a picture is worth a thousand Santas.
3660,Its alright
3661,"food is great, service was fair, 2 guys running it can't keep up the pace when busy most of the time..wi-Fi poor. good coffee, when you get it, just don't be in a hurry."
3662,Yummy
3663,Took 10mins to get menus another 5 for iced tea. 3 waitresses standing behind the bar talking. After another 15mins without anyone coming to take our order we went to the hostest station and paid. We are a mixed race couple and feel this could've been a factor.
3664,"My daughter and I were able to do a walk-in, quick and kind service."
3665,Great lunch and pleasant dining area. The wait staff is fantastic and the food is top quality. A bonus is the fact it wasn't crowded during the lunch hour!
3666,I enjoy the Joann Fabric/Craft supply store at Northway Mall the store has a huge amount of options that often I leave without what I needed but stocked up in fresh ideas. The staff is eager to help and the customer service is awesome.
3667,We checked in late so there was only a security guard on duty.  he was unable to give us a new room which I requested immediately because our smelled like a fish had been left there a week.  The next day we were moved to a room that smelled strongly of Curry.  Worst three nights ever.  Across the street is a scary-looking trailer park.  And it's also in the flight path of the airport.  but yes it's the cheapest thing in Anchorage where you don't have to share a bathroom.
3668,Mac Jr is a Yummy.
3669,I have to say for as high as the employees seem this taco bells food is always good. They almost always get 1 item wrong but I wont hold that against them under the circumstances. Love the random outbursts and singing...and of course the 80s shades inside. Go in ready for an entertaining time.
3670,"Every one I talked to was very friendly and helpful. Was able to add another vehicle over the phone, no problems. Thank you"
3671,They keep stuff safe for you!
3672,Favorite place to stay on the Kenai
3673,I really enjoy their steak. It's always cooked to perfection as ordered. Haven't had a bad meal there.
3674,The staff was friendly and helpful!
3675,"Gift shop, game processing, retail reindeer sausage, gift pack, one stop shopping"
3676,Have to do estimate and appointments online.
3677,I reccomend the seafood burrito its awesome.
3678,"Make the trip, it's worth every penny!"
3679,Very clean and helpful staff
3680,Do not go here if you actually lift. There are no barbells. Also the only way to cancel is by wasting time showing up in person or sending a certified mail cancelation.
3681,It is an awesome Burger
3682,Always love Wallie world.
3683,"Quiet, lots of TVs. Good drink and food specials."
3684,Good food
3685,"Much smaller than I expected, but informative displays."
3686,Needs more lanes open. Its packed with only 1 line open everytime I go in.
3687,The movies are movies that done in big theaters. So if you missed a movie after it's done premiering. It's a great place to watch a movie if you still want to see it on the big screen. And the food there fantastic! Absolutely fantastic!
3688,"Good atmosphere, little dingy and not what I expected from the ratings it gets... Steak was presented in a mediocre way, tasted fine but nothing mind blowing.. (had the filet mignon), also the Carrot Cake desert was good but again poorly presented on the plate."
3689,"The only choice in Juneau for after hours eats. One item menu, but they slay it."
3690,These guys are real nice and filled my propane tank in a timely manner.
3691,Great place to shop
3692,Just about everything that you need.
3693,JOEL got his happy birthday Pizza! Bumble Bee is his favorite and always perfect! Also a plus we had enough points to get free pizza! A perfect lunch for a perfect birthday!!
3694,Location location location and great staff also
3695,Expecting a large invoice...sold me only what I needed
3696,"Ketchikan only pool fun for kids and adults! Wish it was not chlorine, but an 02 pool like ar Smothers."
3697,"It‚Äôs Costco, best return policy around"
3698,Its taco bell. What do you expect?
3699,Meh. It's a good store but staff and cleanliness is alright.
3700,solid
3701,"Was I absolutly blown away by food and atmosphere? Naw. BUT this place is really good. If the weather is nice you can sit outside by the creek. Beer on tap is always good, and the food goes just right with the beer. Also, one of the better places to catch up on sports or tv shows with friends."
3702,"Service was great,  beer was good.  Food was subpar. I ordered a pork tenderloin sandwich. It was waayyyy over cooked. I'd try something different here,  but the service makes it worth trying again."
3703,"At first I was not pleased with how long it took to check out or just get to one of the cashiers,  But the manager was great at helping me.  I love VS"
3704,Someone disinfect eomething. With all the people who go thru. Its filthy. Clean up
3705,Nice place with good food and great view.
3706,"I love this location above the others. I love Kroger. I love the selection of natural foods, and especially vegan foods. We vegans recommend to other vegan friends to go to Kroger for vegan groceries. A wide selection of dairy free products, meat replacements, bulk foods that are important in our diet like nutritional yeast. I just hope that the meatless chicken strips don't stop being carried here."
3707,"Food was good, service was excellent."
3708,Up scale dining with a view. The best food around with an experience to go with it.
3709,Costco is always awesome
3710,Good food
3711,"Huge, nice looking, clean store with the best selection of natural, health products than anywhere else in Anchorage, Alaska!"
3712,For the hard to find items
3713,Beautiful no matter the season
3714,"Everyone compares pizza here in the area to Moose's Tooth, so when comparing the two Moose's Tooth is better but the pizza here is great as well. I live the buffalo chicken calzone. And I love the cozy atmosphere."
3715,"""It's bigger on the inside!?"" Until you see the mirror. I like it more than Tommy's Burgers."
3716,"Was in and out..  With the new self check out , Safeway is definately top 3 shopping centers here in Juneau there is a wide variety of brand name products.. If you can't find it ask one of the employees.. There wisdom and there dedication to helping you is there main priority.. And they all do just that... Thank you Safeway staff and most of all the employees working the floor.."
3717,"We waited 60 MINUTES to be seated on a Friday! Our server was very nice, but the meal was not. My Ship Creek Benedict of smoked salmon cakes was very fishy and not very good. There was no smokiness, needed more hollandaise, and I put a lot of hot sauce to try to make it better, something I don't do. I was sorry to have ordered it. My husband's Wild Mushroom Omelet seemed to be made with regular mushrooms and the amount of garlic overpowered the experience. Also, he doesn't like garlic, so it ruined it for him, too. There was less tea than in a store-bought teabag in both of our cups, so they were very weak. Our favorite part of the meal was the sourdough bread (not really toasted, so not really Toast) with raspberry jam. Very disappointing and in no hurry to go back."
3718,"Terrible restaurant!! Waited 2 hours for delivery and was then told my order couldn't be delivered. They couldn't call me to tell me because they were too stupid to dial 907. I am now starving with no food to eat and I have an 11 month old I have to load up, drag out in the cold to go get food late at night."
3719,"Nicely remodeled. Clean, quiet room."
3720,Good selection
3721,Great food if you dine in. The delivery sure charge is worthless for soggy fries
3722,"Surprised by all the good ratings because this place did not live up to the hype. First of all it was a gorgeous day and they have a large deck area but ""it was closed and we were not allowed to sit out there today because there was no server"" and then inside there was no view of outside.... it really sucked. The soup was OK, salad was tiny, Grizzly cheese pizza (ordered with extra cheese - but would not have known it) was a huge disappointment. Crust was so tough that I could not even cut it with the knife for my youngest daughter. We had half a pizza left and did not get it to go it was so bad my kids were like no way am I eating any more of that. Would not recommend or come back next time we are around the area. So far the only poor review of our trip."
3723,"I got the daily special when I went, I think it was braised beef over cheese curds and fries. While it was good, the trip was somewhat disappointing as the online menu still has their bratwurst on it but they in fact do not sell it anymore."
3724,"Excellent service, good food and drinks."
3725,"Its North Pole, so be warned.  The inside is pretty beat up and not very grand.  They have a room for birthday parties, but it's so old and drab it looks like you're having a party in a prison. In the back they have a selection of old arcade games, and a great number of them dont work, or they're so old the screens are green and horrible.  Thrtes also electric go carts on the smallest track in the world.  The laser tag area is pretty small as well.  A few obstacles and ultraviolet lights try to mask how tiny it is.  If you're having a kids party for 4 year olds, probably not bad because they dont know any better.  The bathrooms are pretty dingy as well, we went for a party, were the only ones there, and the bathrooms garbage was over flowing with paper towels and other garbage.  I can't say this place is impressive, and for the price that's charged for a 5 minute game, I my opinion it's not worth it.  But, its economical.  If you go to the trampoline park you'll pay three times the amount.  Bottom line, I'm not a fan, and I think they would be more successful if they freshened the place up a bit,like expand the tag arena and update the arcades.  But people that dont know what a real laser tag area looks like wont know any better."
3726,Nazi prison camp status no guests of your own. Curfew oh you can have guests there only 25$
3727,"Your not coming for the faded faux Asian decorum that's for sure. The star of the show is the giant iron teppan and the skilled chefs making your selections into delicious meals. A show in and of itself, it's supported by a great buffet with options for the whole family. Come hungry and ready to eat with your mouth and eyes, just don't take too much. Finish the meal with some tasty soft serve ice cream too. Great fun."
3728,Very good service lot better then sportsman ware house for buying a gun
3729,Just about everything you want is there.
3730,"Nice airport. Good food and services. Easy in, Easy out"
3731,Biggest store without clothing...
3732,"We went here based on all of the positive feedback and awards. When we arrived at 10:30 AM we were told it would be over an hour wait. We decided since we had time to go ahead and wait. We went for a walk around while waiting. It ended up being about an hour and 15 minutes wait. Once we were seated we waited about 10 minutes to be waited on and another 30 before the food came. The waiter was very nice and took off the charge for the coffee (without any comment from us) due to noting the long wait for us to get our food. The food was great - I had the deadliest catch which included a crab Benedict and a salmon cake Benedict with a side of reindeer sausage. My wife had the crab Benedict. We both loved the food and the coffee was also quite good. Prices are a little high. this place would be so much better if they added some staff and put in a few more tables by removing some of the wasted space in the restaurant. I would recommend this place with the caveat that you need a lot of time, or put in a reservation as for us - breakfast ended up being lunch at about 1:30 by the time all was said and done."
3733,I could go broke there so many good things at great prices...
3734,"One of the best cuts I‚Äôve gotten in 38 years.  It doesn‚Äôt matter who you get, they are all good and pay attention to detail.  You get a great cut for a good price, can‚Äôt beat that."
3735,SO. MUCH. GOOD. SHTUFF to eat... Great pho with many goodies and the rolls are quite good. Worth a stop if you're around Dimond and Seward Hwy. Staff was very nice and friendly; restroom very clean!
3736,Enjoyed the smoked salmon pasta and the scallops!  The wait staff was friendly.
3737,Our favorite restaurant. Fresh and delicious food that leaves you feeling good and satisfied.
3738,Great place for a light hike.
3739,Great food. Decent price. And I am always full wben I am done. Service is great with all the small touches that make your meal enjoyable
3740,Refreshing ride. Quiet. Great venue to take visiting family and out of town folks.  Purchase tickets during advertised specials.  Expensive.
3741,"Everything tasted great! Good service. Authentic food. Mango cake was the best cake I've ever had! Could use some better decorating inside, could use some fresh paint."
3742,The burger and fish & chips are absolutely great!
3743,Was fast and friendly
3744,"Cars/safeway, usually has the foods stuffs you need in for stock.

The actual lanes are a bit small so social distancing can be fun.

Checkout lanes are hit and miss, its much easier to self checkout"
3745,"Beautiful park and fun play structures. Nice walkways, green space, and lake to enjoy as well."
3746,Best pies in alaska
3747,I really liked the vehicles here. They were all still like new and the price is unbeatable. If you're looking for a used vehicle I highly recommend checking this place out!! You'll never know what they have until you stop by to see for yourself üòÅüëç
3748,Beauty beyond belief
3749,First it stopped working right as I was supposed to go in and then the machine completely missed the bottom half of the sides of my car. Definitely not worth it!
3750,"Fast, great staff, prices a little high."
3751,Loved it.
3752,They store my liquor
3753,Excellent coffee! I had their special and my husband had a delicious white mocha. It was just the right amount of sweetness and temperature!
3754,Fast and organized
3755,Extremely challenging hike...well maintained pit toilets and a snack bar with coffee!
3756,"The grocery store / prices are  good , the one checkout line that takes 30 min EVER SINGLE TIME I visit is horrible and made me stop shopping there.

It wasn't like this before they were bought out by Albertsons"
3757,My first time here...staffs were really nice and helpful.
3758,Consistent. Good service.
3759,The lady's here are absolutely amazing super sweet and very helpful all ways
3760,Always has the parts I need
3761,Has almost everything my son liked to buy!
3762,"Rangers were very friendly and helpful.  Took a bus up to the sled dog kennels then walked back to the visitors center via the Rock Creek Trail.  Beautiful scenery, however it was not what I was expecting by the name and it went up and over then down a mountain - but hey it is Alaska and Denali so guess that should be expected. LOL Had a great time here and the trail was not busy at all."
3763,Cheap.  Good popcorn.  Audio listening devices.  Great service I love this place great for quiet date nights or movies with kids.
3764,"This is definitely the nicest Super 8 I have ever stayed in. They recently remodeled, so they have all new carpet, paint, bedding, closets, etc. Some items are still old like toilets, sinks, etc. The customer service was good. I had a problem with the cable in my first room, and they moved me no questions asked. I would stay here again."
3765,"Cheaper than most if you just want your nails simply painted, but I could have done a better job at home. Sloppy and rushed."
3766,The books I find to be neatly organized an the staff friendly.
3767,"(Translated by Google) No encheritos no go

3768,"Biggest fair in the State of Alaska located 50 miles or so from Anchorage in Palmer Alaska. Fun amusement rides and lots of fair food throughout the grounds. Very hard to decide which booth has my favorite food. Wandering minstrels and lots of booths to find new treasures or learn new skills. Hundreds and hundreds of entries in exhibitions. The enormous vegetables entered in competition each year just seem to get bigger and bigger. The giant vegetables are donated to the bears, musk ox and moose in the Wildlife farm in Turnagain. The carrots zucchinis and other vegetables are donated to local food charities to make soup."
3769,"Great food, great service"
3770,I refuse to give Walmart any of my hard earned earn money no matter how low they charge for the  inferior product that they sell.
3771,best vet in town
3772,"Average food, lengthy wait. Loud"
3773,"Conveniently located in downtown Juneau, this library is very popular with locals and tourists alike. It offers great views of Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, the harbor, Mount Juneau and surrounding mountains, as well as a kid-friendly section, free Wi-Fi (donations appreciated), newspapers, magazines, computers, and books. They also have a lovely outdoor balcony overlooking the Gastineau Channel where you can get some fresh air while you read."
3774,WAY LESS EXPENSIVE than Safelite.  Great customer service and very fast work. I used the Groupon to get some chips filled in before winter. The owner was nice and even filled in an extra chip for only $10 extra. I'll be coming back if I need more work done.
3775,Cold food
3776,Absolutely delicious! The service was awesome with smiles all around. The price is higher but worth every penny!!!
3777,Cute puppies and doggos
3778,Best food always

3780,had the chicken masala. it was so delicious. prices were ok. I'll go back for sure.
3781,Thanks
3782,Kids sure love it
3783,"Prices are higher than Wal-Mart just up the road, but the atmosphere is better, the fruit and veggie selection is better, and the wait to checkout is usually way shorter since there are more cashiers."
3784,"This store is super nice!! Great employee's. One of the managers need retraining, after I can upgrade to level 5."
3785,Seems ok
3786,"Food was good, service was excellent."
3787,Great customer service
3788,Lots of delicious food and fun local art.
3789,Good thai  food great service
3790,"A blast! Great for everyone! Easily monitor family activity with open views across park and easy access for crossing. Great slides and attractions, food court, lockers, changing rooms, life jackets and tubes available."
3791,They have live animals for sale and fish the Only place in Town
3792,"Best Hawaiian food I have had off the islands. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Anchorage. The service and staff are phenomenal. I would recommend this place to everyone who loves Hawaiian food or hasn't tried it yet. Get the poke, musubi, and laulau"
3793,Good prices rebates and customer service
3794,Small selection and poor location. Beware of the steep grade if looking to buy an RV... once you find the entrance.  Don't miss the turn or you'll be driving a significant distance to get another shot at it.
3795,"Long wait in the car. Very few employees.  Then I am told to call 611"" almost all issues can be resolved that way"", I was told. So if you need them, don't waste your time. Call 611!"
3796,Peaceful environment
3797,Great place to get everything you need for outdoor fun
3798,Great place
3799,"The staff is very friendly and food is great! The building does get a little crowded as it is kind of small, so large groups probably aren't suggested to try and eat inside, but the quality and portions of the food are perfect"
3800,For shipping
3801,"(Translated by Google) Excellent pizzeria

◊§◊ô◊¶◊®◊ô◊î ◊û◊¢◊ï◊ú◊î"
3802,Nice atmosphere. Always having events and contests and games to participate in.
3803,We had to wait for the food and the drinks for an hour. The food was good tho.
3804,My Son's Favorite is the 32oz. Creamsicle
3805,"Great food and atmosphere. Hint: if you get biscuits and gravy from the coffeehouse side, you can still order eggs from the restaurant side to go with them."
3806,Gas pumps still only take cash.
3807,Gewat price for the quality of food. I love the friendly staff at both locations.
3808,Terrible experience. Will never return. Please read all reviews on this place before booking. You will regret staying there.
3809,"They have almost everything, bought a puzzle yesterday.   Hardware. RV supplies.  Fishing gear.  Everything.  Excellent warm friendly helpful staff."
3810,Made me sick
3811,The couple who run the business is super nice.
3812,"I had some car issues while on vacation in Fairbanks , called a lot of garages and was in need of a thaw. 15 mins before closing these folks were able to take my vehicle in and thaw it out. From having traveled back and forth all over the west coast, also a lifelong Alaska resident. It is professionalism and people like this that set Alaska aside from the lower 48. And make it a beautiful place to live, with forever gratitude, thank you Kens Alignment."
3813,Great I had a seniors 55 meal and used arp the good was really good
3814,"The wait was too long the food was too expensive for the serving size and just plain. I understand the cover charge for the live music to pay the band. But the band was only so so ( played a lot of grateful dead) and they played on a balcony. I could watch them from the street.
Welcome to hope :-)"
3815,Beautiful in every direction you look. An awesome place to enjoy nature itself!
3816,"Came here for an oil change and mount and balance. They took good care of me and did a thorough job. I was actually in the bay while they did the oil change, so was able to watch the service. No attempts to upsell me.

The downside... $75 for an oil change. Just your standard 4-5 quarts of 5w30 conventional. Whoah! I already had my car in the bay and told them if they gave me a good deal on the mount and balance, it was all good. Mind you this was 10 degree weather, snowy, and my engine was piping hot. Not a day I would want to change my own oil.

End of the day, they unmounted 9 tires, mounted and balanced 5, and actually got the tire pressure right. Not one protest about mounting my used tires that were slightly off spec. Loaded my other wheels into the truck. Charged just $40 for dealing with my wheels/tires that were sitting outside frozen. Appreciate it guys!

Overall, nice staff and very good service. They did give me a good deal on the tire service. I cannot recommend a $70+ oil change, though."
3817,The food was not as pretty as it looks in the picture. Some things were great others not so great. Be picky.
3818,Great prices
3819,"The best sized dance floor in a Valley! Great variety of drinks, attentive servers,good bartenders ,bar games,pool tables.Local music  bands, music starts after 10pm.They also have different events,like dance lessons, concerts,painting parties,,karaoke, etc."
3820,Friendly
3821,"Service a little slow, but good food"
3822,"Called them about 2 doors for my truck they had listed online. Front one was listed for $250 and the back for $200.  Guy was very rude when i talked to him. Told me the front one was $500 and the rear was $400. I told him i seen them online for the price mentioned before. Said he didn't care, that's what he wants for them. So...whats the point of listing parts and prices online if your just going to argue about them? AVOID!"
3823,I travel hundreds of miles out of my way to get their halibut. Worth. Every. Mile.
3824,"Very expensive and muddy. Exit Glacier is a much better option and it's free. You don't get to ""walk"" on it, but the pathways are less slippery and not muddy. The drive to the gift shop was an adventure in itself. Staff was very friendly, but the glacier itself wasn't worth the money."
3825,"Great store, good prices and friendly staff."
3826,Always have loved the exchange since day one of my service. This one is just as good as the others with knew exception. The Gun section is probably one of the best that I have been to. The employees actually seem to like guns and selling them.
3827,"They did an awesome job hosting a raucous large graduation party for us. Excellent food with a genuine Mexican flair. Festive, lively atmosphere, and great service."
3828,Great sushi and desert was even better
3829,Very good
3830,"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is good.  That being said, I've only eaten their Mongolian Beef.  I've been there for lunch multiple times, and they're always quick to bring out the food, which is nice when I'm on my lunch break from work."
3831,Very good food.
3832,Great food very friendly staff. Service was Excellent. Best part is they have gluten free wraps.
3833,"Clean , consistent, server was pleasant."
3834,"Food was okay, but pricey. Beer is served in a small cup"
3835,There much more to do here than Denali Wilderness just as beautiful
3836,Awesome place for tourists. Amazing
3837,Cool place with all the information you need to educate yourself if you're a tourist.
3838,The smallest Safeway I've been in my entire life! Friendly staff.
3839,Alot of nice things
3840,"These folks are amazing! Our gym needed new handles for our battle ropes and nobody else would touch them! Rob didn't hesitate! Even though the job was way out of their normal scope, he told us he'd take care of it! There's been great communication and he's paid close attention to what we needed, even ordering special materials and testing them to make sure they'd hold up through the extensive use we're going to put them through! We don't even have a boat! The best type of people work here so go! If you go somewhere else you're going to miss out!"
3841,This place is where my wife goes to spend all her money. Makes her happy
3842,Assume
3843,Ordered a bun-less burger but with everything on it.  All I got was a patty.  Called them and they delivered most of it again but still missed items even after specifically listing it out for them.
3844,Everyone is wonderful and they care about you.
3845,"Food was great. The server was less than attentive,  but they were very busy with the take-out business they were doing. Lot's of hustle and bustle."
3846,Food is good and service usually too. Environment is loud and mixed drinks aren't very strong. Burgers are always good though and love the lettuce bun option!
3847,"Great food. Excellence service. Good time overall. The menu is nice and concise with good prices. If you want some nice food and a good eat, go here."
3848,Best in Anchorage if you want an authentic Japanese experience. They have season exclusive items and a variety of dishes for almost any type of craving.
3849,Not much going on there for good movies
3850,Super fun
3851,"Good view, location...Cdnt get much help"
3852,Great burger
3853,Good customer service and they have a lot of stuff you need.
3854,Joanns Jo-Ann's is my best yarn store and it's at the Nugget Mall
3855,Always friendly and decent price for what you get!
3856,Three Bears is one of the coolest stores! Wish we had one in Anchorage! THEY are like a cross between New Sagaia and Costco combined but smaller.üòÅ
3857,"Nice Palmer Hay Flats access spot to show young kids wetland/salmon habitat. The boardwalk allows easy foot travel along the sedgy Wasilla Creek bank that can flood in spring or be otherwise impassable. Recommend just walking, no dogs or toddler bikes."
3858,I got really sad but it was conducive. Hanging put at this chicks house
3859,Too many faker having to be there
3860,"Food is always hot with a long wait, but the place is always dirty. Can hardly ever find a place to sit without food on the table and chairs. Service is always stand off,"
3861,"Good drinks and bar food options, but the wait time to get a drink can be a while when it's packed and busy."
3862,NICE
3863,Place is nice
3864,Was good got a nice discount with my rewards and cat litter refills
3865,Inexpensive smoking goodies! fun to visit. Good staff.
3866,A great place for a day spent outside.
3867,A+
3868,Open during Quake Fridays.  Studs.  Now I'm ready for a royal rumble at Carrs for water.
3869,Misses the lanes.!!!
3870,"Quite little place with great Italian food. Interesting decor, polite and attentive servers. Should go for a nice dinning experience."
3871,The only way to Fly around SE Alaska !!
3872,Very helpful and kind salespeople.
3873,My go to place now Sam's club is closed
3874,I spend four nights there last week.  Very nice place.  The room that I was in was very small but everything in it seemed to be brand new.  The Red Lantern is a nice place for a drink after the conference.  The only issue that I had was with the bathroom fixtures.  I ended up having to take the toilet tank apart and fix the handle myself after listening to the toilet run for over an hour.  The hotel was 100% occupied for the nights that I was there so I'm sure the maintenance staff was pretty busy.
3875,Fantastic park near a great camp ground.
3876,"I go here probably more often than I should, the service is phenomenal and your food is always fast and delicious. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants simple, cheap and good food"
3877,This restaurant has really good food and really kind servers.
3878,Staff is friendly however this place is a bit crazy with so many kids running around.  Just about every gaming machine is a tokens to win tickets type setup for things that could probably be purchased for a lot less than the money spent on tokens however the kids had fun and the skeeball  brought back memories from when I was a kid.  There is a lunch option that I think might be to attract the work/lunch crowd during the week however I cannot see myself doing this.
3879,We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Marie was our server and she was awesome. She's on the ball. Food was amazing. My husband had the Halibut and fries. I had the chicken cobb salad which was huge and oh so delicious. We had the pretzel and Brussel sprouts for appetizers. The pretzel was huge and the sprouts were to die for. We highly recommend this place.
3880,"These guys do amazing work. They work surprisingly fast, and their customer service is top notch."
3881,Pretty good food and great customer service but horrible Bloody Marys all decent place to take a family if you want to have a good atmosphere and good customer service
3882,Best service and quality service anywhere around if you‚Äôre looking for a bike
3883,Bed bugs and roaches when I turn the lights off. Better if you keep lights on all night
3884,"Espresso drinks can be hit and miss depending who is working. Customer service in general is...meh. Staff seems like they are not happy to be there at all and sometimes act annoyed by guests and are on their phones a lot. Food choices are so close to being awesome, but just a bit lacking for the price. I know its outsourced but just a little extra love would make em great! Biscuit sandwich was good, yummy biscuit with sausage and cheese but the whole thing was super dry! Would love it with eggs and maybe some aoli, or gravy on the side. Also had a flaky pastry with cheese (sorry, dont remember specifics) and it was so yummy."
3885,Fast service and the food was good.
3886,The staff here were very nice and the Vet took care of our kitty Peaches. I will be returning here if needed.
3887,Lots of souvenirs crowded prices ok
3888,It's Subway what else is needed to be said.
3889,They should have a better service
3890,Love this place everything around in one area
3891,Staff was very friendly. They go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your visit. Half day trip was just the right amount of time for us and is beginner friendly. More experienced paddlers should go in a large group of similarly skilled paddlers to avoid being slowed down by newbies
3892,Great place they have everything.
3893,Possibly the friendliest Subway I've ever been to!  Great job Eagle River store
3894,Polite and courteous
3895,Best deals in town
3896,"I called asking simply for professional services to facilitate paying an inmate's bail. I had the means of paying cash or card. My issue was with getting the funds to the appropriate venue; was that the courthouse or the front desk of anchorage correctional complex or online bail posting even though cash only is detailed in the orders?

When I called fred's bail bonding, I was told that thet didn't like to do two hundred and fifty dollar bonds. They told me just to walk into the jail and pay it."
3897,Pricey but good food and wonderful ambience for an evening out.
3898,I like it here.
3899,"Hoping to rewrite this later, but was disappointed in the service. My husband had been by the lot and found a vehicle that he wanted me to test drive. He had talked with a salesperson prior to us returning.

When we got there we went to the vehicle we wanted to look at, sat there for a bit and no one came out. That was fine.

My husband went in and was told the salesperson he had spoken with was on the phone. He told the front receptionist that we would be waiting outside next to the vehicle when the salesperson became available.

While we waited he texted the salesperson and didn't get a reply. After approximately 30 minutes of waiting we left.

As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot the salesperson called. According to him the message about us waiting wasn't passed on to him. I had the same reason used by another salesperson when I had previously been inquiring about a vehicle on the lot.

Not sure if it's being used as an excuse or the reception isn't doing their job, either way service was lacking."
3900,Really good food! Love the little area the kids can roam. There's a little waterfall out back that the kids played near and had fun with. The little donuts we're super good and I liked my breakfast platter a lot. Had these seasoned heirloom colorful potatoes that were very good and the bacon was probably the best I've ever had. Highly recommend checking this place out!
3901,Really great customer service and always able to get in pretty quickly.
3902,"Good trails if you want an a
Activity to do within walking distance from the dock. Fair amount of up hill. Limited network access. Take comfortable shoes, water and some snacks."
3903,"OMG!  This place is amazing.  There's no doubt they put out more pizza than any other single location pizza joint.  Trust me, you'll want to stop in.  I suggest you order to go and pick it up.  This place always has a LONG wait time."
3904,Horrible service
3905,Very good homemade noodles wow. Amazing  find in Anchorage
3906,Everything you could imagine. A must visit kind of place.
3907,Burger was cold.
3908,Great sushi and bulgogi. This place was packed over the weekend at dinner time and for good reason! We had to wait about 10 minutes but it was worth it.
3909,Not only food for you. They also serve just  hamburger patties for your dogs!
3910,Sucker for a Dave's double....my kryptoniteüòÅ
3911,Its lowes. This store has people that actually try to help.

3919,Delicious food and great service! Had brunch. Reindeer Omelette and pancakes. Definitely will be back
3920,"Great variety and taste, but I have been to others with more selection. But everyone is gonna find something they like and it will taste quality. I don't know if it was just the time of day I went but the restrooms were not quite as clean as I would hope."
3921,Love Costco
3922,"Food was amazing! Kind staff with prompt service and good prices, especially for the portion sizes! This is definitely going to become one of my regular spots."
3923,"Saltwater pool, great exercise room.

3929,"Great selection of natural foods, health/beauty and home products"
3930,Ok for fast food
3931,Such an adorable store! The lady at the counter was very kind and helpful in deciding what I should order. I definitely will be back to try their bubble waffles.
3932,This is one of the better 2nd hand stores in Anchorage that I have been to so far.  Prices seem higher than I am used to from lower 48 however all 2nd hand stores here are a bit higher than ones from the lower 48 like everything else in Alaska.  We definitely come here to get some misc things from time to time.  Look online for the discount days that are on the calendar to save even more.
3933,Freindly service really helpful even when they didnt need to be
3934,Quick service and fast process.
3935,"Great food, great service (usually), and awesome prices.

3937,"Expensive for lunch, but nice atmosphere and attentive service."
3938,Great location! Kayaking on the lake is awesome.
3939,"Just a little hole in the wall, but don't let that scare you.  Their fried shrimp is AWESOME, as are their scallops.  They might have the best clam chowder in Anchorage."
3940,"One of my favorite hikes.  A good workout with a steady incline up, but not strenuous.  Not too long of a hike and very rewarding views.  Also some good berry picking along the trail."
3941,Great service!
3942,the most friendly with the best advice!
3943,This place is totally awesome.. Santa's house and Shop is huge. Left cards with Santa for him to write back.
3944,"Came here because my man loves their Chicken Lo Mien and the 2 Asian ladies stayed talking in the back and they knew I was standing there waiting, I was the only one there and they kept me waiting like 10 minutes they must not like business."
3945,"Absolutely delicious food at a great price point. This isn't one to miss, as they are serving up dishes that are unique to our food scene and delicious across-the-board (and the presentation is fantastic)! Our server was friendly, despite being new, and everyone in my group left raving about their meals.

I also loved the bloody Mary they fixed for me, it was spicy (always a positive trait in my book).

We will be returning soon."
3946,"Love it, great remodel and lots of fun"
3947,Delicious food at tourist prices.
3948,Very nice boat ramp.  Restrooms on site.
3949,Best Pho in Fairbanks!
3950,"The best Mongolian Beef in Anchorage. And at the end of the day, that is what I care about most in a Chinese restaurant! Speedy service on call in/pick up orders too!!!"
3951,Great inventory and variety. Definitely shopping again soon!
3952,Great experience every time me and my daughter had a blast with the VR system and the lazer maze the staff is amazing super kind

3956,All Bouldering with routes for all skill levels and age levels
3957,Best Tamales
3958,"Good food, minor error in the order, but our tummies were happy in the end."
3959,This place is outdated and not the safest place to be.
3960,Great trails and views. Must be wildlife conscious and carry necessary survival items.
3961,"A must do for all Alaskans and tourists alike.

Typically not too busy, off holiday. The hike is varied in its difficulty, but offers many alternative options to the inclines /declines...

The hand tram is a worthy experience (weight limit 400 Lbs.)"
3962,"I loved this store. Friendly, knowledgeable staff, easy parking. Durability friendly. Clean store. Bakery clerk went out of her way to help me find what I needed and at an excellent price. Definatly recommend this particular location."
3963,"Based on their current open carry stance, in THE LAST FRONTIER, we will no longer shop there with so many other options locally. We'll pay more elsewhere."
3964,Very lovely staff. Shout out tom.
3965,"Great food,  delicious beer and good environment"
3966,"Staff is great, PETCO is well just that. Nothing special but there isnt many other options."
3967,Being able to eat classic Bear's/Moose's Tooth pizza WHILE enjoying a movie with friends? Definitely a cool place.

3973,Slowest cashiers in Anchorage. No urgency at all even when there are 10+ people in line. This store needs self-checkout stations.
3974,Dope smoke shop. Can buy 1 gram of flower for yourself and smoke it on site. Along with consuming 10mg of THC on site to if I remember correctly. Other side of the store has a full shop but you can't smoke that stuff on site.

3999,Good food and friendly staff.  Seating area can hold a lot more than it looks like from the outside.

4002,"Absolutely delicious. Its reasonably priced, great service and friendly staff."
4003,"Worst place ever . Not welcoming and dirty
Floor needs cleaning. The barber was rude and she gave attitude when showed how low wanted the skin fade . Not even a hello and welcome in. Claim 30 years of barber . I think beauty school , not good with mens hair. Doesn't know what a fade is . She thinks a line around my head is a fade . Well go back to school . Never again you better of just shaving your whole head your self.  Go and learn a real fade from a real barber lady.  The whole experience the worst ever. 30 years right I've been getting faded for 45 so guess what I know what a fade looks like. Too bad ketchikan lacks good barbers ."

4017,"Don't get me wrong, usually I love Sleepy Dog.

The coffee isn't anything special, but that's Alaska. However, I do expect people who've been in the coffee business for ""28 years"" to know what a cortado is...

Luckily, they made up for it with rude jokes & overcharging me for calling them out on their BS :)

Very traditional service. Homely atmosphere‚Äîjust make sure not to talk to anyone."

They keep the hose in the garage and bring it out when you need it. Now that‚Äôs service! Be sure to fill up on gas to show your thanks."
4049,"Higher prices, but wide selection for glass, throw away vapes and other medicinal items"

4052,Found many things I like to snack on but haven't checked out the meat department yet.   The staff was very nice to me and one even helped me find a seasoning to use on porkbelly.

4064,Loved the pizza but be ready to wait a LONG time to get it.

4068,"Got waited on fast! Employees were friendly and food was hot and good, Restaurant was clean and bathrooms clean!"
4069,"Clean and nice, hard to enter for handicapped guest....."
4070,Good for so so service
4071,nice friendly staff
4072,"This review is down a star thanks to one store employee who feels it's his duty to convey his beliefs in a passive/aggressive conduct.  First, the store is in the middle of Healy, which is pretty much in the middle of nowhere.  So prices are going to be a lot higher.  This store has almost everything for the locale: a hardware store, outdoor supplies, convenience area, and groceries. But the main reason I wont  support them again is because the attendant at the outdoor section/gun counter did not agree with potential customers wearing protective masks during the era of COVID 19.  He might have been able to make a sale on a firearm that day, but instead let me know that I was not ""awake"" because of my choice.  I choose to wear a mask, it hurts no one else and doesn't infringe on anyone else's rights.  Why he, a clerk that may be knowledgable in firearms but is nothing more than a hourly-waged saleman, feels he needs to demean me for my choice is indicative of the attitude in this country.  So for that alone, I will from now on  stock up on my goods in Anchorage,  Telalkeetna, Fairbanks, Wasilla,  etc, to have plenty of items on hand to preclude using this store.  If I need to get gas, there's another gas station next to 49th State brewery and a Tesoro up the road.  But I wont stop to purchase anything here again.  It may be petty, but the great thing about being an American is I can choose where my money goes and whom to support.  It wont be this place."
4073,Awesome place üòâ...
4074,I mean ... better than mcdonalds worse than burgerking. Either way fast food.
4075,Lots of flat screens and pool tables. Band plays downstairs.
4076,Beauty
4077,"Prices are great, less than in Fairbanks, service could use some work....."
4078,Everyone was really nice and professional.
4079,Grew up in NJ and NY and this place is the closest thing I've ever found to a good Italian sub.  I'll stop in Everytime I pass this place even if I'm not hungry.
4080,Food was amazing and a ton of it. Place is kid friendly and I can't wait to go back.
4081,"Not a good idea to only have 1 entrance and exit for a place as big a Walmart. They say it is for covid... but wouldnt it make more sense to spread the people out a bit by opening the other entrances???

Other than that i have no issues."
4082,Over 10 visits always awesome. They're very fast with long drive thru line's
4083,Beautiful place mostly untouched by humans. Listen to your guide when they tell you to give moose a wide berth.
4084,Was amazing.
4085,Have always had good experiences with my care and my family care here.
4086,I love their food! The Hot BBQ Wings are my favorite.

4092,Picked up order becuz my daughter was sick
4093,"The room was very nice.  Since we had a Marriott rewards number we got a room high up with a great view.  They charge a lot for parking, wifi, even using computers in the business center.  The staff is friendly, professional, and helpful.  The location is great, downtown, very walkable."

4097,Great deals and helpful sales people
4098,Very professional.
4099,Great service and employees were nice
4100,"While they try, they can not seem to get it right on the small things.  I asked for the car to be ready at 3, they call me at 3:30 and ask me to approve brake lights and cabin filter replacement that I had already authorized when I dropped it off. They don't wash your vehicle on site for you anymore, YOU have to take it all the way south of town to Kendall Toyota to use their car wash. If you are lucky enough to get a service advisor on the phone, better make sure that you have all your questions answered at that time as voicemail messages take days to get returned, if at all."
4101,Good meat and produce selection.
4102,"Nice place ,
It would be nice if they had a bigger yarn selection."
4103,Could not make it in Alaska without the 2nd of the big 2.
4104,"Oh! Oh! Fiori, how I love thee. Make sure you wear something which allows your waistline some wiggle room, the portions are generous and the food is incredibly difficult to resist. The wine selection (there's more beyond the Wine List, ask your server) is epic. This place is usually very low-key, dim & super cozy -- makes you want a nap after all the delicious food and wine. The servers here are more often than not the owners -- wonderful people. The baklava is homemade by one of the owners and if you are lucky, you will arrive on a day she has made some and have made it in before all the people who know her secret stop in and snatch it up. ;)"
4105,To go sandwiches
4106,I really liked the fajita quesadillas!! Soooo tasty I tell ya!!
4107,The food was excellent and yummy. And they have the best hot chocolate you can ever try. Good is. It not very expensive.
4108,"Great park ! Little bit of everything.  Small trail network connecting the nearby grade school play grounds , basketball court. Including several open field areas baseball field, fenced tennis courts, and a municipal covered pic and barbq area. Trash cans , doggy poop bags ensure pet owners can clean up after themselves."
4109,Always free samples. Great sandwiches and items for our Sweet-toothed brethren.
4110,"Fantastic, authentic southern Bar-b-que in the great white north.  Friendly and prompt service with a great selection of sauces for the excellently prepared food."
4111,Staff are unfriendly and rude.
4112,"Sub par even for Alaska. I have had a roller caster of service quality. Some days the food is pretty good, with quality service. Others the food is palatable at best, and I have waited for over an hour for service after being seated. I still go because it's one of the few 24/7 restraints in town."
4113,Wish it was back. Close to home and friendly young people
4114,Great enjoyed stay hope to be back.
4115,"Oil and tire change, what more needs to be said. i never had an issue here and have used them for years!"

4123,"With the exception of the wide-eyed, sloth-like foreigners, kids going crazy with the matching parents who don't know how to control them, junkies trying not to look like junkies so they can boost for their next fix, the homeless begging for change outside... This place is great... I think the McDonald's here is my favorite besides Spenard because they always recognize my family. ü§£"
4124,"Got the Spicy Pad Thai to try, was amazing! Hella upset I‚Äôm just now finding this place."
4125,"Friendly staff, very nice room, not to mention very clean."

4128,Rustic and artistic
4129,Great for classes and having a better start to getting your first pet
4130,"This place has everything you could want from a bakery. Great coffee with free refills, friendly staff, creative pastries, yummy breads, lovely outdoor seating, local art for sale on the walls, and all in a building that has some character. Any day in Homer should start with two sisters."
4131,Always delicious and quick!
4132,Very delicious food and an exciting atmosphere.
4133,"Very scenic setting, with very well presented historical data and narrations."
4134,"this place is trying to get on its feet and I'm sure it will. we thought what a strange combination, and Seoul casa delivers on combining 2 different flavor profiles exceptionally well. get a strawberry soju. the amigos tacos is where it's at. the waitress was amazing and said they would be rolling out a new menu so I'll be back."
4135,Try the Southern Tacos... nuff said.
4136,Very nice place !!   Served a lot of food !!   Just a little pricey but delicious !!
4137,Best cider in Anchorage. Fun spot to hang out. Food trucks here make for a great afternoon.
4138,Lots of walking trails and snow machine trails.
4139,"Jon and his team were spot on with expertise and assistance. A+, will be coming back often."
4140,"Love the place and what it has to offer but just had a unpleasant experience due to the fact that they don't take Mastercard. This is who services my bank, so I can't ever really shop here."
4141,Great local place with wonderful service and top quality food
4142,"Lady at register was very friendly, the orange shakes are awesome."
4143,Always good sushi. Never disappointed.
4144,"Nice menu, delicious food, friendly and helpful staff."
4145,Nice shop with something for everyone
4146,"Product service and quility people from the owner down,and i love shopping at a family owned business"
4147,Nice people and the hotel is close to downtown. I am not sure if a hotel/RV Park can get a 5 but....
4148,Too short a menu. Not all the items were available.
4149,This place is a classic. Their clam chowder is delicious.!! Pair with a sandwich or wrap and you've got the perfect lunch. I usually go for the chicken salad on bread or the cranberry turkey. They have many options from salads to burgers. The Perfect Cup does not disappoint.
4150,Didn't have what I wanted
4151,Now that's a concert hall.
4152,Fantastic food and staff
4153,Such an amazing school! The staff is absolutely wonderful! I'm very grateful my children have been able to be apart of CCS!
4154,Good selection of movies. 5 theaters and the 2 in main building have gotten new seating.
4155,This  store is not even close to the maui cold stone. I ordered a strawberry blonde and all  the girl did was add cool whip and mix it. She did not add the fresh strawberries nor the blonde topping. ... never again will I go here.
4156,live it
4157,"They have awesome halibut sandwiches there, some of the best in town!"
4158,Amazing food with great customer service and even better prices.
4159,Good price
4160,Yummy and great portions!
4161,"Food is always great but the service is very slow. If you are wanting a cozy place with time to talk, this is your place. If you're trying to get food on your lunch break..... Not so much."
4162,Great place always the best fruits and vegetables
4163,Perfect pit stop before being bored to death before a mandatory briefing. Keep up the good work.
4164,"Adore the space, the  drag shows they host are INCREDIBLE, but the food is phenomenal too! They have SUCH GOOD EGGS BENEDICT! Alfredo, the cook, is the man, his hollandaise was to die for. They allow vegetarian subs, I can't believe this place wasn't packed for after-night-out brunch/breakfast. The owner is super kind, and the service was over-the-top good (they lent us jumper cables when our car died + plugged it in for us!!!!)"
4165,"It's hit or miss, haha. I think they should do a pizza of the day and a Caesar salad for lunch, it would be pretty neat."
4166,"I wish this business well but I won't be interested in coming back a second time.
If this was the only barber shop in alaska I'd cut my own hair
went here cause my usual place was closed on a sunday
Their demeanor and communication dont match the price of $30, I'd say they compete with like 10 dollar great clips haircuts"
4167,I was sadly disappointed this last visit. 1st visit was great though. Foods were fresh and great tastes and portions were plenty.
4168,"Love the bar, nice views, great food and Cocktails!"
4169,Beer
4170,It's so busy that the food is always fresh and/or hot.
4171,Very helpful staff.

4173,Beautiful place
4174,"The rink is well maintained, although the seating is limited."
4175,Nice helpful people. I went here while shopping for my first snowmachine. They were so helpful that I still stop by to get small parts from time to time. I like to support small businesses that support people too
4176,"A great place to grab a bite to eat. They have a large selection of beers, wines, and liquors, as well as some inventive cocktails. My go to is the Two-Handed CBLTA with a spinach salad (ch√®vre and sliced strawberries!). And the fries - I can't explain how much I love these fries! They're simple shoestring, but I love the particular level of crispy that the chefs get here.
I recently came in on my birthday and had the ribeye, which was delicious! It was exactly what I needed. My family and I split the peanut butter pie - and I would have to recommend that you do the same!"
4177,Very good food
4178,Did not interact with staff but the structure and decor was nice. Much more spacious that i had believed and was nicer than expected
4179,You need to be around people.
4180,Fantastic theater! Wonderful experience!
4181,Very helpful and friendly
4182,"Having the birthday party here for my daughter is the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. Helpful staff, online forms making life easier  for sign up and invitation. More than half of the party is first timer and already having fun!

We‚Äôre making plans for coming here again for the next party!

Tips: Don‚Äôt forget to wear comfortable sports attire, take your time with kids, have breaks in between and enjoy your time here!"
4183,They were fast and efficient I would definitely use them again..
4184,Very helpful. Great services
4185,I love Bath and Bodyworks. The candles got me yes they‚Äôre expensive but you do not have to pay full price often they‚Äôre on sale between $12-$14 you can really get a good deal on candle day they always have coupons in the mail you are in coupons when you make purchases they constantly have sales it is so much fun to shop there. Even when I don‚Äôt shop I always go in to smell they have so many signature smells..... its to die for
4186,Horrible clam chowder and the service was basic but not terrible.  I tipped the base 15% but nothing extra.
4187,Loved it!!
4188,SHEEP DIP!!!!!
4189,Great place.
4190,One stop shopping for a week to 3 months  at a time.  Staff all peasant and keep everything going in a timely fashion
4191,Good prices and good choices
4192,Stupid they think closing early will save them from chronic
4193,Great service and got exactly what I asked for.
4194,AMAZING
4195,Seats seem very narrow compared to a standard theater. Clean and very empty on a Monday night.
4196,Volunteered here for a few weeks. Management wasn't the best. Wasn't the most cleanly or best selection.
4197,The rifle/pistol side is great! I do not shoot shotguns so I can't say anything about that side.
4198,I visited on Aug 13 to buy some CBD vape oil for anxiety and the gentleman at the counter ( can't remember his name) was very helpful. And the oil has helped me and I'm forever gracious to Hollyweed. Definitely recommend
4199,Great service!!!!!!
4200,Had a Great Experience and the Prices were better than Southside Garden Supply.
4201,Imagined lot more than it was...it seems a home/store converted to a Ice Museum...my expectations were much higher but seems ok to us...
4202,They were going to kill my cat
4203,Good food
4204,I did not enjoy the food and thought it was a little overpriced
4205,"Small aquarium with nice exhibits, very focused on Alaskan sealife. Well worth a visit."
4206,"Delightful, delicious, de-lovely!"
4207,Love it
4208,"Nice location. wide sites, so not crowded. We stayed in dry sites, which are cheap for a city centre site. The toilet and shower facilities are rather old and not very nice."
4209,So glad to have a bulk supply store back in town.....welcome to Fairbanks Costco
4210,Very nice!! Wonderful people
4211,The burgers are always awsome here and the people are great

4219,"Pho Lena has excellent food and service. Staff are polite and accommodating. Soups are their specialty, especially, their Pho Tom Yum (handmade rice noodles)."
4220,"Always tasty, excellent service. Not cheap, but it's worth it as a treat."
4221,New sagaya is the place to go for all the hard to find ingredients for almost any recipe
4222,"This place is really a staple in Anchorage, pizza is great and you can find something to please anyone in the family, my favorite is Santas little helper or the steak chipotle pizza, for chicken the spicy chicken picante is darn delicious.

They also have a variety of beers they brew in Alaska, Raspberry wheat is something a lot of people like, my favorite is the Hard apple ale or their Hefenwisen.

But be warned, it is a popular place so expect to wait a bit but it is worth."
4223,Always great customer service!
4224,Nice to have kitchen!
4225,Everything from Little Miller's is better.

4230,Brett was real helpful and respectful to Elders. Quyana.
4231,These people are awesome! I'm super allergic to marijuana but I needed to get some for my mother in law who has suffered a stroke... They were so compassionate and helpful...they helped me get the right kind for her (since I know absolutely nothing about it) and helped me stay in her price range and then they put it in a plastic container and three bags...they are absolutely amazing!
4232,Excellent food...We were not rushed during our dinner.  I'll be back again when I get a chance.
4233,The one on 5th St.

4235,Your pets are treated like a beloved relative.
4236,Nice store nice selection
4237,The ushers had a tour of the back of the house. It was fascinating. Ask if they might make it available to the public.
4238,"Never disappointing, from Lainey to Ken at the bar and service, lunch and dinner with Rebecca -- there's tremendous knowledge of Anchorage at this gem of a watering hole."
4239,"Polite, proffessional, friendly with great coffee! Totally worth the visit everytime"
4240,Only arrived a couple hours ago. So far very nice and fantastic scene3.
4241,Perfect nights rest
4242,"One of the best cuts I‚Äôve gotten in 38 years.  It doesn‚Äôt matter who you get, they are all good and pay attention to detail.  You get a great cut for a good price, can‚Äôt beat that."
4243,I had grilled salmon and it was close to medium but tender while vegetables were cooked just right. Another guest had the NY strip steak cooked medium rare which was close to medium. Was not as flavorful as those he is familiar with from steakhouses in Houston TX. The server was attentive and friendly.  Given this place was packed and required a 30-45 minute wait before seating. It was a good plus rating. Similar to other 4.1+ Star ratings of other restaurants in Seward. We did not drink any alcoholic beverages so cannot comment on beers and wine.
4244,Helpful staff
4245,"(Translated by Google) I like it because there are many sales at a low price

4246,"Not a bad place to shop for cloths, and rather cheap for what they sell..."
4247,"The only problem I had with this specific joann's is that it was pretty dirty and we could not for the life of us find an employee on the floor that could help us find what we were looking for. Sense the registers are behind a wall and the only way to exit the register area is to walk out or back through the line asking a cashier anything is just about impossible.

Other than that they had way better variety of crafts than the joanns out in wasilla. We also found diamond painting kits which have been impossible to find in stores and the variety of what they had was amazing. They were a bit more expensive than ones you can find online but I'm willing to pay the extra price because shopping for them online can be a gamble."
4248,Its fast food.
4249,"Good breakfast food, open 24 hours. The service has always been good"
4250,Great food weird location

4252,Great place for food and drinks. Order the halibut cheeks

4254,The best coffee and staff in the state.
4255,Took it to go but I can't wait to try it!
4256,"Touristy shopping, some good bargains."
4257,"Stopped in for quick dinner and drinks. I had the Hawaiian sliders which were good, juicy, good sauce. I shared the fried mushrooms which I'm going to have to order again later, very good! Also had a mauled Mary, their specialized bloody. Amazing!"
4258,"I've never had a good experience with this location. I've used this location twice in the last couple years and I've gotten nebulous answers from their customer service reps. This last case in particular I was assisting my mother in moving to Palmer. We tried to return the truck when I got a call from the Anchorage Old Seward office telling us the truck was due back all the way in Anchorage. We had the rep in the Matsu Valley office check for us, and he also told us we couldn't return it to the Matsu office. This led to us having to drive the truck all the way back to Anchorage incurring additional rental time, mileage and gas costs. I told the rep we were moving TO Palmer, and he never mentioned to me it wasn't a one way rental? Absolutely atrocious. I'll never rent from this location again."
4259,Great Pizza !!
4260,What an awesome furier! Learned a lot from the curator gal who never seemed to mind taking the time out to answer our questions.  Deffinately recommend. Plan on stopping in again next time when we're in the area!
4261,The store and Especially the Restrooms were clean and the employees friendly and helpful.
4262,Great spot for Lunch.  Good location.  Food is usually pretty fresh and doesn't take forever to come out.  Haven't had a bad experience yet.  Plus free pie on Wednesdays when you dine there.
4263,"They have feed, seed. Pet supplies. Garden and yard  care, and things you can't find anywhere else. Fun just to go in and browse.  Very friendly helpful staff."
4264,"Always a good experience here. My ribs were a little overcooked on the last visit, but this is a rare occurance. Still going back..."
4265,I have used Sunshine Rae multiple times over the past year. I've been very happy with the speed of their service and their prices. I also don't feel like they are trying to upsell me when I go to them for a vehicle repair. They also recently started using a computer system that sends convenient notifications and lets you to do work authorizations and payments online. This makes the process even more streamlined. Highly recommend this shop.
4266,Kinda spendy but they have interesting stuff
4267,"I have eaten here once as a birthday dinner from a company I worked for, the food is excellent."
4268,I went in exercise With a trainer and a friend work my a** off today the trainer did it great job I'll definitely go again
4269,The guys were knowledgeable wuth what I needed help with. And no waiting. Fast service.
4270,A great little spot in Soldotna. Had the Pancho special and was very surprised.
4271,The food wasnt up to par. Looked and tasted cheap.
4272,"I called Moore Monday morning because my boiler relief valve was trickling water.  They said they would try to work me in today.  They called back in about 10 min and said they could come immediately.  The technician showed up and quickly replaced the relief valve and expansion tank.  As well, he gave me a quick lesson on the operation of the system.  They will certainly be getting my business in the future.

Note that before calling Moore, I had contacted three other service companies.  The quickest any could get here on normal non-overtime was two day from now."
4273,It was pretty nice
4274,Good food.  The beautiful live flowers just made the whole place just special
4275,A bit empty. Amazing service. Portions were a little bit small but that depends on what you ordered as well.
4276,Great deli food!
4277,"I love Dimond Walmart. They have great selections on many different things. The people are great who work there also. Check it out, you will live it too!üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
4278,"Each time I am in Anchorage, I come here. I love the environment and the people. Food and service really are 5 Star. I miss my night's sleep thinking about the Spicy Chicken, Beer Biscuits and Gravy. Next time, will try something else. Anything on the menu is fantastic!"
4279,Excellent comfort food and service
4280,Fun
4281,"Too slow of cashierz, never enuf 2 help the ppl shopping & trying 2 check out...cashierz put heavy itemz on top uv eggz, üçû, üçå üçå etc...too dense for me...thatz where i go once a month 2 help doug shop...i can deal with THAT..."
4282,"yes I'm a dude who gets his feet did ,,,,, yes but Mr. Tony does a great job on these white feet ,,, it's very professional ,, I love it very much ,,, I've been here 3 times"
4283,Love the play area for my toddler
4284,Its clean with wi-fi and showers. The only downside is it's by the train tracks and you can hear the trains but ear plugs fix that!
4285,Prime rib was tough and chewy. Everything else was good..

4295,"Very personable, fast service, price was good"
4296,Over priced unless you have a membership. The 18$ wash (their best option) was over in about 5 minutes and did get the car completely clean.
4297,excellent place for breakfast
4298,Not a lot has changed since I was kid going here over 20 years ago. Most of the same animals and a lot of them are local animals to the region. Small compared to other city zoo's. It is worth checking out but not a place you would pay to go in again and again.

4300,Dinner with friends is always yummy
4301,"I love Eastern European cuisine, and this was outstanding!  As hard as it was, I had to narrow down my choices here- everything sounded so good.  I decided to order a few different things, that I'd never tried before.

The service was great, the food was fresh, and the portions were huge, for the price!"
4302,"I have daydreams about the pita falafel. It's so good, super filling and satisfying without being heavy."
4303,"This McD's is pretty far from home, but we often drive through for coffee and a snack when we're in town. Our burgers, fish sandwiches, and chicken nugget meals are always hot and well wrapped for these days of no dining in. Right now our coffee is good and hot and we are happy, as always, with our meals."
4304,"Great service, amazing selection of goods and affordable prices. Love the caramel, coconut cashew! Highly recommend for a snack on the go."

This last time we didn't receive part of our order, we pressed the red button at the stall to tell them we didn't receive it and NO ONE SVER CAME TO GIVE US THE REST OF OUR FOOD. we waited 20 more mins. Had to leave. We love you guys. But won't be coming back now"
4310,"My parents are trying to sell their house, they got bamboozled into paying $800 for ""professional photos and staging"". The person brought in props that didn't really match the color scheme. Some being a complete eye sore.  All open houses and showings have been done by other real estate agents, by other companies, their person is not easily accessible and seems like she does nothing to help sell the house, except to call them to lower the price. From not getting the house on the market when they said they would, part of the listing was wrong, and trying to get them to lower the price on the 3rd day of it being listed. The papers have horrible ink, makes the rooms look darker than they are.  In fact an agent from another company left a horrible review saying their was no flow to the decor, ""fire the decorator"", and it looked like people were still living there. There doesn't seem to be much communication between their realtor and whoever does a showing. Their agent wants to do new photos now, because even she thinks they aren't that good.
Bottom line if you want someone to work towards selling your house, find another agency.
If you want to waste time and money, and get the runaround when you have questions this is the company for you."
4311,"The very high prices justify the view, not the food."
4312,Good product friendly staff and good prices
4313,The goat cheese salad is to die for!
4314,This Costco is just too small
4315,"So far, I have to say that I really like this place. If you're headed south, you don't have to run all over Fairbanks to get stuff like gas, beer and other items.  On memorial day weekend on my way to Denali, I drove the rv to uhaul to get propane.  Weird experience there, buy that's a different story.  Anyway, I left west Fairbanks to head there for the propane.  Then I go to Sam's for gas.  Finally on the road, I pass Ester gas and see that propane is 30 cents cheaper than uhaul, and gas is eleven cents cheaper than Sam's!  If you're filling a 40   lb propane tank and 50 gallon gas tank, these rate save a great deal of cash.  So this will be my only stop when I'm leaving town now to get propane and fuel.  The store is pretty good, too.  There is a good selection of adult beverage, the store is clean, and the staff is friendly.  They also have a self-service heating oil pump that operates 24-7.  I've only been here once so far, but they have impressed me and I plan to stop there just about every weekend as I travel the state (at least when I'm going south).  If you havent stopped here yet, I encourage you to check it out. For me, it's convenient and they have better prices.  I'm sold."

4323,Cheep
4324,"The food is as useful good ..this time I had Eggs Benedict very good.
But they have to do something with the Bathrooms..they are beyond bad ..disgusting actually and has been for several years ...... but the food is good."
4325,"The owners are great and the crepes are generous.  The menu had a great variety of sweet, savory, pizza and breakfast crepes, including waffles."
4326,"I bloody love this place. Everyone here is awesome, knowledgeable and very easy going to first-timers. They pride themselves on only the authentic stuff and they are awesome for it."
4327,"Nice store, and nice staff."
4328,Love the wonderful autmospere and freshly made Donuts
4329,Very accommodating.
4330,Costco is life!
4331,This location is okay because it's part of Safeway. Typically these locations don't have as good of customer service and they don't quite understand specially ordered drinks. Also the staff there seems to speak very openly about personal stuff and loudly at that including striking against the company that they work inside of. The drinks are pretty good as long as you order what's on the menu.
4332,Hard to beat prices and selection for all your fabric and crafting needs.
4333,Good prices on most things
4334,"The store looks great, but you can only find help if you stand in line. After you stand in line out of the 8 items I put on the counter was cashed out they were put in a garment bag but one pair of my pants was folded up into a small rectangle and placed in the bottom of the bag after I asked that it be placed back on the hanger that was sitting on the counter."
4335,"No reservations.  No problem getting a room.  Note: off-peak season (this was a March stay).

I had driven down from Fairbanks to spend a day in Anchorage.  Having arrived in Anchorage at around 6:30 p.m.; I used the Yelp app to look for a fairly priced/decent hotel without a reservation.  Because I had a car, I also wanted a hotel with no or small charge for parking.  I narrowed my search to the Marriott so I called to inquire about rooms and rates.

The hotel staff that answered was very helpful, stating rates; I inquired about discount rates and he offered me the corporate rate since the hotel was no busy.  Ten minutes later we pulled into the valet and in 15 minutes after the call we were in a very nice room facing downtown and the bay.

Everything about this room was great.  It was clean, it was comfortable and it had great view.  Moreover, it is centrally located - walking distance to all of downtown attractions.

The staff is very warm and welcoming."
4336,Wonderful service and I love my hair!
4337,"Best cafe I've ever been to. Prices are good, the food is along the lines of Himalayan comfort food. It gets me out of my comfort zone by assuring that everything will taste amazing! The hot chai is a must."
4338,Peter's is one of my favorites.  I love their lunch Bento box.  It is a great price for a lot of food.  The food is also very good.  They have free refills on non-alcoholic drinks which is also nice as some small restaurants don't offer such a service.  I always leave there full but not stuffed.  The price point is very reasonable and the staff is very efficient.
4339,Incredible tasting food! Great friendly service!!
4340,Great sushi!
4341,"This is not a real steakhouse. When sitting down. To order, we asked about how good their steak was, and the answer we got was "" we have a brand new cook, so it should be ok "" we then ordered cheeseburgers."
4342,Good store has everything I need for household groceries. Employees are always nice and polite.
4343,Honest and friendly crew
4344,Great people working there.
4345,"Went to have lunch at Wendy's today. The manager April was running the register & taking orders. While taking our order she started to correct an employee who was cleaning the counter off of a spilled drink. She was loud and rude,talking down to an employee while dealing with us at the samend time. The while we were paying she continued to yell at the employee and when she said why aren't you responding to me ""Jamie"", he said I didn't think you were talking to me since that's not my name. She then proceeded to tell the employee what ever I want to & you will do what your told. If this is how Wendy's treat their employees infront of customers then we will not be returning to eat with company again."
4346,Love it
4347,Superb amazing high quality sushi and the prices are spot on as well. This is my new favorite sushi spot. The service is so good they literally run to your table and use yes and no ma'am and sir!

4352,"As Emerald Executive Elite members, it was my worst experience! Besides I got a dirty vehicle, I wasn't allowed to change vehicle because they ""locked the keys"" an hour before closing. They won't pre-arrange to change vehicle because I have to call first the next morning. I'm already in front of the counter and they can't do that for me. Terrible and worst rental service I have ever experienced with National."
4353,Great food great staff !
4354,Always a great place to bring the kids
4355,"Gas and alcohol is affordable compared to off post, but cigarettes are cheaper at Walmart though. The staff is not the friendliest here tough, the Richardson shoppette is better."
4356,"I like this place, easy going people, love the weed."

4381,I was at McDonald's 4 days ago and ordered a cup of coffee it took so long (about)20 minutes to get. This is deplorable they weren't even that busy it was already paid for I used my card.
4382,Convenient
4383,"I went to McDonald's this morning in North Pole and purchased 3 meals. 2 were mc griddle meals and the other was a burrito meal. The cost of each meal according the sign is $6.69.  I did not specify Drink size with the meals, only type of drink and ice preferences. Upon receiving my food the drinks were obviously large's.  I checked my receipt and it showed I was charged a drink up charge of 50 cents per meal. I spoke with a manager whom stated that I must have requested a large. I said I absolutely did not I only requested a meal.She then went on to tell me that she tried with their check out to have it be a small drink and the price came back as the same price I was charged. She said their system shows ""upcharge"" and they dont know why and others have had this same concern before. I accepted it however I am including a picture of the signs prices and my receipt. They lied. They stole. Or they need to adjust prices on sign."
4384,"What can I say that you don‚Äôt already know, right? Great gym, even greater customer service. I love the 24 hour access, swimming schedule and pool availability. The huge selection of cardio and strength equipment is really nice making it so you don‚Äôt have to wait in line to get a workout in. I recently found out that there‚Äôs even tanning. I am gonna have to give that a try."
4385,Good enough service.  The owners do a great job. Steak was low grade & hard to get the waiter's attention.   Appetizers were great.

Not to mention his drinks are pure works of art.

4398,Decent place.  They introduced me to the pickleback. Fairly lowkey most of the times but there are times when the patrons will get too rowdy.... then it's time to go.

4406,"Birthday dinner on a Tuesday night with my mom and a fellow student(3 total guests)- I must say that our entrees and wine were absolutely amazing. 5 stars there! However, a fellow couple nearby was highly intoxicated and crude while publicly fondling each other and other exceptionally loud acts of PDA the entire time. Our server(while she seemed like a very nice girl) was very obviously high and seemed increasingly worse throughout our visit. She had her bases covered when she did come by, and she was kind. But she could not manage to keep her eyes open at all during interaction, among other motor skills she was struggling with, and ultimately it was heartbreaking- hence my 3 star rating."
4407,Awesome park not too busy.
4408,"Very cool views and oceanfront here right on the spit! Camping spots were small, and right off the parking lot. Not too far from the road either. The porta potty was not too bad. Not sure I would camp here, but definitely a great day trip to hang at the beach!"
4409,Great food but pretty expensive
4410,Great outdoors! Cabin and restrooms available.  Fire pit right off the lake!
4411,Great products. Decent price.
4412,"Okay for a weekend getaway, but not a good place for a base camp for more than that.  Close to airport and Mindenhall Glacier, but far from town.  Shuttle and breakfast we're not reliable.  No elevator to second floor, ask for room on first floor if stairs are a problem."
4413,"I'd like to say that we have had good experiences here before. But tonight wasn't there best showing. We started by getting drinks spilled all over my son and table. Stuff happens they responded to it the way I would expect cleaning up up quickly and offering to dry my son's shirt. Once things for settled we ordered. There were 6 of us, 3 ordered fish and chips. Took about 40 minutes to get our food, when it arrived all 3 fish and chips had raw batter inside, my son's was bad enough that I told them I didn't feel we should pay for it. They were very willing to take it off the bill and offered to replace it. But as my 10 son said ""that was a really long wait for it not to be cooked"". Out of the mouth of babe's. The staff was very nice, and I truly think this was the exception not the rule. But please make sure the situation is reviewed and adjustments."
4414,Phenomenal Alaskan ice cream!
4415,"We didn't go in to this park and I wonder how many ever do... It's immense - bigger than some entire countries! Beautiful to drive alongside for many, many miles."
4416,"Great pizza. A 36"" pie is available for take out !!! Good beer and wine menus. Our waitress ""Danell"" treated us like old friends. We will return."
4417,This location is incredibly slow when it comes to the drive through line. Not sure how it is inside but expect to wait 10 minutes or more in the drive through if you use it. Kind of defeats the purpose of a drive through. The drinks were alright and the food was good.
4418,"I wondered around in here looking for my college books with my friends and no one bugged us, we didn't want help so we didn't ask. After we found them we were able to just sit in the coffee area even though the coffee shop itself was closed (all one room.) The lighting was nice and the chairs were comfy."
4419,Always a pleasant and yummy experience. I've been eating here for 23 years.

4429,"Had a wonderful visit, got to chat with Santa and Mrs.Claus. Even stopped by to see the reindeer"
4430,Awesome place my friend works there.
4431,Very busy parking is confusing

4433,Sorry food was not good got sick.
4434,Great service!

4436,"My local Starbucks is really just a bike ride away (assuming I‚Äôd get on my bike). It‚Äôs a quicker drive. Very conveniently located in the heart of Eagle River it is a reliable stop for tried and true regular and seasonal favorites. Their drive-thru has remained open throughout Covid. The people who have worked here to make sure we all get our coffee fix are no less than heroes. Grace helped me out today and made me feel less of a fool when I went to grab the no contact mug they are handing drinks out in. I love their cold brew but decided on an iced green tea today, extremely refreshing! Their breakfast options and pound cakes are also delicious."
4437,I lot
4438,Good bar in Ketchikan
4439,The burger made to order was spectacular.
4440,This is a very nice family friendly location.
4441,Clean fast
4442,Fast. Dock workers looked professional.  Thanks
4443,"Poor customer service, the lady screamed at me because she forgot the plastic ware. In front of all their guests."
4444,"When I first walked in I realized an employee not wearing gloves handling food put three fries he dropped on the counter back in a basket, and then I was charged for two meals when I only requested one. When the shift leader came over it seemed like she didnt know what she was doing. I dont like germs on my fries or food especially when none of the food handlers were wearing gloves. Not going there for a long time."
4445,Good service that us usually pretty fast.
4446,Gracious service!
4447,Nice selection. Good pricing.
4448,Really nice staff and amazing food.
4449,Beach was clean  people were friendly
4450,Great place for tacos
4451,I just went to snake one of their drains as a drain technician and was rewarded with 10 wontons smothered in teriyaki and Secret sauce. Didn't even spend a dime. I am definitely coming back with my family to this place to eat again! Good hospitality!
4452,Fantastic food and cinnamon rolls
4453,Good eats
4454,"Lots of options, great store"
4455,Love this church.

4459,Difficult to access but gas is cheaper with Fred Meyer points.
4460,Good place average
4461,Awesome seating and customer friendly
4462,Love all the different locations! Just as much as I love the food!
4463,Great food
4464,"Another mall that let itself get overrun by teenagers.
My pastors wife was robbed at gunpoint years ago just trying to walk into this mall with her children.
With the exception of Best Buy and restaurants that have private entrances I can't see any reason to go back."
4465,Good food would be even better if they didn't make every thing with apples in it. It could be just the things we ordered. I would recommend this restaurant.
4466,"Friendly, courteous, cleanly, fast, price is fair. An awesome barber right here. Highly recommend this business."
4467,Dickmonalds. Awful place to eat
4468,"Ample parking space and feels safe, the drive going in the gate is bumpy and uneven though."
4469,My first experience with Kendall Ford and it has left a good impression.  This is  a no pressure kinda of  car dealership with knowledgeable salesman and finance staff. They give it to you straight. They show you what you want to see. They work with you to get the paperwork done quickly and efficiently.
4470,"Looked clean, tidy, organized when I visited"
4471,"Great casual pizza and nice staff, good beer prices"
4472,Great food and friendly staff

4475,Their king crab was good up until I felt ice. They fixed it.
4476,"They are wonderful, kind and happy. The food will help more than I can express. Thank you."
4477,"This is a standard diner, but that isn't a bad thing! The coffee is fine, but they're always making sure you're cup is full. The food is out quick and tastes pretty great. The staff was super nice when we walked in and immediately sat us down. The waitress was very kind and made breakfast very pleasant for us!"
4478,"Excellent food! Good size portions and nice, cozy atmosphere."
4479,"These guys are another favorite sandwich and sub place, their beef stew is something I usually get almost every Tuesday and I'm definitely addicted. Of course I love their sandwiches too, and they have a great selection and all around fair prices. Pizza is also yummy!"
4480,Didn't get bugs off of my window
4481,"The Buckner Building is definitely worth the visit. It's reputed to be the most haunted place in Whittier, Alaska. Which is considered to be the most haunted town in Alaska. Definitely a creepy place. Situated on a hill on the outskirts of town. It's huge, and was built at the height of the Cold War in 1953. Named after General Buckner, who was the highest ranking officer killed by the enemy in WWII. It was meant to be occupied for 1000 Soldiers."
4482,great service
4483,Fast food that they normally get it right by the 3rd time...well hopefully they do.
4484,The selection is wonderful. The staff is helpful. The prices are just too high on most items.
4485,Very good service.
4486,Good selection of Eastern European food.
4487,Had everything I needed
4488,"Nice store to get some fresh and delicious goodies; fudge, chocolates, truffles, etc. Great place for some neat Alaska souvenirs. Love the giant chocolate waterfall"
4489,"Yes, they sell trailers, but even better they take care of most DMV needs on Saturdays! No longer do I need to take off work for tags or titles. I will bring my business here all the time."
4490,Go see Robyn Chai. She does amazing things with cuts and color.

4492,Great food! Fun atmosphere! Prices are excellent!
4493,Good planes and greet service all staff is very friendly
4494,Great food and service
4495,"Ugh, this place is a throwback to the 80's when it was built, and decorated. It's just kind of tired and in bad need of updates, deep cleaning and some modern soundproofing. The noise levels from the hallway and adjacent rooms was terrible, and when we were there, there were a bunch of kids running all over the hotel all the time, and the staff couldn't be bothered to ask the adults to help keep it down and burn off their energy outside. The basement breakfast bar was really odd, and in a very dim bar that just seemed... odd. They had eggs and brown and serve meat, so I guess they have that going for them. They did have plenty of outlets outside for block heaters. Not ALL rooms have kitchenettes, so if you want one like the website says, be sure to demand it at check in."
4496,Good coffee
4497,Excellent smoked prime rib special!
4498,"Good option if you want something not fast food while on JBER, the Tacos are pretty good, just a bit pricey!"

4502,These guys are great! Awesome drinking chocolate!
4503,A great place to stay with a lot to do. This is the stepping off place to Denali National Park. Take the bus and enjoy. You will enjoy the resort and river that runs next to it. Take advantage of everything if you get the chance.
4504,"Good food, great location. Love the chicken bacon avocado sandwich."
4505,Amazing sites and great walk through history. Fun times for the whole family and a great way to spend time outdoors.
4506,"All of my animals are seen here. They receive prompt, personal care. The facilities are clean and well maintained and the services are affordable."
4507,Great customer service said to see it's closed on Mondays üòî

4511,It where you go to pick up the cruise ship.
4512,We finally took the little drive up to Talkeetna and are so glad that we did.  A pleasant step into history.

4514,Great place to watch football games!  We had the Wings and they were definitely some of the best in the city.
4515,"I love this place, they always hook it up with good deals, correct every mess up without hesitation."

4523,Favorite dinner place great ü¶Ä
4524,"Great Quality Food, Decent Portions, Down to Earth Price and Staff. Jeff our Waiter was very attentive. The Latouche location needs new seats for some of the booths and restrooms are filthy during peak hours."
4525,Service was terrible my wife sandwich was burnt then after 20 minutes I finally delivered another one and it was raw will never go back there again
4526,My home
4527,"Having shopped several Brown Jug stores around town, and having visited this particular store several times, I have to surmise that this is the one that wins on fast and friendly customer service. If this is because the boss is treating his people well, then keep up the good work! The store is small but the selection is nice. I can always find what I am looking for here, and I always leave with a smile on my face."
4528,Delicious!
4529,Helpful and had a great beard
4530,It gets the job done
4531,"The ignition interlock installation went smoothly and in a timely fashion. Bring cash because that's the only payment he'll accept, since he's been burned before by people with plastic. Once the installation is complete, any other services require you to call Intoxalock and make an appointment before he'll even talk to you about it."
4532,They never have what I need and its all spaced out everywhere...
4533,"All 3 of us loved our dinner here. My boys had burgers, and I had chicken. Being from bbq country, I know bbq. The chicken was as tasty as any I've had. The spicy mustard sauce was exceptional. Great beer selection. Great service."
4534,Enjoyed this place. Was not cheap but was good. The seafood was fresh and tasty.
4535,Great food and nice atmosphere.
4536,"Best matcha in town, plus authentic Chinese food you can't get anywhere else"
4537,"We got coffee and they were fast, friendly and the coffee was great!!!"
4538,Just go! STUNNING.
4539,The bathrooms/outhouses were so clean.  I was so impressed i wouldn't let anyone use my motorhome.
4540,Made a special order not on menu and got my order‚ò∫
4541,"Nov 2020: first real snow with rain and nastiness; i drove across town in the early morning. Not once did i slide into or spin my tires out of any intersection. Given you will assume i was driving safely (good choice), although driving the highways and side roads my ioniq still held strong not being a nightmare to drive in. Far better than the prius we had previously, i haven't even put on my studs. I'm also still rocking over 45 mpg in town. The wife drove out to the valley day prior and said the drive was enjoyable.
I look forward to take my car on trips now, it's not a harrowing, anxiety-filled journey any longer.
Added a star, now full 5.

Aug 2020: I have dealt with every department i could imagine dealing with and have nothing negative to say. Everything agreed to in purchasing has been followed through with, not once can i say i was mislead. Honestly had a worse time dealing with my bank than every single person here.

Service department is on top of it so far, you can get transportation to and from the shop, so one car households aren't put out.
Sales (i only dealt with Lee directly) come across genuine and don't putz. You want the car, you get that car. Prices aren't even bloated high from NADA (I checked before talking shop), yet they still play ball.
Finance is nice and don't try to bully. Logan and i had to deal with my bank for at least an additional 40 minutes, all error on the bank side. Even after and before i spent hours with the bank, it's stupid.

Needless to say, i would come back, i would trust them to do what they say, i would refer others here."
4542,Young lady at the front desk was very patient and helpfull working an issue with our account regarding some items we were returning.  Shout out to Ashley at the Fairbanks REI store.   Thanks
4543,New owners and new menu. If you have been here before it's worth a trip back to see the improvements.
4544,The food is delicious and hot. The staff are extremely friendly and always very helpful.
4545,If you want to watch  soccer is good place
4546,Super helpful staff they were awesome
4547,I always go there for my groceries! If you go enough you'll know it like the back of your hand. Really nice workers there aswell!
4548,Great and speedy service every time Ive come through. The prices are great and the service is great.
4549,The Crow's nest breakfast was really great.
4550,"This is probably one of the only places in town you can get shabu shabu, even though it‚Äôs a bit pricey it‚Äôs worth it for what it is. The fish is also really fresh every time I come here which is great."
4551,The best desserts
4552,Very nice place and good food
4553,"Seriously,  one of the best places in Anchorage.  The oysters are like none I've ever had. Absolutely delicious!"
4554,Absolutely a one of a kind gem. Magical!!
4555,Gas at a decent price.
4556,"Fast service, friendly staff and decent food add up to a good fast food dining experience. Their flavorings and quality has degraged over the years, so one of my stars is due to nostalgia and memories of what they used to taste like."
4557,Very good sweets
4558,Always a slow check out
4559,The food was good. The service was awful! Waitress was slow on getting drinks an getting the check. Talked to other tables an they all agreed. If there is a big fight there should be no reason for that poor of service.
4560,"Clean store!! I dont go here often, but the times I have been,  employees are friendly and helpful.  Great sales!! Love the Starbucks in this store...."
4561,Great atmosphere family friendly awesome food!!
4562,Beautiful easy and fast hike
4563,Highly recommended!
4564,It's a nice place to shop
4565,They were fast and decently priced!
4566,Great sushi. Worth it.
4567,Owner was very pushy. Tea was $3.
4568,Great place to enjoy the sunshine!
4569,"Seemed to just go through the motions. My hair is uneven, even though I specifically Asked for the front to be straight across, the left side looks longer than the right. The left side burn is longer than the right. I stopped going to Great Clips for much the same reasons."
4570,Quick service!
4571,Never disappointing!
4572,"I always go through when I am low on $$$ and starving and order their FRIED ZUCCHINI.  It is so delicious and makes me feel like I am really not eating junk food, lol. üíñüòç"
4573,"Great food, great service, great beers."
4574,Went on a nice sunny day and had a great time with the kiddos. Very family friendly. Even though it was packed we easily found parking and the rest of our group had a spot already.
4575,"Sicily's pizza is pretty good. The prices are constant with Fairbanks. They will deliver pizza to your house at 2 in the morning, which is pretty awesome!

They do tend to slightly overcook the pizza, if you ask them to pull it out a little early it usually comes out just right. They also give you a discount for ordering online."
4576,Fast and friendly also get your munchies on in the deli!!
4577,Very helpful
4578,Sure nice in here
4579,Late summer 2018 they are still working on the park new playset and new landscaping big field for dogs to run in.  I have seen some sketchy stuff going on earlier this year but its shaping up to be a nice park
4580,Great place for anything you might want or need.
4581,Awesome service. Very friendly and prompt with calling with updates on my car. Staff have always been upfront with me on any issues that come up and have always stood by their work.
4582,Nice
4583,"This is a required stop if you're visiting Alaska. If you're coming here for dinner do expect a good wait. They have a patio area where you can hang out with your friends and a drink while you wait, so that helps the time fly by quicker.

The pizza here is the main attraction. My go-to is the Chicken Parmesan pizza. Never fails. Pair it with an apple ale and you're all set!"
4584,Everything seafood is amazing
4585,Made an appointment for the morning...didn't get my vehicle till the end of the day.
4586,Best car wash in Anchorage
4587,Beautiful view
4588,"I love this place. Great coffee, food and people!"
4589,Quick service through drive thru.
4590,The RV wand was plugged lost $3. Thankfully my camper fit through the pull through. Won't go there again want too much money for too little time.
4591,Nice senior menu.
4592,"The Noisy Goose is my favorite breakfast place in the valley. The food is good. The staff is friendly, and I enjoy the Alaskan atmosphere inside."
4593,I came here expecting some of the best burgers and fries... and left disappointed so disappointed I only ate a few fries and two bites of my burger. I had high hopes after seeing people rave about this place. Maybe way back in the day this place was the popping place to eat at but it‚Äôs moved downhill. Staff were friendly tho so that was nice
4594,It's Taco Bell :) enjoy it when it's time.
4595,My son loves this pizza
4596,A long-time family favorite.
4597,In a convenient location on the way into the Matsu with decent rooms and a bar and grill downstairs with good food and drinks.
4598,Front desk professional polite great food and drinks lovely room
4599,"Just walked out.  Horrible service and not sanitary at all.  Reuse glasses, do not wash. 1st brewery I have had to walk out of in Alaska.  Ugh!  #disappointed"
4600,This was my first and last trip here. Empty pans all over the buffet and it's not even busy. Complete waste of money.
4601,Wonderful food. Great atmosphere!
4602,"Super fun place, highly recommend!"
4603,Decent small park. Lots of space for running
4604,"(Translated by Google) Terrific !!! We ate very well, at reasonable prices, very good service

(Original)
Buen√≠simo!!! Comimos muy bien, a precios razonables, muy buena atenci√≥n"
4605,Good service
4606,Nice rooms. Far from town and they offer limited shuttle to it.
4607,"Lots of good information,  need to pay for a self guided tour."
4608,"This place is of a lesser standard; like one of the other reviews said,though- don't think you have any options, because it's the only theater for 365 miles. I've lived in Fairbanks most of my life and was goig to movies at the original Goldstream 16, which really was better; processed food, commercials before the movies( like their ads>your comfort )and the prices are SO unreasonable it barely makes it a choice to do on any regular basis. More product choice is cool, but that's about it..."
4609,The doctor is amazing! Very fun and relatable. Covid practices seem sound. Would highly recommend.
4610,Very.... Quaint!
4611,"The food is good, the waitress is the best, and she does an awesome job even when it's so busy! Thank you Chrystal!"
4612,Always find something  handy
4613,Decent price people not to close
4614,Very unhealthy food.
4615,"For the dudes:
First off Happy Nail is simply just a delightful environment. They play soothing music and have comfortable chairs. The staff is very professional and will take good care of you.You can come in here with your girl and just chill out. Get your feet scrubbed and try not to laugh when it tickles. Just play on your phone and be a man about it. Sit next to your lady and have some quality time. Pamper her without even having to give that foot rub you promised. Yes it can cost a bit to get treated well like this but just go have some fun. It is worth it."
4616,Had some extra time stop by and had a awesome banana split. Thank you guys best banana split I've had in years keep up the good work
4617,"Excellent pizza place with great service. Tons of beer on tap, vegan food options,  and meat lovers options ;)"
4618,Love this place! Ice cream is always delicious! Claudia does an awesome job with our ice cream and customer service!
4619,"Its great food there my family always go there, if your gonna go with your family go there! üòÉüíØ"
4620,"Started doing laundry here, 3.50 for washing and 50cents per 5mins on the dryer. Was pretty empty when i came in so was an easy process. Open early too"
4621,They will take advantage of you and your scenario take your money and leave you disappointed
4622,"WOW. 1 pm on a Tuesday in front of the Bragaw Costco. I hope that I never have to write a stronger negative review. This is a small KFC outlet and the hired help was FLAWLESS. My ""beef"" is the edible portions of food are small for the price. And greasy. The worst part today for us is that there was a very drunk and GASEOUS native woman doing her best to survive in the corner booth. You could see where she had peed herself as she stumbled away. If you want to die before you are 40 eat HERE regularly."
4623,"Been a customer for almost 20 yrs and always clean and always carry the majority of what we are looking for, and some good niche lines of food."
4624,Good for young & adult for having together shaping art projects or home it was berry  Nice store.
4625,They have Big and Tall clothing..
4626,F Street Station is infinitely times better than Orso if you‚Äôre indecisive about where to eat or drink in Anchorage! It has so much character and it‚Äôs amazing to sit at the bar and watch the kitchen create magic in front of you. They even have a huge block of cheese where you go up and just carve off what you need complimented with crackers. Will definitely come back
4627,Good food and good service.
4628,Made it my way with xtras fast and hot .
4629,"Friendly service and pretty good food. Scallops seemed a little soggy but tasted great. Fried oyster was better but the carrot cake was the best. Look for the entrance on the far side, slightly hidden between the building nextdoor."
4630,Good food
4631,"I had the reindeer stew, which was surprising with its subtle hint of cinnamon. I wouldn‚Äôt think that would be a good addition to a stew but I was wrong. Lots of local art hanging on the walls."
4632,"Brandon and Ryan where fantastic at pick up. If your on JBER and needing to do a pick up definitely ask for them! They did a great job at making sure they didn't damage the walls in the garage as they where moving things to the truck, they worked quickly and efficiently I think it took no longer then 30 minutes from the time they started loading to the time they where done. They where also very polite. Thank you for making the final days of our move out great!"
4633,"Not enough parking,  unless you're there stuy 530 am"
4634,they are very professional and friendly!
4635,"A bit pricey, but otherwise good."
4636,Last tuesday 5$ pizza
4637,Good atmosphere.  I'll try the poppyseed pancakes next time.
4638,"Great place for ""gifts"" and popcorn for Long buss ride"
4639,Very friendly staff
4640,Feels like Alaska!
4641,"Best experience ever!
I was welcomed warmly and automatically felt at ease and relaxed.
The nurses are amazing they go above and beyond not only for you but for your family as well.
My surgeon (Dr.Kim Wright) was the best!  He came to see me before and after the surgery. He spoke with me and my family about what exactly was going to happen and was happening. He made sure I was comfortable and felt ok. He truly went above and beyond.
I will be recommending him and the hospital to everyone I know."
4642,"Just a great restaurant for pho, curry, noodles.  The servers and staff are friendly and helpful and the dishes are always savory.   We especially like the curries."
4643,Check out can be a little slow
4644,The kids always have a blast here.  We will definately come back.
4645,"I had great experience! Everyone was friendly, professional, and very efficient. Lovely office in a fabulous location."
4646,"Really enjoyed our visit here.   Lamb shank was amazing.   Steak with romaine was a surprise.  Not a huge dish but really satisfying and delicious.  Worked well with an appetizer and left room for dessert.
Great drink options.
Staff was attentive and responsive.   Great experince all around."
4647,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I appreciate that management took care of the situation and tried to reverse the issue afterall but I am not sure if I will come back or not.
When I took my dog there I wanted them to do a check up, instead they only relied on the concerns I had initially mentioned at the front desk and i felt they didnt look at anything else. Front desk was not friendly nor very helpdull when I tried to have some answers a few days later."
4648,Special thank you to the chef that chopped the extra sausage I ordered up into my meal. The breakfast was amazing.
4649,This place is a pass.
4650,Great place to spend with the kids
4651,They went down hill a bit. Had them at 5 stars but they always have the approximate time for take out off by like 20 to 30 minutes. They give you the wrong desserts even when asked if they were sure about it. The price is the same with the service lacking which means I have to drop the rating. Pizza still generally good but the service needs improvement now. Or lower the price.
4652,I had Claribelle and she was very nice as well as Doctor Park he was very thoughtful of any pain
4653,The airport was clean and the staff we did business with were helpful and friendly.
4654,It was ok. I sure miss the Mexican pizza tho.
4655,Family favorite
4656,Good variety! Sometimes it run out of few items at the time.
4657,Ok Place
4658,"The slogan is ""Home of cheap beer and lousy food"", and it's not far off.  The halibut cheek appetizer was really good and so was the beer, but that was about it.  The salmon didn't have any flavor and the fried shrimp batter was burnt and fell off. Atmosphere was really neat.  I'm not saying don't go, just don't go expecting too much..."
4659,Great camp ground! Had a blast when the family and friends went camping... great atv trails... careful of the river though..
4660,Trendy good eats. Great healthy options.
4661,"We visited here for lunch and there was a bit of a wait, around 30mins or so but we were good with it. We started with the clam chowder which was absolutely the best we've had. Then we ordered the char-grilled platter for the table which was the star - everything was done very well. We followed it up with entrees which were good but not as much as the platter. If you're getting dessert, I'd recommend the creme brulee. Overall a good experience, and the best food we had in Homer"
4662,Patrick was a wonderful server and we would highly recommend the champagne brunch!
4663,food is great......service is slower no matter what time of day you visit. Overall....good place to have breakfast with family and friends.
4664,Lot of nice shops.
4665,"Expensive, but awesome"
4666,Good when your drunk
4667,Great food and great atmosphere! Will definitely go back. My sushi rolls were delicious and my husband enjoyed the orange chicken.
4668,Friendly lady.. But hairs in food :( The lady didn't care or mind that we had hair in our food :( so gross.
4669,Lots of furry friends to socialize with.
4670,Nice
4671,It's IHOP there's seldom a suprise there.
4672,Great Hot food deli.
4673,Convenient location and friendly staff...
4674,I rescued a beautiful cat from this shelter about two years ago and it was the best decision I've ever made. Sherry (manager at the time) made the experience amazing and gave us all the needed information to make sure we took the right steps raising our cat correctly. Just because a cat is an adult doesn't mean they don't deserve love as much as kittens. Visit the adult cats and just see for yourself how amazing those souls are.
4675,A little pricey and sure wish it had a much better underbody wash since the winters here are really rough especially for cars.  But still the best car wash in town thou.
4676,Beautiful scenery and a great walk during the summer.  A definite must see while in Anchorage.
4677,"We eat at Red Robin fairly regularly (one of our favorite date or family night restaurants). The food has always been great (we've tried a fair portion of the menu), the atmosphere is fairly lively, and we have never had any issues with service either. Definitely recommend."
4678,Pricey.
4679,I had a great experience working with Issac. He stuck with me getting what I wanted from Toyota. We had good communication during the process and he took care of me during the sale and since. I would highly recommend to others!
4680,Good tools on sale
4681,Excellent
4682,"The captain cook is a mid century hotel that is able to still compete with modern hotels.  The decor and ambiance work for the theme throughout.  Rooms are generally spacious.  Tower arrangement is interesting, but lends itself to drawing you through the available shops and amenities.  Covid restrictions are followed and they have staff at each entrance.  Parking is not part of hotel, so plan around that.  Room service menu is robust and provided through the hotel restaurant, Fletcher's."
4683,Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.
4684,"From forests to tide pools, ever changing and such a wonderful walk for exploration and solace. One of Juneau's many treasures."

4690,"Solid 4 star for 3 Star hotel. Rooms are clean. Registration area is very clean and staffed by friendly people. In addition, there is a binder with one page summaries for several restaurants in the Anchorage area. Nice touch for out of town guests. The breakfast area offers all you can eat breakfast of sausage,  eggs. Waffles, biscuits and gravy along with beverages of OJ, apply juice and milk. We had good view from our room."

4695,Great place to get whatcha need in bulk if you are a member.
4696,"The coffee is outstanding and the service excellent! Choose your method of brewing and savor the flavors. I‚Äôve enjoyed their coffee at other locations for years, so am thrilled that they have opened a caf√© in midtown / Spenard area. Good treats to go with your brew, and a direct connection to the tasty Sweet Caribou next door!"
4697,I work here üíó
4698,Excellent food and staff. Don't let appearance fool you.
4699,They're special sauce on the Mushroom Swiss burger is delicious. I haven't had a burger in a while and I am glad I tried this one. I will definitely be back.
4700,"Haircut and highlights were ok. Took 4 hours to get it done which was very frustrating. Sitting in a chair for a half hour while someone just touches your hair. Then when I go to pay, I was told that the highlights that I asked for which are advertised as 40 dollars are actually color all over... not highlights. I asked for and got highlights, but paid double the advertised price.  I'm not going back"
4701,you need something walmart has it from tackle to food entertainment and more low prices friendly helpful staff
4702,Great friendly service & I know the food is always delicious & the drinks are perfect!
4703,Food was cold.  Server  were great
4704,Gorgeous views.
4705,"Revising down to one star based on this weeks experience. We are moving out of state and needed a travel certificate. Vet had recommended a teeth cleaning so we thought to do both at the same time.   When we dropped her off they recommended medicines at the same time because we were moving down south without disclosing the price.  The bill was over $700 all told.  And there was a lot of contradictions over when to cease feeding her prior to flying, which is tonight.  The cleaning was yesterday which they say will be fine and we are very much hoping it will be.  We are very unhappy with this experience."
4706,"Good food, wait staff was great"
4707,"I mean, it's Gamestop. Gets cramped fairly easy, especially around the time of new releases, but it's got a fair bit of everything video game, and I've always been met with smiles from friendly staff. If you want something, they either have it or know who does. Worth visiting if you're interested in picking up some games or game-related stuff."
4708,Love the Szechuan Mongolian bowls!
4709,Extremely friendly and helpful staff along with beautiful fabrics!

4724,Lots of trails dog friendly very beautiful scenery. Lots of parking and pedestrian crossing
4725,"Good American food, daily specials"
4726,"Pretty accessible airport in Fairbanks.  Check in is relatively easy, and security fairly smooth.  If you arrive early then getting in and through is quick.  There is a Starbucks, an overpriced restaurant, and a gift/sundries store.  Make sure you buy your souvenirs in town and 2/3 less for them.  Embarking and debating is easy as well.  Parking is good, a little less expensive than a major metropolitan area but nonetheless still pricey.  Plenty of travel options as well, taxis line up for the arriving flights and Uber and Lyft will come as well."
4727,What i expected out mc's very good
4728,About what you expect for a neighborhood bar and grill
4729,Nice little cafe at the train station. They also had a deli counter.
4730,Went pretty fast. Cashier was slow and I was first car in line. Food was super timely and good. I thought my nuggets were greasier than I remember in the past.
4731,Great fish tacos and even better homemade habanero sauce !!!!!
4732,Workers here suck walked around for 30 min looking for someone to help no one. Went to Loews had 5 people help me right when I got to the door
4733,"Very nice restaurant, well kept and clean. The staff are super friendly and attentive. Food was excellent for the price. Would strongly suggest this spot for lunch or dinner."
4734,"Same as it always is. Basically zero customer service. People are rude there.
Online order pickup lady was rude on the phone. Called to tell me they were out of something and asked if the substitution was fine. I said yes and then she hung up on me. Seriously that's how the conversation went.
I went in to pick it up, but first I had to pick up a few additional things. Walked past several employees, none of which asked if I needed help. I didn't, but what if I did? Even attempted to look a little lost by a couple to see. Nope. Nothing.

I have horrible experiences with Home Depots in Anchorage. Only went here because what I needed Lowe's doesn't have.
1/10. Will not go back."
4735,"A cozy bookstore with shelves full of decently priced new and used books. The owner is very friendly and hosts events from time to time. It there is a book not there, it can be ordered. The owner also stocks some novelty items, as well as vinyls."
4736,"Best/biggest breakfast burrito in town, friendly service.
Undeniably busy, be prepared to wait 10+ minutes just to get to the window, wanted something a little more bitter from a sludge cup, but still good coffee.
Will be back for sure"
4737,"Corned beef and cabbage -- cabbage was stringy, tough; carrots were still hard; beef was tasty.   Carrot cake was disappointing.  Bread pudding was very good.  Ice cream was melting upon delivery, as if the bowl were hot."
4738,"Pittsburgh owner ! Go pens !
Loved the pizza. Great staff.
good options !"
4739,I love their strawberry lemonade!
4740,Serving sizes have shrunk over the years. Menu needs Abit of an overhaul.
4741,"brad makes Thursday night football that much better, and he's only at the farm... food is great, drinks are always good and the staff is friendly.  meet friends here for any sporting event televised and you'll have a good time. we had a dodge ball championship on the booth tv and atl v Philly on all the other screens. it was sweet"

4750,Friendly Staff. Good hours. Nice and fun experience.
4751,Changed out my tires here. Quick and easy! Very nice staff.
4752,"A fun, quick little hike; really great views on a clear day. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was how narrow the boardwalk is; it‚Äôs not really wide enough for two people to walk side by side."
4753,Pretty good pizza fast delivery nice people
4754,We love the food! Vegetable ramen is excellent. 3 of our kids love the cheese ramen. The crunch rolls are some of the best in town. My son had to have Naruto for dinner for his birthday. Thanks for the wonderful meal.

4757,Helpful and friendly
4758,I absolutely love the cinnamon rolls
4759,"Christine was knowledgeable, professional, and didn't prod me into a more expensive mattress. I had a price range and she showed me options--- insisted I actually lie on  the bed to test it in the positions I sleep. With a pillow. She answered my questions clearly, explaining sometimes in different ways so I understood better. Who knew buying a ""bed"" was more than just a mattress. She made it easy. I had already been to other places. So, I could compare. Finally the store is clean, nicely lighted. No dust bunnies or bits  of paper scattered about on the floor. And it smelled clean. Not cloroxy clean or flowery or warehouse-y. Just fresh. Masks were worn by all. Sanitized pens were provided. And, we kept a nice social distaI highly recommend Ultimate Mattress Store. Delivery and assembly are available as well."
4760,"These people are so friendly, I have finally settled in and order a salad now and it has really helped my weight loss.  Nice & clean, great service, friendly smiles, and good food....what better?"
4761,"Spenards (""SBS"" by the locals) is an Alaskan building supply company. They have multiple locations across Alaska and two right off KBeach road only a few miles apart. They carry most everything a contractor would need. They are friendly and usually know how to help you on the project you're working on. Their main work appears to be with contractors. Their prices are a little higher than the large construction corporations such as Home Depot but it is much quicker/easier to find help and the advice is often accurate."
4762,Great and friendly employees
4763,"The atmosphere is fun and the staff is cool, but the food isn't really the greatest"
4764,Love their food. Friendly staff. Kid friendly.
4765,"Best location for metal doors, wood doors and windows!"
4766,Who doesn't enjoy a State Park. You'll enjoy it. I promise.
4767,As close to Mexico you can get this far North
4768,"It was good, will return"
4769,So much fun. My son and girlfriend loved it also. Please support this amazing place. Lots to learn and be amazed by looking at.
4770,Great store.. Extremely helpful assistants...  REALLY...
4771,"Great shop, very helpful people, keep up the good work!"
4772,Friendly and helpful
4773,"Theh have it all. Furniture, clothes, groceries, sporting goods, clothes,  hardware, and garden."
4774,"SPICY PEANUT WINGS!!! I cannot say enough good things about this place. The sauce on the wings is the best sauce I‚Äôve ever had. I also had the clam chowder (A+) and a chipotle chicken panini. Great sized portions, excellent food all around."
4775,"Excellent service, mundane food for the price."
4776,"3 people behind the counter failed to even acknowledge my existence for about 2 minutes, but once I was eventually helped they made my keys quickly and for a fair price."
4777,Great breakfast spot! Delicious lattes.
4778,"I bring my co-workers from  rural Alaska here bc it's a favorite of theirs and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food is. We've had great service and we've had mediocre service, hence the 3 stars. one thing to watch for if you're in a group is that they add a tip on to your bill. I accept responsibility for not having my glasses on and not paying closer attention to our bill, but I wound up tipping 20% on top of the bill that had already included the tip. I waited tables all through college and I never would have let a party leave the restaurant without bringing that to their attention. I paid with a local credit card so it would also have been easy to give me a call and check, especially since the service during this particular visit was not great (long wait for additional drinks, forgotten plate for the child, and a forgotten side dish, plus a long wait to get served in the first place) . I'd be a little more forgiving if they were slammed that night but they weren't even that busy. So, I was pretty disturbed by that."
4779,It is a very activities oriented relaxing resort. It is a destination resort and the end of the road however just so you know ahead of time.
4780,They have a something for everyone. N the poke is good too!!
4781,Excellent food
4782,I didn't visit this store 3 weeks ago. But I have had food from straight out of philly & it was excellent!!!!!
4783,Awesome food and great service.
4784,"On the plus side, there is a nice variety of food options from salads and sandwiches,  to pizza and corn fritters. Some items on the menu are better than others, some taste rather generic and seems like they pulled it out of a freezer, nuked it, and said enjoy!

My suggestion, good spot for a beer and to order some appetizers -plenty of TVs to catch some sports."
4785,Is a one Stop shop for everything that you need for hunting and fishing
4786,Solid company.
4787,Locals and old souls only.
4788,It's kind of like Chipotle if you miss that from the lower 48.
4789,Good food
4790,Love the people who work there!
4791,It's a fair same thing same spot every year nothing changes
4792,Ok
4793,"While the food is very good,  Over the last few years the amount of time to get food delivered plus the amount of incorrect items has turned me off. Tonight I called at 730 and had not recieved my food by 9pm. Their call center couldnt find my order and told me they would call back. I live right by the tudor center restaurant and he told me he sent my order the the A street store because tudor didnt have a driver. By 910 I just drove to the Tudor store and explained my situations. It took them 5 min to make my food. AND now I know why. Nobody seems to be listening because i ordered an adobada burrito combo and when i got home it was just the meat with the flour tortillas which I thought was for the soup I ordered. The driver calls me at almost 9:20 pm to confirm my address which also was completely wrong. The last few times my drinks were not in my order.  Even some of the menus are not even the same on the internet. I couldnt even refind my choice on another menu page. At this point I might as well just make my own. It's too much of a hassle especially with credit cards involved."
4794,Best breakfast in Anchorage
4795,Very clean very lovely facility
4796,Very peaceful. Nice walking area for you and your mutt. Take in nature. Cool activities that are hosted there. It's worth checking out
4797,"Good food, descent prices"
4798,"Great fair, a little small but clean nice and good food"
4799,Great place for breakfast. Fresh ingredients and super friendly. Locals really come here. Highly recommended but be prepared for a wait. Counter seating is first come first served.
4800,This place is really something Soldotna was missing.  It is so delicious and freshly made on site daily.   Awesome!!
4801,"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in town. Not only is the food so delicious that I will consume it to the point my stomach will no longer stretch, but the owner/head chef is terrific and made sure my whole family was taken care of; he brought extra plate of food for my kids at no cost. I will definitely be a regular at this establishment. The pricing is very reasonable as well."
4802,beautiful picnic area
4803,Great store
4804,Beautiful walk and views
4805,"Delicious, quick service, friendly staff."
4806,Better than Burger King on northern  lights
4807,Excellent food and the service was even better. I sat at the bar üòç
4808,Good mall. Many different shops!
4809,great food and entertainment
4810,They don't deliver to south side
4811,"Let me start off with the staff is super friendly. The environment when you walk in is a bit on the aged side but it's a bowling alley and all the lanes work flawlessly so can't complain too much. There is a full bar with plenty of pitcher options. Food was pretty good and seating at the lanes was ample. A strike against this establishment is definitely the choice of balls. Poor selection of sizes and weights. Also the game room could use swap out the pay for toys machines for actual games like Pac-Man or pinball etc. Back on the positives, the lanes were well waxed didn't have any issues with any of my bowls curving too early due to an unwaxed lane. The manager was very helpful in assisting with ensuring I had the lanes I needed for the large group of people I hosted  15+. Will definitely be returning soon thanks a lot EAGLE RIVER BOWL."
4812,The best (also the only) glass blowing and general glass working place around!  If you are planning to go in there for the first time plan ahead and give yourself a couple hours extra because you will want to see all the exceptional and wonderful pieces of glass art that they have to offer!
4813,This place has a wonderful staff. They were very knowledgeable about the anchorage area with the questions I had in regards to gear. The prices aren‚Äôt cheap though.
4814,Good selection of pies
4815,So my cousin stayed at this hotel for the past two nights and the lady at the desk tried to charge me $10 for visiting him all day and then leaving at night and then when I told her I didn't spend the night she tried to say I don't trust you very disrespectful very rude I think next time my cousin is going to stay somewhere else and the lady's name was Sarah at the front desk I will definitely speaking to the manager tomorrow morning

4820,Big mall!
4821,"Love all the different areas, only walked around some of the many loops, changing rts etc. for about 2 miles with our old dog.  Soon to return!"
4822,So so when you have the money
4823,Really good fine dining at casual dining prices.
4824,"Outstanding day! Moose had his close up moments and two Bald Eagles showed up; one bathed in the stream for at least 25 minutes and left, as the second eagle flew and swooped around hunting for small game for quite a while. Very close to the City and completely wheelchair accessible, save for a few muddy trails. Boardwalk is disabled accessible most of the year, at times of no snow  all year round.  Bring a picnic and blanket and make your friends and family jealous as all hell!"
4825,"I was in one of the bathrooms and a man opened the door, we stared at one another for a moment then I said ""hey hows it going"" He started to close the door but i stopped him and said ""Im done, your good"" and hes just like ""ok"". That has to be my best airport experience. 5/5 would do again."
4826,"Nice opportunity to learn the history of the founding of Fairbanks. Plenty of parking and a nice, short walk on a paved path."
4827,Very cool
4828,"Great first visit! Dr. Gulley and her staff explained the procedure, my options, and the risks. I am very happy with how we are proceeding."
4829,"The Cadillac deep dish pizza. It takes a good 45 minutes after you order it but it is well worth the wait. I would recommend add extra pineapple as I like it on every bite. Also it is a very nice environment so the time will pass by super fast and then the pizza will come in no time :) the server who helped us was really nice and professional, kept enough distance but always making sure we were fully satisfied!"
4830,Cost so much to ship a item
4831,Very knowledgeable and helpful staff
4832,Great family fun
4833,Many of the same friendly faces still there from 5 years ago. Live stock feed that I can't find anywhere else in the interior. Grain free dog food though not competitive in price.
4834,Great food!!
4835,"Amazing rain forest like atmosphere in ALASKA! huge trees, plants, mountains, brown bears."
4836,"Loooove the vibe these guys are going for! Total mini vacation every time I come thru! Hawaii (obviously) themed, chill music playing, budtenders have always impressed me with their product knowledge and intelligent conversation. the flower they grow is on point (that shiva sativa tho!!!) never disappointed! Pakalolo is a must when your in Fairbanks!"
4837,Good deals and great customer service
4838,"Type of place you could find some good deals, but it's small and really have to sift through everything they have to find the right item."
4839,It has been a long year but eating here again is like none of the bad things ever happened! The staff is on point! The food is AMAZING! Pus the environment is warm and welcoming as it's always been!
4840,They had what I was looking for

4842,Beautiful and peaceful
4843,"Sara is a great instructor,  I'm not artistic at all,  but my paintings look pretty close to what it's ""supposed"" to look likeü§£"
4844,Good place to watch movies especially on Tuesday where it is half price all day
4845,Not a bad place to stay for a night and pretty reasonable
4846,"The nature rock springs are almost magical with their therapy. Feeling sore?  Soaking for an hour will change that. You can save $5 per towel if you bring your own, and I highly recommend bringing a bottle of water, but make sure it's plastic because glass isn't allowed in the rock springs due to safety concerns."
4847,Best gyro's in town.
4848,Best staff in town
4849,Better than army food more often than not
4850,Sweet little lady had procedure done on her ear. Fantastic staff! Not too costly
4851,"Great location within easy walking distance of town centre. The room was spacious, clean and relatively cheap. Staff were always friendly and tried to be helpful.
We watched a rather bizarre interaction between another guest and front desk staff, where the guest enquired about rather basic tourist information. It turned out the staff could offer little insight into tourist attractions around Fairbanks and couldn't even offer any tourist brochures! Perhaps it had something to do with the extensive renovations that had closed the regular front desk?
Don't plan sleeping in on Sunday if you want a complimentary breakfast. Served between 6.30 and 8.30 am only and after that you pay.
Also note that the walls are not particularly soundproof. Fortunately I travel with earplugs."
4852,Pretty nice little campground. Little playground there for your kids. Next to a beautiful creek.
4853,I inadvertently lost an envelope with cash in it and a lot of employees searched the store for me! My cash was found and I'm very grateful! Such a sweet staff and they all seem to really care. The employees also seem relaxed and like they're happy to work there.

4858,Friendly staff and a great company to flu with
4859,"Chicken chipotle was really great! Creamy, tender, spicy, plenty. There are other original items on the menu for the adventurous, as well as  standards for those who like consistency.  The decor is pretty authentic too, if it matters. But it is a little expensive."
4860,Fun place to stay for the novelty.
4861,"Nice people, & a nice store.  Prices are pretty good."
4862,Good happy servers but they mix up ur order but it's a great place to meet family.

4868,"Great service, staff was very friendly! Got me in quickly and for a good price."

4876,The carne asada tacos were delicious!!!
4877,Great service. Yalls boy Ronny needs a promotion.
4878,"Amazing mom and pop type diner. They are a cash only, tiny and cozy, rustic-esque breakfast gem. I haven't even tried anything else besides breakfast in the 3 years I've visited, but I'm sure it's not bad.

I'm from North Carolina, and they have grits y'all. :) Not runny OR undercooked, it's a southern miracle in an artic wonderland."
4879,Best food for 20 miles in any direction.  Get there and try the best.
4880,This is a take out pizza place. If you are looking for a place to sit and have lunch or dinner this is not the place.   The pizza is great otherwise.   Customer service was so so.  The prices is also ok we shared a medium pizza with a can of soda for $10.
4881,I love this place. I have taken all of our family pets here for spay/neuter and vaccines.
4882,"Lovely hike through the woods to a beautiful gushing waterfall on Memorial Day 2018.
Short but rewarding hike. Must be able to climb over roots and a little rough terrain."
4883,"Hubby and I had breakfast here before flying back to Barrow. We got to meet the owner who has been using the same pie recipes that the original owner did. Good sized portions and very filling!
My only complaint is that the country gravy was a little bland.
Other then that...amazing!"

4889,Who doesn't love good donuts!
4890,This bar is a Seward landmark.  Virtually unchanged for decades.
4891,Hit and miss. Most the time ok. Eat what you serve. Flavorless tomatoes at times. Too much tortilla guys fill those things.
4892,"I found what I went for, staff was helpful and professional, price was good. That's a 5 üåü experience"
4893,Servers are great. Food is good. Hostess was painfully rude but the manger put her in her place. So overall...not a bad way to spend an evening.
4894,Quickly being ruined by California  Instagrammers and Chinese foreigners with absolutely no situational awareness and common courtesy for other people in the area. TURN OFF YOU F@(#$ CAR LIGHTS AND FLASHLIGHTS!
4895,The food was very good and they donate a percentage of their earnings to the first responders/fire department. The people were so nice and it didn't take long at all for it all being made right their in front of you
4896,Friendly staff and good food
4897,"So many yummy things to eat here. The nachos are an excellent choice to start with or a hefty meal for 1. Follow that up with a pizza, of course. The eggplant parmesan pizza is unique and super tasty. Lots of great Alaska microbrews on tap as well."
4898,Never disappointed!
4899,Dispatch was rude. Mister if you don't like your job then quit cause someone else wants it I'm sure
4900,"Wings are ok. Great customer service. Probably won't eat there again, but it was not disgusting."
4901,Very professional staff and very caring about your comfort level. Highly recommended!
4902,Best comfort food around! This is the regular place for me and my family to grab some lunch and spend time. I recommend going at least once just for the salsa bar! Try the chicken chipotle burro for something unique with  mouth watering flavor!!
4903,Good prices.
4904,Family fun
4905,It's a nice place but please understand that it's close to a 2 hour drive to Denali national park.
4906,Loved shopping
4907,Nice trail in the woods good for a quick walk or some fishing
4908,"Manager was rude a few times, haven‚Äôt been back since."
4909,Produce is always fresh when I shop there.
4910,Such amazing bar food always down for a burger and beer at the imperial!
4911,Great place and view
4912,Expensive for what you get
4913,The old Kenai mall been going there since I was a kid... The Kenai mall used to be a lot of little stores in there now it's where the   unappointment office is there now.. Add a Barber shop there.. And you could rent a place in front if you have a big event going on...
4914,Some really good fat burgers.
4915,A great Park to hangout at or to attend Protests.
4916,"What an exceptional place, best drinking chocolate we've had.  Relaxing atmosphere,
Tricky to find but we'll worth it."
4917,"I'm finally getting around to this review, so I apologize on the timing of it!  On Memorial Day weekend, we were driving our new 33 ft. camper that we bought that Friday out for its first ""glamping"" trip.  Being new to the ""glamping"" life, as we were heading down from our home on Hillside, we started to smell our brakes.  We learned about brake controller's that day and that it was an additional piece of equipment needed to control brakes on the camper.  Of course, being a Holiday weekend, either the stores with brake controllers were not open or they didn't have the wiring harness needed for a Toyota truck.  We called everyone to include the Valley.  Oddly, I tried U-Haul (which I thought wouldn't even sell them) and a lady confirmed that they had 1 left.  When we arrived, Greg greeted us, helped us locate his LAST Toyota wiring harness, and even provided tools and guided us through the installation.  He was extremely helpful, empathized with our situation, and made our weekend turn out to wonderful..instead of what would have otherwise been a big foil in our plans.  I highly recommend this location for your towing, truck rental, moving and storage needs based on the customer service alone!!!!"
4918,Delicious!  My son took me on a lunch date here and we will be coming back again soon
4919,"The new location is great, and the food is yummy as always."
4920,Bartender friendly.  Crowd was having wonderful time.  Sports on.  Awesome outside smoke area with horse shoes.
4921,"U.S / America s
Favorite  chain.or 1 of em also my go to"
4922,Had tapes and it was wonderful!
4923,They seem to have more items on stock then many other stores in our area since covid hit us.
4924,Great coffee and tea and a variety of foods that were unexpected while delicious.
4925,"This is a beautifully constructed hotsprings pool. It looks like a natural pool surrounded by rocks, unlike the pools like Miette in Jasper that look like a swimming pool. It is about 1.3hours drive from Fairbanks. Watch out for moose is you drive yourself. Take bug spray with you, the mosquitoes there are just hungry for a piece of you."
4926,Awesome spot!
4927,Excellent pizza!
4928,"Food was 4 stars but the service we received for our group of 7 was very poor. They have a built in gratuity for parties that large so I guess our server didn't feel she needed to put in any effort. Cold food, entrees brought out 30 minutes apart and couldn't even get a water refill till the very end of dinner. Would definitely rethink going back there."
4929,On my bucket list...  done...
4930,Pretty standard Walmart. Subway attached.
4931,Carr's Safeway a Good Family Store!
4932,Service was a little slow food was hot and tasty
4933,"Place needs a good cleaning. There was trash on the floor. Walked beside the cashier to use the restroom noticed her playing on her phone. Maybe that's what she is supposed to be doing, but I always heard "" time to lean, time to clean"". My girlfriend came back from also using the restroom to comment on the lack of cleanliness. The standards have really been slipping."
4934,4 stars instead of 5 for the design of the seating in the theaters. It's not stadium seating. But this is a nice theater to watch movies that have been shown already in the new release theaters at a much cheaper rate.
4935,"Fun space. Good dogs playing outside by the fire pit. BYO board games or cards- they can't provide any per their license.

Awesome rotating brews that go fast."
4936,üòÑüòÑüòÑ
4937,"This McDonald's is OK, the other one is cleaner, faster, and has a better play area for the kids but, sometimes this one is just so much more convenient."
4938,This is a local park with a baseball diamond next to ACF church. They have big benches and do many local events.
4939,Very decent food according to the price that you are paying for.
4940,Asked for a cheese burger with tomato and ketchup only and ended up with everything on it and onion rings we're over cooked
4941,"Great food, cute restaurant on ocean front, great staff, good variety"
4942,"Very friendly staff, beautiful atmosphere and great food!! HIGHLY recommend!!"
4943,Amazingly Awesome!
4944,Great food got it out quickly and was very friendly 10/10 would recommend
4945,"Welcoming and helpful staff. Kid friendly, and they have adult and child classes for reasonable prices for a few hours of time which is a big bonus to me. I love giving my kid an oppirtunity to be creative and make something for a relative and this is a good outlet for it.

The pottery options include both seasonal and more generic options. Pottery is fired on site and they contact you for pickup on completion."
4946,My friends  use this facility.  Had to stay longer  with my dog. They took me in quickly  for travel  health check. Friendly  group.
4947,"Quick work, dude at the front desk knew what he was talking about. The tires were cheap and the labor was too. Tires are balanced well too against my terrible alignment! All around fantastic service."
4948,"Great pizza, great baklava. Authentic baklava too"
4949,Great food and service
4950,Cheap place too eat give more when you volunteer.
4951,Nice
4952,So sketch. Had to wander everywhere to find anything. Strange layout. Decent selection for size.
4953,"When I want a burger, this is where I go."
4954,"I don't do electronic, I smoke cigs but my friend let me try one of her disposables and when I wanted one she swore on this place because she used to have a mod & likes this place so much.

I was nervous going in because I don't know anything about vapes or e-cigs and when I explained my situation the staff was so informative, helpful, and chill about helping me find what I wanted. My first visit I even signed up for their rewards program ü§™"
4955,Good Selection Friendly Service
4956,Excellent restaurant. Terrific view. Good service. Love the food!!
4957,The Best sandwiches and quick breads.
4958,Beautiful place and efficiently organised. Rooms are good clean bathrooms. Good plugs though not at the nightstand.
4959,"Their piercers are amazing, friendly and precise."
4960,Great selection
4961,Walked in with no appointment and had my tires swapped out in 15minutes for 15 per tire. A+
4962,"Food was good.  Service was quite lack luster.  No waters served, over 12 minutes before someone even acknowledged that were were there.

Had to ask twice for condiments, and was 90% done with my food by the time they were delivered.  3/10, might go back."
4963,Unreliable tire service
4964,"Worked at Cooper Landing two summers. Made it a point to drive to Sterling just to eat at Magpye's.
Excellent !! Well worth the drive !!"
4965,The nicest large scale hotel in town.  Legends and tales circulate how Snoop dog rents out the entire floor when he's in town. To smoke the sticky icky.
4966,"So this place has been a lunch spot for my wife and I for years to the point where I felt obligated to only go there out of loyalty. I never complained about the dry sandwiches or wilted lettuce in the salad or even the sub par service from a select few of the waitstaff. (don't get me wrong the staff is good for most part just a few bad apples that forget to put customer service 1st) We'll today my wife ordered me a tuna sandwich to go, I cam I picked the sandwich the lady had a little attitude but understandable I was the one who ordered the sandwich but was picking it up while my wife got her nails done. A few mins after picking m y sandwich up my wife was done with her nail appointment I asked if she wanted lunch as well she said yeah I want some soup from perfect cup. We walked over to the perfect cup and we took a seat like always the lady proceeded to come over and tell us that because we cant eat here because we had a to go order sandwich even though my wife wanted to order a soup for herself to eat. I am absolutely applaud with the way this went down and to make a long story a little shorter my wife and I will have to start a new tradition because we will never go to the NOT SO PERFECT CUP again."
4967,Good gas prices
4968,Friendly staff and always nice.
4969,"Good food, a little pricey, service is a bit slow."
4970,Prompt and polite service!
4971,"Has just the basics, prices are reasonable for being that far north"
4972,Great friendly service good pizza
4973,This is the first place I ever had Indian food and it was a love at first sight.
4974,Good
4975,Nice place to camp in a beautiful river not far away
4976,love the employees!!
4977,"I like the location, but the assistant mgr Pena, has much to be desired, as a customer service employee. It's very obvious that she does not like her job. When you're standing there watching one employee handle a line full of people at the CS desk, you would think you might pitch in & help, instead of leaning against the counter, while we waited in line for 17 minutes, to get a refund on items we were overcharged for, at check out. Carr's/Safeway should send you a fruit basket, as a thank you for helping customers decide to shop with them instead."
4978,Overcrowded.  Only went there to meet up with the fishing guide.
4979,"Sad salads here, won‚Äôt touch them. I never know what I‚Äôm going to get when I order a pizza from here, but it‚Äôs certainly never fresh. I recommend going north on the Glenn Hwy for two minutes longer from here for a better pie."
4980,"Awesome!  Hot Yoga was amazing, coded lockers, towels, shampoo, conditioner and body wash smells great too after all that head to toe sweating...lol"
4981,Poor customer service! My sister had a sushi roll and there was hair in the roll. Waitress didn't apologize and was not nice until we were leaving. I asked for hot sauce and the chef then put about a third of a bottle on the rolls. It was soaked and disgusting.
4982,Bobby gave me my first pedicure ever. I was so relaxed. Jade did my full set. Absolutely a delight and my nails are perfect.
4983,"im going yesday
daovady vilavanh"
4984,Mostly closed due to winter. But breathtaking winter wonderland.
4985,Love there milkshakes
4986,Great food and excellent service!
4987,Always good at Mickey ds

4989,"Excellent accommodation. Friendly staff, well appointed rooms."
4990,It was awesome
4991,Great products and service
4992,Call of the wild
4993,Always have a good meal.
4994,This location charges a dollar more than other locations and yet doesn't provide the same service. Paid for a $16 car wash and didn't receive the double rinse or spot-free rinse. Love Bubbles all over my car which dried and stained. I will not return to this car wash until the owners stop being cheap
4995,Can find interesting items at great deals.
4996,First time eating Thai food. OMG!! Totally Freaking Delicious. Love the sweet and sour!
4997,"(Translated by Google) Very good food and excellent attention from the work staff

(Original)
Muy buena la comida y excelentes atenciones del personal de trabajo"
4998,There car in the middle of the store is beautiful and rare. There prices are way way way too high for average souvenirs. Go to the Homer spitb instead.

5000,Gres th selection
5001,"Beautiful Tours, helpful ship staff"
5002,Awesome
5003,busy place. super nice

5007,I love cards better than Walmart
5008,Really nice clean place!
5009,"Good prices,"
5010,A great place to go for drinks and karaoke or whatever is going on. I have been going here for years. Love seeing the regulars. We all know each other.  Layer back and great atmosphere.
5011,Always a 5 star.  Always.
5012,The food was good and so was the service.
5013,Great sandwiches!
5014,Recently watched Angel Has Fallen and it was greatüëçüèæ
5015,All of it's a wonderful place.
5016,"The nicest gravel pit around. Fishing year round, ice skating on city mopped tracks. Central shortcuts to neighborhood nodes."
5017,Lots of hills but a great view when you make it down to the falls.  I'm kind of chubby but I made it okay
5018,Yummy food in a pretty cool atmosphere
5019,Over priced rude staff. Giving us dirty looks
5020,"Great food, great atmosphere!"
5021,"Only stayed overnight, but what time we did spend there all the staff was very polite."
5022,Usually 5 stars but they were very busy and food seemed like it sat a bit before they called our number.
5023,"Staff were friendly and knowledgable, small gift shop, clean facilities."
5024,Just another quick stop. All went well. The cashier followed my instructions and was pleasant.
5025,Awesome vodka
5026,Build your own burritos with a good selection of items. Prices are decent for the size you get.
5027,Go see it.
5028,"Great food, Halibut, clam chowder and burgers. A good place to stop to eat."
5029,Need a good manager here. Chicken good.
5030,The pizza was great. Breakfast was lacking and way over priced for what you get.
5031,"Was I absolutly blown away by food and atmosphere? Naw. BUT this place is really good. If the weather is nice you can sit outside by the creek. Beer on tap is always good, and the food goes just right with the beer. Also, one of the better places to catch up on sports or tv shows with friends."
5032,Very clean store. Friendly workers. Great selection of baby items
5033,Get outdoors and explore this magnificent area!
5034,They have a lot of stuff and answers for you . Just ask!
5035,Awesome fun! Just the right amount of challenge. Super friendly staff. Well maintained building and room!
5036,"Very knowledgeable staff, always friendly with a wide selection of products, and an ever growing inventory."
5037,Great place for souvenirs
5038,Love this place. They are always fast and efficient. Very courteous as well. I also appreciate the $10 haircut deals
5039,It was good. If I left this review after we walked out that night it would have been four stars but unfortunately I waited and now I am biased by other experiences. The atmosphere was nice with live piano. The wait staff was good. The food was good. It was just good. It‚Äôs a good place to go. I thought the prices were a bit high.
5040,"Friendly service, but it was not super fast. The restaurant was not very busy when I went Monday morning. Good food, pretty average prices overall. If I recall correctly, it was $3.99 for a glass of orange juice, which seemed a bit high though."
5041,Delicious donuts and helpful staff. So many choices.
5042,"I went in an hour before it was closing and it wasn't busy at all. The food came out fast and cooked to order. Nothing to special about the place, just a quick bit to eat that is family oriented. Customer service was great, and took care of me whenever I needed something. Very decently priced foods."
5043,"It's the McDonald's of hardware and lumber. The location is convenient with good parking. They have tons of inventory, however, there are times when I'm not in the mood to wander around 1,000,000 square feet of big box. I mostly wind up here when AIH is closed or a smaller joint doesn't have what I'm after."
5044,"Really awesome people work here, super friendly staff with a great knowledge of the types strains what that is what this is üòÉ just go here if your looking for some super chronic fair prices."
5045,Great food and service
5046,"The treats there were great and hits the spot on for the sweet cravings, but the service, was really cold and unwelcoming... we do all the work making our own, which is great... but for a cashier that is cold and sour attitude, should not expect a tip, especially after witnessing her snapping at some kids for not putting the handle all the way up on the ice cream machine."
5047,Consistently good food and service. Great atmosphere.
5048,"Friendly people, clean, inexpensive, big portions, fast and fresh. Very tasty."
5049,"The friendly atmosphere,  excellent servers and service, EXCELLENT QUALITY FOOD"
5050,Best coffee place in town. Great atmosphere and experienced baristas.
5051,Got to see Danali and lots of animals. Loved it
5052,Always a great place to take the family.
5053,"It was the Best experience, you should try it."
5054,"Many restaurant options, large capacity movie theater that includes IMax, retail shopping, department store options, warehouse membership and home builders supply chains."
5055,Not bad
5056,Very fun park! It also has a skate park which is really nice. They recently added new equipment and it also has baseball fields.
5057,"Great campsite. Water not the best for swimming though due to soft bottom, a few leeches... Stay in the boat?"
5058,"The band (The Stack) was really good, pretty nice local bar, rum and coke was a bit strong but other than that i would reccomend coming and checking it out."
5059,After a hike I was looking for substantial food. The cauliflower elotes and salad were nice. The chicken and waffles arrived and I knew I had two meals. I enjoyed it all.
5060,"With all the different phones, options, features and mods available these days, traversing the cell phone seas takes a knowledgeable skipper. Tessa was just that. She helped us in a number of ways and was incredibly patient and always had a cheery smile. I cannot say enough about her a d the positive attitude. At the time of this writing the AT&T store bathroom was broken so be sure to go first or you may need to visit coldstone..."
5061,I travel hundreds of miles out of my way to get their halibut. Worth. Every. Mile.
5062,Good food and great staff.
5063,"Washed my car, the weather immediately turn to shyt and now my car is covered in Brown gunk. Isn't that the rule when you wash your car?ü§£üò±üòñ
I will say that when the car wash was done my car looked bright and shiny, for just $10"
5064,"Quick little in and out place. There's a drive through. Not much space if there are people waiting inside. You can stand and wait for your order. The workers aren't always super attentive, it's kind of hit and miss, and I personally don't care for the taste of the crust... Kind of stale. But that might just be me. Nice for a quick pizza though, since we don't have a Little Caesar's here in Fairbanks. Not the cheapest, but you can walk in, grab cheesy italian bread and a pepperoni pizza for under 20 dollars in less than 5 minutes."
5065,Best and biggest Freddys in state.
5066,Good supplies n alot of options
5067,I love Honda and their service is fantastic.
5068,Great service
5069,"Great prices, nice professional staff."
5070,"Amazing burgers and fries, the shakes are too loaded with stuff"
5071,Great selection. Reasonably priced and we liked the decor.
5072,Good stuff
5073,Really enjoyed the meals they offer here..
5074,Great glacier trip! The stuff are really nice. Allow some time to find another parking lot as the parking lot here is always full before the cruise leaves.
5075,These people took time to show us how to have a good time while learning the Curling basics
5076,"Heavenly 8 Pre-Roll deal is LIT!!!  Thanks

-Chris Bird"
5077,"Very good and established restaurant. Nice menu offerings. Noted Bakery items, good reputation for quality. Since I am not a Pastry fan, can only say that baking items look and smell great!"
5078,Good store with helpful personnel although the prices are a little higher than some of the other stores but they have a good selection of what I was looking for which was Automotive high temperature spray paint
5079,"Great service as always.  There were four of us and our waitress was always checking on us, other support staff were always helping."
5080,Very professional
5081,I've stayed here twice and both times my credit card had a lot of fraudulent charges. Do not stay here.
5082,The company and plans are great!  Buy the phone and order your case and accessories on amazon. Cell Helmet insured screen protector is a joke
5083,Great staff! Very nice and respectful as well as helpful. That's all you need for a good morning in my opinion.
5084,Very clean and friendly and nice workers
5085,Enjoyed my visit
5086,"Strong margaritas! Delicious food! Spinach and mushroom enchiladas, yummm"
5087,"I called asking simply for professional services to facilitate paying an inmate's bail. I had the means of paying cash or card. My issue was with getting the funds to the appropriate venue; was that the courthouse or the front desk of anchorage correctional complex or online bail posting even though cash only is detailed in the orders?

When I called fred's bail bonding, I was told that thet didn't like to do two hundred and fifty dollar bonds. They told me just to walk into the jail and pay it."
5088,They told me it'd be 30 minutes and then they ended up putting a car that got their 30 minutes after me ahead of me I ended up waiting an hour and got sick of it so I left I'll never go back to that place ever again completely wasted my time
5089,Always supers.
5090,Hadn't been here in a very long time.  Food was great for the price. Service was on point....maybe a little too fast.  If you haven't been in awhile maybe go try it.  We left happy.
5091,Always good food.
5092,Awesome selection and service.
5093,Place for sports fishing and or yeah any outdoors stuff
5094,Slow service
5095,Yummy steaks and food! Always good customer service
5096,Always great!
5097,Friendly Respectful gives u hope wen ur down n out
5098,Very friendly staff with some of my favorite Japanese food.
5099,Nice service.  There's no menu or selection to look at other than what they have placed in the heated containers. This made it difficult to figure out what I wanted because I didn't know what they had.  Place was clean.
5100,Nice short trip to the top of Mt. Alyeska.
5101,GREAT service!  Take time for the tour (adults) and have lunch.
5102,It is your typical Wendy's. They have 4 for 6 instead 4 for 4.
5103,Delicious food!!! Don't miss the shrimp appetizer. The crab mac and cheese is scrumptious.
5104,This mall has my favorite shops. The wifi is virtually useless and there is only one bathroom very inconvenient!
5105,Outstanding
5106,JENNIFER (OWNER) IS THE BEST ! SHES UNDERSTANDING AND CARING . SHE HAS A GOOD HEART . AND YOU CAN STAY THEIR MONTHLY .YOU GET FREE WIFI .CABLE TV . FOR 815 A MONTH AND THAT INCLUDES UTILITIES! YOU CANT FIND A BETTER DEAL LIKE THAT NO WHERE IN ANCHORAGE ! I RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO STAY HERE .THEY HAVE FRIENDLY STAFF .A BAR . THE ONLY ISSUES I HAVE IS WITH THIS SITE ! THEY DESERVE ALOT MORE THAN 5 STARS !
5107,"Got a 2 way remote starter and very happy with it.  My family has gotten 6 or 7 from them and haven't had any problems.  Very friendly, helpful staff and everything was explained well on using it when I picked up my vehicle."
5108,Clean.. good parking.. great view
5109,"Fantastic shop! I've rented bikes several times here and the customer service is consistently been A+.  The gentleman that runs the shop remembers me by name even though I've only been 4 times now.  They're quick to help me get out riding and very helpful, always asking what questions I have and if I need anything for my trip."
5110,I've had enough of fast food
5111,Terrible Customer Service. Would give no stars if I could
5112,Cheap food but open later than most places around herem
5113,What an awesome store. They always have what I need.
5114,We walked in and none of the employees were wearing a mask and after standing there in shock for a few moments I realized that ii was a super spreaders of an already rampant illness.
5115,"Beautiful venue! I saw Harry Potter Live with the Anchorage Symphony and it was magical. Decent ticket prices for events from what I've seen. Seats are decent and somewhat comfortable. Many parking areas around this location, just make sure you arrive at least 40 minutes before your event because parking fills up fast. This place gets HOT, so make sure you wear layers so you can adjust throughout your experience."
5116,Very good food service!
5117,Low paying wages
5118,They do great work
5119,Grocery that has some hard to find elsewhere items.
5120,"Lots of research done to find good hotel close to transport links, at reasonable cost and accommodating party of 4 arriving on different days. Turned out to be the right choice. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast very large choice. Happy hour an unexpected bonus. Would recommend and stay"
5121,Always come here after the gym and they know how i love my chicken
5122,Always have amazing food (enchiladas are my favorite) and drinks. Also tasty nachos
5123,"terrifying ""park"" resembles a crime scene, complete with squatters guarding the restrooms. just back away and let them have the whole park. move along people. gulp!"
5124,"It is small, really small, not much there anymore. Used to be okay but it has really gone down hill. There are a few good places there still like Game On, La Salsa, Joanna's and Heartside Books but they are barely hanging on.

Most of the building is a Sportsman warehouse now as well, which is crazy expensive."
5125,Delicious dinner and DELICIOUS strawberry rhubarb pie! Very friendly staff and owner too!
5126,"There is very little to do in Whittier and their population is only a couple hundred people who all live in the same building complex. I would definitely recommend the boat cruise to the glaciers. It is a little pricey at $200 USD but worth every penny. I saw otters, seals, deer, birds, fin whales, and of course glaciers. You are fed and they even have a bar on board. The trip lasts for hours and they even bring aboard some pollution free old glacier ice to try. The best thing going if your cruise ship is going to be in port for 12 hours as they pick up new passengers and you are on a back to back cruise."
5127,Just a hill
5128,"Great haircut, but a bit pricey!"
5129,"(Translated by Google) The breakfasts here are made for truckers. Prices are ok, nothing from the other world.

(Original)
Los desayunos de aqui estan hechos para camioneros. Precios estan ok, nada del otro mundo."
5130,Great Service
5131,I originally started coming here to support the cause of military and first responders. Came back because the coffee is top notch. Kept coming back because of the girls. Very polite and always in a good mood to conversate. Not bad to look at either.
5132,Had a great time at the talent competion they held here.
5133,Great experience
5134,Fun to stick around
5135,Good place to get a pedicure
5136,great sushi
5137,Excellent coffee
5138,"If you're looking for a homey hotel experience, this place is the best. The room decor and layouts are quirky, and some of the breakfast food was underwhelming, but that's nothing compared to how incredibly comfortable it is to stay here."
5139,Everything you need at reasonable prices
5140,"During weekends and day-time it's a nice enough trail for very small children or people who are not at all 'outdoorsy', but it really hardly counts as a trail since it is plenty wide and smooth to get strollers down without difficulty. There are few trails shorter than this around Anchorage, but many that aren't much more difficult and offer a much better experience of Alaska's natural beauty. In the evenings it attracts highschoolers to hang out/smoke weed on the side trails running into the ravine."
5141,"Sevice was good, Calamari was awesomely unique and delicious"
5142,"Probably the best Texas Roadhouse I've been to.  All 5 steaks we ordered were cooked perfectly, even though they were all different."
5143,ok
5144,They do a great job here....my go-to car wash in the valley!!!
5145,The staff are so helpful here! If they don't carry what you need they're helping you figure out where you can get it. Can't recommend them enough!
5146,The staff was totally cool and did a good job given the place is falling apart
5147,"Never stands to its Seattle counterpart, and for such a large department store, they never have a good pan selection, let alone for tall women ."
5148,Lots of choices
5149,I have been visiting this establishment on and off for more than 20 years.  I have yet to be disappointed in regards to customer service or the quality of my washing.
5150,Amazing food with a twist.
5151,I love taking my shephered  Oakley here! He gets out all his energy during day care and they always do a good job on his bath.
5152,Food is consistent however service has fluctuated but on my last visit service was great
5153,IT'S COSTCO
5154,"Just walked out.  Horrible service and not sanitary at all.  Reuse glasses, do not wash. 1st brewery I have had to walk out of in Alaska.  Ugh!  #disappointed"
5155,"Salesman, Brian, was very friendly and informative. Great place to test drive and buy a vehicle."
5156,We were absolutely delighted with our food selection and plan on returning . Felt healthy and not overfilled. Brussels sprouts side and swiss cheese burger.mmmm
5157,Super big portions and very good food.  Huge menu anyone can find something they like.
5158,They had everything I wanted and then some.
5159,"Every time i have an issue that needs some extra attention, Chris and his crew have gine the extra mile to accomodate me. Thanks.."
5160,Always good customer service and good food
5161,"Nicest theater I have been in Alaska, seats super comfortable, screen were concave so good veiws from any angle. Very impressed"
5162,All employees are great. They have good selection of hair dye colors. Their business hours are awesome and they are in a good location.
5163,Delivery was great and pizza üçï  was yummy
5164,"The bagel sandwiches are outrageous! Great great food, prepared with lots of flavor and giant portions. I haven't tried the pizza yet but each one that was brought past made me want to join the table where it was headed. I'm looking forward to returning."
5165,The only gas station in town. A bit pricey but the service is usually fast and the gas attedants are friendly.
5166,I went for the food bank music festival.  It was great.
5167,Always has shirts and shoes I like
5168,Great rafting and guides
5169,"Sign on the door says they are closed for remodeling, but the building has been locked up for months with no sign of activity whatsoever day or night. I've never seen a restaurant magically remodel itself without people working on it. They appear to be closed for good or at least for reasons other than a remodel."
5170,It's okay. I wouldn't call it fine dining but the price suggests the owners and patrons think it so.
5171,"Fast service, friendly staff and decent food add up to a good fast food dining experience. Their flavorings and quality has degraged over the years, so one of my stars is due to nostalgia and memories of what they used to taste like."
5172,Great
5173,Very convenient for Esterites.
5174,Great place to learn the history and culture of Alaska.
5175,Found shiny kid beads and had a decent selection.
5176,I've gotten relief within days of visiting the Back and Neck Center. The staff is friendly and understanding for those not used to chiropractic care. I'm migraine free 7 days!
5177,Delicious food. The mushroom burger was amazing.
5178,Has wild chairs
5179,"Classic scenic spot along this Scenic Byway, perhaps one of the very best! It's aptly named as at the appropriate times Beluga whales can be spotted from here. There are many other wildlife around the Seward highway to be admired. Its quite windy here so would reccomend having some warmer clothes available. Even though it's a popular place, usually it's not too busy. Caution at this turnout always wise. Do enjoy!! This is the best! =)"
5180,Was in the neighborhood for an appointment and stopped in for lunch. Interior is quite clean and comfortable. Vibe is welcoming and one I would return for. Interested to see how this place is at night. They have a clean and well kept dart area which I appreciate. Brian was the bartender who recommended an excellent house dressing and gave polite service. I live on the opposite side of town but I will probably venture this way again.
5181,Most beautiful spot in Anchorage!!
5182,"Love their service department. Used to go to Lithia Dodge on Parks hwy, but their service department has steadily gone down hill."
5183,Cheap place
5184,Great food and watch eagles fly by . Great views of the bay.
5185,"Visited mid July
Good service and decent food
Burgers were the special that day and my husband enjoyed it
Pretty basic food - lots of vegetarian options"
5186,The cheap cost of seeing movies here gives this a 3-star rating otherwise it would be 1. The theater itself is sticky and dirty and my phone once fell out of my jacket and was stolen here. Used to be in Anchorage people would find a phone and turn it in at the office. It's definitely changing on the east side.
5187,The pastor is a very nice man.
5188,They have a great selection of pets and the staff really are helpful and knowledgeable.
5189,250$ for nonresident. Expensive? There is more options around here.
5190,"Big open space right in the middle of town. Big playground, skating in the winter.. downsides are goose poop everywhere in the spring, and smokers/lurkers hanging around the mini amphitheater when the weather's nice. But a great park to stroll around."
5191,"Extremely impressed with the cleanliness of the place. On first impression you would think it's going to be filthy and smell bad.
The washer and dryer are cleaner than most. There's a public bathroom that doesn't get shut down. But after a certain hour you  need to go around to holiday to use it. Usually quarters are available through the coin machine.

But no. Just the crowds of people are filthy. Homeless/addicts/dealers/and the likes are swarming the parking lot. They don't care about the litter and grab they leave lying around.

But it's not rowdy. But it's not the place to leave vehicles unlocked.  Double check. Lock it up. Put valuable items away."
5192,Always helpful and friendly
5193,"It was okay.   Nothing special, but nothing wrong with it either."
5194,Not clean
5195,Knowledgeable and have great selection of gear and juice.
5196,"Clean, quiet. Well maintained. Camp ground host was friendly and helpful"
5197,My favorite place to camp always beautiful
5198,Bed bath and beyond!
5199,Very nice
5200,Good diner food!
5201,"Excellent service, inventory, haven't tried the repairs but this shop is well worth the visit."
5202,"Great location close to the airport, clean and big , the restaurant have good food and the price is a little bit expensive but compare with other hotels in the area this is cool.
The lobby atmosphere is like a musseum with a lot of things to see. Price is lower during winter. ;-)."
5203,Typical McDonald's with good service.  Love the Denali Mac.
5204,Nice place to sit or walk around.
5205,They have some amazing ice cream!
5206,"Fast friendly service, and great ice cream for a decent price!"
5207,$9 for half a hot dog with no fries... Tasted alright I guess? Super disappointed. (12oz for perspective)
5208,Good service and food
5209,Excellent service and great food. Family friendly!
5210,Great place for parts and things.....
5211,Great gym with tons of equipment. Open to members 24/7
5212,Best Chinese food I've ever had!!
5213,"Good fine dining downtown, the taste isn't consistent so sometimes its better than other times. Nice bar."
5214,Always satisfied with service.
5215,decent budget haircuts.    imperfect but decent
5216,"Will not ever use, asked for a rough estimate on a torque converter would not even give me any information without having the vehicle in their hands. I‚Äôm not paying for a tow unless I know roughly how much it‚Äôs gonna cost me. What kind of fool do they think I am"
5217,Love it.
5218,Great service. Only place in Anchorage with elote' and tacos Al pastor. Food had great taste too
5219,"After their recent move (right next door to the old location) and a name change (That Wings Place), the new restaurant space is amazing. Bright and spacious, with 11 TVs, all new tables and a salad bar, That Wings Place is now perfect for gatherings or parties. Still the best wings in town, and subs to order."
5220,"Always fun for the kids. You know the prices are fair, when there's a long line :)"
5221,They screw up the order every single time at the drive through. Go inside and it's fine.
5222,Great place
5223,"Good prices and a wide range of products. Clothes, electronics, camping goods and of course all kinds of food."
5224,"This place has the best bbq chicken pizza I have ever had. It is expensive though. Still, it is worth it."
5225,Every terminal assistant that I dealt with was very helpful and polite.
5226,This was my second time here. Mia served us both times. She's so sweet and attentive. Food is great and came out fast. By far our favorite place to eat at in Anchorage.
5227,Nice park. Lots of trails. Well maintained. Sprawling.
5228,Great selection
5229,Convenient. Nice employees. Good coffee
5230,"When you are here, you are family. Such a fun, social place for brekky."
5231,"Terrible customer service!!!!!! Always giving people the run around

They also hung up on me as well!!!!

I am very surprised they are still in business

I"
5232,OMG!
5233,"There is a clerk here named Steve and he is the biggest jackass. He made inappropriate comments, thinking he was funny, and then would stare at me to see my reaction. He wasted my time. It was extremely bizarre

I asked for th supervisor's name and then left because I was so upset.  I tried calling; no answer. I tried emailing; no answer.

I wish negative stars was a possibilty"
5234,Love uncle Joe's
5235,"The bar to go, not slow but not to fast paced, a good place for everyone."
5236,Can't beat the five buck lunch unless it's the 6 buck lunch.
5237,"This store is pretty much like Walmart. It has everything in it, even furniture and electronics. This store does a good job of having checkout lines open"
5238,What's not to like?  Great service and food.
5239,Cute little cafe with great food!
5240,"Gross food, horribly outdated decor. I had Stromboli that was disgusting. The filling was just bland sauce and hamburger meat. It had the taste and texture of something that had been microwaved. My daughter's fries also seemed reheated and buffalo chicken nuggets were soggy. Don't go."
5241,"found myself a nail lady here in AK!!! She keeps you entertained and actually talks to you, and gave me the best cleaning I‚Äôve had in awhile since arriving here in Anchorage (I‚Äôm originally from AZ)... She‚Äôs originally from AZ herself and actually kept the prizes from AZ! Affordable and the cleaning was not painful AT ALL!!! I was hesitant with writing this review because I don‚Äôt want her to be fully booked LOL. Buuut, I gotta share(:"
5242,The Powerhouse has some great sea food. Definitely check it out.
5243,"This review is way past due. Pita Pit has been open just 9 months and already I‚Äôve achieved VIP status on their app!!  I‚Äôm always greeted with a hearty hello before the door closes as I walk in.

Staff is friendly and even has my ‚Äúregular‚Äù order memorized. It‚Äôs good to throw them a curve every now and then. But they always handle it well.

Great value for the price. It didn‚Äôt take me long to figure out that double meat isn‚Äôt required to fill me up. They always give you plenty!!"
5244,Excellent place for the kids
5245,Easy to see how locals and tourists can wine and dine.....at any tastes any time...at the end of the road!
5246,This place has everything you need! Great sandwiches too!
5247,Great place to visit if your on an adventure.

5250,"I have never had a bad meal/experience at South, from the managers to the food to the staff it is obvious that quality service and delicious food are the cornerstone of this restaurant!"
5251,"Very expensive, but a great selection. I've tried to find normal things like lentils or barley at other stores, and no luck. Thankful to have options here!"
5252,Great Thrift store!
5253,"Huge selection of fun, interesting, and fairly priced knicknacks and home decor souvenirs. They also have icecream and plenty of things to take pictures of/with."
5254,Get their Safeway app! It will save you some when you shop.
5255,It was fast
5256,Had a great time!
5257,Carnitas are the way to go.
5258,"Solid experience, considering that we are up in the mountains and 2+ hours from Anchorage.

Glad they have hot water and wifi in the lounge. Great views of the mountains too and nice shuttle between the  buildings.

Wish they were more upfront about the included benefits though - there is a spa.

Also, wish that there were better food options and that the rooms had wifi too."
5259,Awesome!
5260,Great pizza and beer place. Can get really busy.
5261,Best pizza in the valley
5262,Very good food and they treated me like family. Also they love my aunt and uncle
5263,Great service
5264,fun friendly antique shop
5265,"Very nice store for all your outdoor gear and activity gear in Anchorage. Kind of a one shop stop for all your fun outdoor supplies. The items change with the seasons a bit. Ski gear is up front and center when I stopped by and decided to write this review, and boy do they have some nice stuff. I get stuck in their camping gear sections every time I wander into this place. Don't be shocked by the prices, they cary nice stuff, and you generally get what you pay for."
5266,Always happy with my cuts‚ô°
5267,"Delicious breakfast burritos, fantastic coffee (mind you,  I also had the worst coffee of my life here ; new barista day I guess).  Overpriced food for what it is, but quiet, cozy atmosphere."
5268,"Very good food, and fulfilling, and reasonable prices"
5269,I am from the south and used to Hardee's. My friend said coffee was old but my food was alright. Not as great as I expected.
5270,Friendly staff. Especially the guy with combed back hair! I don't mind spending the extra couple dollars for convenience.
5271,"This is not a second rate, day old, bakery. They sell fresh bread and goods at almost half the cost you find in the stores locally but you can get a better price if you want the older baked goods. I don't because we don't eat it fast enough."
5272,Absolutely love it

5275,Quality care.
5276,Very fun tour
5277,"Basically help ur self, no one of the employees know where any of there products are"
5278,First time having Little Millers. I ordered a Green Apple cone and it was delicious!
5279,"inexpensive pet friendly hotel, okay location easy to find. Will stay again in the future."
5280,We went to a Concert and it was a nice place to go.  The food looked great.  I just wish they served more than just beer and wine.
5281,"The food is great, especially the elk green chili cheese burger!"
5282,Loved the skinny mini. What a great bagel! Super nice people.
5283,Great place for smoked salmon
5284,"Stopped in for dinner after a long day of fishing. It's a great little place with a lots of history and old photos. Food was decent and at a reasonable price, especially when you consider the fact that you're in Chitina.

I'd recommend the place to anyone stopping through."
5285,Fun to watch planes take off and land but not much else to do here
5286,"Wonderful place, wonderful people... they let my band practice there on Thursdays..."
5287,"Dave (the owner) is a super nice guy, and is very knowledgeable about guitars and other string instruments. I went in to get a new set of strings and ended up staying for almost 45 minutes, just looking around at his records and the instruments he had hanging around the room. I'll definitely be coming back here the next time I need something for my guitar!"
5288,Buy one get one free pizza tuesday. And amazing prices everyday anyway. Love there food!

5297,Nice cozy place chill bar great appetizers.
5298,"Best sushi place, I know in the Anchorage area, I had been to every other sushi place and this so far is the best price wise, taste wise, and customer service.

My favorite is the FBI roll, gyoza, and the deep fried Oreo."
5299,The tuxedo mocha is one of my all time favorites. Tasty drinks and food items every time.
5300,Self wash is WAY too expensive
5301,"Service was great and the pizza was even better. The gluten free crust is the best we've ever had, anywhere. Bonus feature, you can get ice cream from the shop next door and skip the long line."
5302,Did not like the price service not bad
5303,Great place to take the kids

5306,"I stopped in here after going to Second Run to sell some designer items. The woman at the desk who I later found out was the new owner, was super nice and quickly sifted through my items while I was browsing in the store. I noticed everything was sorted very nicely, the clothes were in excellent condition, and that they had some designer or upscale brands like J Brand, Free People, Marmot, Lululemon, Max Studio, Etc. I noticed a few silk tops and was like wait a minute something is different here. I asked the woman who was going through my things if the store happened to be under new ownership. She said actually yes it is and she is the new owner. I told her the changes I noticed and how refreshing it is to see how clean the items are and the nice brands they're taking. I usually stick to the designer consignment places but will definitely be back."
5307,"This place was very dead when we got there, we went for dinner at around 7:00 p.m.So I thought we were going to get our food quickly. We ordered nachos and traditional wings. Took almost an hour to get our food, the wings were soggy and not cooked. I was not going to send the food back I do not do that, I like my wings crispy so I took them home and cook them. They're also lots of flies on the window that they sat us in a booth. I usually like Buffalo wild wings but this location is not going to last if they keep up this sloppy service. They are after all known for wings so you would think they'll know how to cook them. I now see why the place was dead."
5308,Good to look for fishing trips
5309,Great food. Great service from awesome people!!
5310,"I PHOkin love their food!!!! Its a must try, Im on a Pho kick and this is my favorite."
5311,I think all of the cooked food is delicious.  I'm just not a fan of sushi. I love that they provide both options at a great price!
5312,"Outside Seating!

If you're not sure what you're in the mood to eat for dinner then you need to visit the FireTap Alehouse.  You'll find everything from Mac 'N Cheese, salads, pizzas, and steaks.  The booths are very comfortable and there is plenty of room around you if you sit at a table.  No matter where you sit you'll be surrounded by televisions with sports!  Bring your friends and eat at the bar you don't want to wait for a table.  The food tastes great and the beers are cold.  Parking is limited, so come early.

5314,"This place seriously sucks. These reviewers are telling the truth. They never deliver my packages. Ever. I really hope management notices our complaints and fires these people, or at least gives them a lesson on customer service. It's gotten to the point that I purposely avoid having packages shipped to me via USPS. They either leave an orange notice, leave nothing at all, or mark it as undeliverable as addressed, which is the worst of all. In multiple instances of my mail being ""undeliverable,"" the addresses have all turned out to be 100% legible (printed slips..). I believe the courier just doesn't want to walk his lazy ass 30 feet to the door. It's not too hard to believe, either, because when you go to their location to pick up your ""undeliverable"" packages, you realize you are dealing with people that I honestly believe would prefer being dead than working at USPS. Laziest, most apathetic human beings I have every encountered. I truly despise even being in the same proximity as these losers. Can't stand it. Not to mention the inconvenience of having to find time to drive over there during their limited open hours. In summary, find somewhere else. If this is your designated post office for delivery, either make sure your house is as obvious as the empire state building, with security cameras facing the mailbox and a sign reading ""DELIVER OR DIE"", or ... use a different carrier. I'd rather meet the devil for my mail than these people. And I thought I was bad at work. Johnny out."
5315,They are always on point making sure your in and out with what you need.
5316,Went in for a cut and style and Leah was amazing. I can't remember the last time my hair looked this good after a haircut. The way it lays and naturally styles itself is amazing. The prices are beyond affordable. Cannot say enough good things about this salon. I will definitely be back.
5317,Go for the steaks
5318,This store has so many European foods I love & many items you just can't get at regular grocery stores.
5319,Nice ski slopes but kinda awkward bus system
5320,Simply amazing! Coming to Alaska for the first time and experiencing winter with such stunning views is a bliss!

5360,"I give 5 stars for the food, the taste, the ordering ONLINE, and usually for the delivery service.  In store is a completely different story.  Ordering online and picking up in store is only slightly better.  IMO this store should go 100% delivery and online orders because the people making the pizzas are great but the people at the counter suck. They're rude, they mumble, they have zero business dealing with other people.  Seriously.  Order online and let them bring it to you."
5361,Almost time to move to alaska
5362,21.99 gets you a 13.5 inch pizza. With the $3 deliveryfee that's 1.85 per inch!

5374,They always seem more expensive then Fred Meyer's and it's a small store with limited choices. Always dirty. Got rid of self check out and no express lines are ever open. This place keeps getting worse.

5383,Love
5384,Good food Good service!
5385,"Nice store, I knew what I was looking for but wasn't greeted or asked if I needed help. Cashiers was nice, store is pretty easy to navigate."
5386,Tuesday
5387,"Alaskas home improvement stores could do a lot better with selection,  but we take what we can get !"
5388,"Glad they have another Cinnabon near B terminal, don't have to worry about security line"
5389,"For a Guinness fan, this is THE place to go in Fairbanks for a perfect pull.  Met an old friend there and had a great time at the bar. Lot of history in the old building, barely escaping the bridge remodel a few years back. Too bad they went the no smoking route but wouldnt stop me from going."
5390,"Pizza, sandwiches and salads are all tasty and fresh. Service was polite but a little slow considering there were only three tables with people."
5391,Amazing
5392,"I have not been disappointed yet!
Great service and great attitude!"
5393,Pretty good texmex.
5394,Fast service
5395,"It was OKAY. Not bad, but not the best. I guess being from a big city and growing up with a huge aquarium, I was expecting to see more. They didn't really have too much to offer and the food place was closed inside of the aquarium. The ride up was pretty nice to see the scenery. I don't think it's worth the ride from Anchorage. But I've heard that you have to have more planned than just the aquarium when coming out to Seward. Maybe we'll give it another chance before we  change duty stations and plan more when going out there."
5396,NICE
5397,Love their Bernie Mac!!
5398,Best rootbeer and good burgers. Only fast food burger I will eat anymore. The rootbeer is always worth the trip.
5399,It carries everything you need if you live in the area. It's overall a clean store with friendly employees. I like the fact I can get fishing gear here.
5400,A great place for friends and beer!
5401,"Refreshing, healthy, and delicious, but kind of expensice"
5402,Always helpful.
5403,"Disappointed that the lay away plans have be taken away , I use to purchase many firearms here .1"

5405,Great old hotel
5406,Love it
5407,Awesome food great social gathering place for lunch dinner or party events
5408,I really wish they carried more yarn. It's disappointing.

5412,These folks are organized and the food is good.
5413,I love this Church
5414,Went for a freezer saw some out of stock sings on a few. We wasted a good half hour chosing the one we wanted waiting for a employee to be freed up never happened as we were about to ask for help a random employee cleaning product for safety told us there are no freezers available and they never know when the new ones come in but when they do there gone. Just wish it was better displayed all freezers were sold out.
5415,Was a great day for a double scoop of ice cream in a waffle cone
5416,Brutal run course
5417,Owners are fabulous and so is that small town diner food‚ù§

Dr Mussa is confident and incredible at what he does!
I highly recommend them!!
AJ Kolberg"
5420,Excellent! We washed our camping trailer there.
5421,Nice enough small grocery but it gets large prices for its items.
5422,GF loved the gluten free options. I enjoyed the craft beer Alaskan Pineapple Ghost Pepper Gose! A great refreshing beer that has no lingering heat but the subtle hint of all mentioned ingredients. Highly recommend coming here. A must for any local or tourist.
5423,Good if u like sandwiches
5424,Good views of the water. We were fortunate to see several beluga whales at this stop.
5425,Good food. Great to have fastfood that isn't the same ol' burgers or Chicken.

5444,"We have a Doberman pincher and dr sept chopped her  ears  and he was very wonderful, very kind and very informative. He assured me Everything would be fine he did an evaluation on her before he did it. We were a little on the late side of getting it done so he recommended a shorter crop. Which I am glad he did because I‚Äôve seen some Dobermans with a higher crop and it kind of has a little droop to it. But she looks amazing and he also informed me how to post them. Overall great experience. And she looks great everything would be fine he did any valuation on her before he did it. We were a little on the late side so he recommended a shorter crop. Which I am glad he did because I‚Äôve seen some Dobermans with a higher crop and it kind of has a little droop to it. But she looks amazing and he also informed me how to post them. Overall great experience. And she looks great"
5445,"Thiz food bank is filled with volunteers that make you comfortable. Sometimes in other food banks, I'm mistreated,  looked down upon, simply because I'm in need. Im blessed with any donation of food in order to provide for my children."
5446,For those visiting and wanting North Pole to be stamped on your post card or letter here is the place to stop. Busy just like all other post offices in the country but a fun thing to do for those Grand kids etc...
5447,"Fast service, delicious food, and plenty of it! (Plan on yummy leftovers to take home!)"
5448,Clean and comfortable place to stay.
5449,"Way to busy. Had a great waitress,  need a hostess and more busy boys. Hostess could seat people at a table that needs to be cleaned.  Get the busy person on it. Take some pressure off the waitress.  I saw a lot of people walk out because they didn't know they could sit at a table waiting to get clean. Food was good,but not sure I would go back or tell others. It took way to long to get our food. People that came in after us left before us. We are traveling and have long drives. I do not blame the staff. It could be a great place with more organization and staff."
5450,No way will I ever eat here again. Service was not at all professional and my food was not done all the way through. I ask for my money back and was told that because I use my credit card there was no refund. Why they don't know how to put money back ony card I don't know. Oh well.
5451,"Freddy's is the only place for groceries. Carrs  will usually introduce random price increases, or computer errors as they call them, but Freddy's just offers the correct and advertised price. A place you can trust not to rip you off."
5452,So so like the one on palmer-Wasilla store the best
5453,Like the new store
5454,"Most of what you need can be found here, unfortunately the only city around with sales tax"
5455,Fast food....what else can I say
5456,Stupid to order from rude foreigner thick accent dudes. Took over an hour and pizza no good. Who put cheese over pepperoni?  I now love Great Alaska pizza. Drivers never have change.
5457,Great customer service. High quality products that I'm confident will last years. Love the research pants I just got!
5458,Very beautiful no matter what time you drive through this forest!
5459,Bought a 2013 Chevy Malibu from Alaska Sales & Service and had to replace both back wheel bearings within a course of owning it for 7 months I'll never buy a car here again and the service department is horrible the best person in the service department is Niko and Kim the manager is a douchebag
5460,"Good food, especially for a bar!"
5461,Great place for fun
5462,Yummy
5463,"We recently bought a trailer and so last summer was our first time taking it to Seward. This RV park has various options based on your needs. We went far down the beach toward the playground because we have young children and they have electric hookups there. They also have a huge dumpster to throw away trash, which was nice on the last day. The camp host was very friendly. Our kids loved the park (reminds me of Girdwood because it's so personal and fun) and we took daily walks on the beachfront path which leads to the Sealife Center. We took strolls through downtown and there is a library tucked away in there with a fun kid section."
5464,"Food was okay, nothing special"
5465,The huge portions here were awesome! Sandwich and burgers were great...wait staff was a little lousy :/ but good place to eat before the fishermen get there.
5466,Mall at Sears is a quick in and out!  Not the greatest selection but quick service.

(Great salsa selection too!)"
5473,Great food great price
5474,Helpful staff
5475,HORRIBLE SERVICE! Arrived at 8 am and had to wait nearly 30 minutes to order and get our food. 30 minutes is along time to wait when you have three hungry boys with you.
5476,Good burgers
5477,Always great food and amazing staff!
5478,Pretty much has everything you would want from movies to food too close to whatever
5479,Very good foood In the middle of nowhere
5480,Always on my way. I stop by once or twice a week.
5481,Love the chair's!
5482,We loved our experience here. The food and drinks are incredible as well as the service.
5483,"This hotel, as well as the Princess Wilderness Lodge next door, is owned by Holland America Cruise line. We stayed in the Canyon Lodge building, which had a nice lobby area, but the room itself had just the bare minimum. There was no desk and chair as you would find in most other hotels. We requested an extra blanket and a refrigerator and the hotel was accommodating. There is a property shuttle that comes around to take you to the different buildings, since some of them are a little ways from the main lodge. There is a ""dinner shuttle"" that will take you between the McKinley Chalet and the Princess Wilderness Lodge, but will not take you to any of the shops or restaurants across the street (not owned by Holland America). If I had not been on the land/cruise tour, I probably would have stayed at the Princess instead. There really aren't many other hotels to choose from in Denali."
5484,Loved the front desk totally satisfied with how a person should be treated
5485,My go to fleet dealership.  Exceptional communication.
5486,Super Coffee.
5487,"Not very authentic yakitori. They didnt have a lot of the items on the menu. A lot of it flavored with cumin.  Rolls were loose.  When I posted a 2 star rating on another site, I got harassed online. Stay away. I'm Japanese...their food is not."
5488,It was good.. I hadda a beef n chedder..
5489,There are people everywhere with no masks on... Disgusting

5495,Always quick service and good food. Love the deep fried hashbrown option!
5496,Gas
5497,"A friend bought his modular home here and seems to be happy with it. An uncle also bought a trailer here. Our friend has the freedom to let his yard grass grow, has a decent sized place, and can play in the water whenever he wants. It looks pretty, like a high class waterfront place for the most part. Recently they have been clearing out all the run down trailers in an attempt to make the enviroment nicer and safer. And I think it's working nicely. The uncle I mentioned before isn't great, bought a rundown place, and abandoned it. Largely because he couldn't fix it, but also because they told him he either needed to make it look nice, or move it out. Neither option worked for him so they will most likely be scrapping it for him. I would feel bad for him, but the place wasn't a good investment from the start and he wasn't spending his time and money on fixing it if you know what I mean..."
5498,Only shopping mall in Fairbanks.
5499,If you have had a stressful week this is a great spot to go hiking and relax while enjoying the scenery. Cold War Era history site. Old bunkers from when there was one of the 3 NIKE missile sites. Soccer fields for games.  World class level cross country skiing trails can be hikes during the summer months if you feel the need to really work your legs and up your cardiovascular workout.
5500,My kind of place
5501,Good selection of freshwater fish
5502,"With all the different phones, options, features and mods available these days, traversing the cell phone seas takes a knowledgeable skipper. Tessa was just that. She helped us in a number of ways and was incredibly patient and always had a cheery smile. I cannot say enough about her a d the positive attitude. At the time of this writing the AT&T store bathroom was broken so be sure to go first or you may need to visit coldstone..."

5519,Clean..  Roomy..  Great employees!
5520,"I scheduled my truck for service using their online portal.  They called to remind me and sent a reminder email as well.  We dropped the truck off with no issues and received great friendly service.  The truck was done in a little over an hour and they called when it was finished.  They explained their inspection results very clearly and asked if I had any questions.  Would definitely recommend.

Added 11/4/2020
Bought my 3rd new vehicle from Kendall Ford of Wasilla.  A Ford Super Duty F350 Lariat 6.7l Power Stroke.  Once again Donovan our salesman provided top notch service.  Low key, no pressure, just there to help you find what you want.  Great place to do business with."
5521,"Nice room, but pricey"
5522,My dog loves it here
5523,Always a fan of KFC. Stop there before heading home everytime I go to Anchorage.
5524,"This is your Valdez outdoorsman store. Anything outdoors from clothing, to fishing gear and even some bicycle essentials. The price is higher as expected."
5525,This is our FAVORITE CHINESE RESTAURANT! Great family owned property.

5535,One heck of an adventure getting there. Not much there when you get there.
5536,"I'm not exaggerating when I say they have the best fried halibut I've ever had! I think it's a bit expensive for the amount you get, but it's delicious."
5537,Clean and quiet.
5538,"They keep the store very clean. I would have given them a 5, but I was having some difficulty locating a few sections."
5539,"Could not have asked for a better sales representative, loan officer, and overall experience.The guys at Chevrolet of Wasilla went out of their way to get me into a vehicle and a payment plan I was comfortable with."
5540,"The entrance into the Northway mall is closed down! I asked why?  And was told that the thief's where using that entrance, so to stop them from coming in and leaving thru that entrance, they locked that door down! What a insult to people like me, and many other 's! For all costumer to be treated like thief's! And to add to the insult they have a security guard. My question is exactly what does Jo-Ann fabrics is guarding or they feel that fabrics need the same protection as a bank?"
5541,Great AA and NA meetings.
5542,We didn‚Äôt end up buying tires today but the guy who helped us was very friendly and helpful.
5543,Loved my turkey sandwich!
5544,The service was excellent!

5546,Amazing remote location!
5547,Our server summer was awesome. She made sure our food was to our liking and always kept our glasses full.
5548,"I had to put my 18 year old dog down.    Dimond Animal hospital/ midnight sun clinic,  was amazing.   The clinical staff was awesome. I knew they cared about my pain and wanted what was best for my pet.  I wish the front desk people had been as compassionate... they were indifferent.  My experience during this horrific time was so positive, we have chosen to return with future pet needs."
5549,I was pleased that the bar tenders are personable and remembered my preferences. Vodka Mule and Mahi Tacosü§ò

5556,Errrmmurrgguuurrrddddddd food there is off the chain

5559,So much fun!
5560,"Informative, fun and interesting!"
5561,Good haircut at reasonable price!
5562,"Calamari was fresh from a frozen bag, chewed like rubber bands, servedl with mayonnaise for dipping.

Cranberry juice for drinks is really just red water with absolutely ZERO flavor.

Stella Artois served in a bud light glass.  Management could care less.  When we tried speaking to him, we were brushed off.

You will be much better off going some place else."
5563,When I saw the Blueberry Hill French Toast on their menu I had to try it. Was not disappointed. Got a side of scrambled eggs and reindeer sausage. Yummmn
5564,"(Translated by Google) Asian food is full of variety but expensive

(Original)

5565,"They put the stuff in the sandwich in front of you. The restaurant nest door to it looks great too.
Called -Samurai Sams Teriyaki Grill."
5566,This is a must stop for travelers . I'd say it's a hidden Gem !   The Pizza was to die for and the beer selection was awesome.  We will be back the next time we come to town.
5567,"Consistent selection and fruit is normally good however you're gonna pay for it, stuff is expensive but better than driving to Fairbanks."

5585,doesnt look like much from the entrace but this is a fantastic place. delicious salmon. lots of alaskan beers on tap. nice view. can get cold on the terrace.
5586,Great pizza
5587,Well I arrived at 4pm... an hour before it closes and a sign was posted they were out for lunch. Looking inside there were a lot of bare walls and glass cabinets they appeared to be empty. Didn't look to me like this shop would have been able to assist me in finding a high end processor and motherboard combo. But I'm looking thru a closed door. I did not look at their opening hours but if they open at 10 and 4 is their lunchtime maybe hire an additional person or order food for delivery. Lost a $500 to $1000 sale for a 10buck lunch.
5588,Four stars chocolate waterfall was not working when I came in bummed out but still had fun
5589,"Quick service, great staff, family setting. My sons were ravenous and the staff kept filling their chips!! We are scheduling our next business meeting here."
5590,Always great employees. Really treat my service dog and I very well and watch out for frauds. Go early. Store is far less crowded.

5594,Such a rad trail just on the edge of town.üòáüòç
5595,"Never been in one of these stores until today. My wife and I were extremely
impressed. This store is definitely one stop shopping. All the food assortment is unbelievable, not to mention cleaning supplies, a full array of clothing kids, adults, mens, women's, and children's. The people, and see staff were excellent."
5596,went to Kincaid to play disc golf It was an awesome experience solid moose and her baby calf on hold 12 which was really cool awesome ocean view's truly a disc golf course I won't forget thank you Alaska

5601,"The stairs need maintenance, but you can't beat the view"
5602,ANMC has the best place for ALASKAS PEOPLE to be sheltered safe and secure while waiting to recieve the best health care! The staff is the most helpful and willing workers to meet the needs of people!
5603,Best haircut in all of fairbanks
5604,"Wow.  Boat tour is totally worth it.  We saw several Glaciers, of course,  whales and mountain goats (at a distance) and a bear on the beach. Harbour seals, sea lions etc..  Perfect for birders, a stop at marble island has tons of birds!  Clam chowder served was great. Fly over on Alaska seaplanes is so much easier than Alaska Airlines!  Less time since no TSA checks and very small planes...about 10 passengers only."
5605,It's Taco Bell. What else is there to say!?!!
5606,Location is great. Right on the water on Lake Hood. On Spenard which is within walking distance to quite a few eateries. Hotel is nice and clean. The lobby and hallways were at least. I was simply delivering pizza there. Front desk was friendly.
5607,Amazing fun and great staff
5608,this is a great hotel although it would be better if the hotel actually moved like in the name
5609,Always love this place. We rented the whole back out for my bro in laws birthday had a nice dinner. Know the owner well he is good ppl.
5610,Service could improve
5611,LOVE LOVE LOVE this store! Great stuff at super prices AND friendly staff! I follow the Facebook page and got an elliptical for .10! Seriously for 10 cents!
5612,The drive through is difficult to access.  Average Taco Bell food.
5613,My son is 6 years old and was very scared of the dentist. As soon as we walked in they are up front and honest with him and tell him what will happen and are extremely goood with kids with videos to watch while there undergoing procedures or encouraging your child that this is the last part and your almost done. Great people!
5614,Largest variety of craft beers and liquor! I found what I was looking for in a 6 pack.
5615,Best burgers in Anchorage.  They also make mean cheese steaks and poboys.  My favorite burger is the big poppa.
5616,Beautiful place for a Wedding!
5617,"Friendly staff, large portions and consistent food. My favorite is small dallas fillet, salad and loaded baked potato."

5619,"Art, tattoos, toys and more."
5620,"They have pasta, pizza and wine.  It's not the greatest but not the worst.  Pretty nice on the inside.  It's under a yellow awning for a different restaurant that used to be there."
5621,"Staff aggressive towards everybody, even an old lady I saw who was simply standing in the wrong spot at the wrong time. Poor service."
5622,Always excellent food and service.
5623,Not happy at all with restaurant cutting safety measures by not sealing their food for Doordash deliveries!  It should be in a bag stapled or stickered to prevent tampering and the pizzas should be sealed with stickers!  Also I thought due to covid this was mandatory?
5624,That Fred Meyer is to confusing to navigate
5625,When they got our orders right food is good Employees are ok sometimes
5626,As wonderful as every other Nordstrom store we have visited over the years.
5627,Food Order didn't come out right. For how long of the wait you wouldn't be an issue. Customer service was good. Very polite.
5628,Waitress was helpful. The food.. I ordered a salad and soup - (clam chowder). Just potatoes not any clams in it.
5629,Awesome Mexican food at a great price.
5630,"Love the pizza, but the owner is a jackass!"
5631,Curbside works great. Order was ready in less than 30 mins.
5632,"Fantastic pizza,  we'll worth the drive to pickup.  Do order ahead of time though, they tend to get pretty busy."
5633,"Loved this gentle hike in the lushness near the Mendenhall glacier. Nicely maintained trails, bathrooms and garbage areas. Child, pet & elder friendly spot, though there are bear in the area, so keep that in mind if you go. Wonderful place to commune with nature!"
5634,Came here to looks for boots and was not disappointed. The xtratuffs are very reasonably priced and they had a decent selection to pick from.
5635,"This would be a 5-star hike anywhere in the Lower 48. So why only 3 stars? Because in Alaska I've come to expect more wilderness, more isolation, and fewer crowds and less trail damage."
5636,"My first time here during the mandates by the mayor banning indoor dining. The food was reasonably good.  However we were ordered ground beef in our salad and received shredded which included an upcharge.  We also were not informed that using a credit card would result in a credit card fee. Although not unreasonable at 3% (standard rate charged by credit card companies to the business) this is the only place we had encountered the charge and there were no signs or information regarding this charge provided before or during our meal.  We only knew about it at the end of our meal when we saw it listed on the receipt.  While we want to help out local businesses trying to stay alive through all this, correct orders and full cost disclosures are important as well."
5637,Clean and nice people
5638,"This is the worse Taco Bell in town. It certainly isn't bad, but I usually either have something wrong with my order or the employees are rude. It isn't quite worth driving across town to the other most times, but if you have a choice don't go here."
5639,"I still love this dominoes! I order from them at least once a week.The employees are always super efficient and respectful, the store is very clean, and the pizza is always amazing!"
5640,Good food great service
5641,Wow. Do not miss this place. Fantastic food. Beautiful location. Great service.
5642,"I can't explain enough how bad the service is. I have many stories and multiple experiences where the service was so bad that the food could have been great and i still wouldn't have gone back. The food isn't great either, just ok.  And the beer is expensive. I'll stop there"
5643,"Absolutely fantastic experience. Loved the puzzles and riddles, but most of all the staff was incredibly friendly and make the experience that much better. I've done other escape rooms and this experience was by far my favorite!"

5655,Sister went to get batteries changed in car remote. They broke remote and said that dealer can only fix it. A Google search showed they used wrong battery and since they took so long the remote was disabled by anti-theft system.

5656,"Beer was good and cold; tried 3 different beers, Belgian was my fave; I‚Äôm going back today for the pizza; good crust and sauce is made by someone who cares.."
5657,"Easy take out, seems to be real popular by locals and tourists. Lots of live music. Pizza was pretty solid."
5658,"The staff are amazing, they treat you like a valued customer to where you feel like you belong. The food is great with good options and family friendly. Only 1 issue, the higher corporation management took away the huge song selection and line dancing. Now it's a constant stream of the same 10 songs that are all line dancing songs, but yet they're not allowed to line dance. But hey, no one ever accused high management of being smart."

5664,"One of my all-time favorite joints on the Kenai. Great BBQ, good selection of local beers, cheerful & helpful staff."
5665,"Was told that with two insurances I would be completely covered. After two months received a $40 bill for just one visit. Luckily, I did not go in for all 12 visits like I was supposed to within the first month. I would have walked away with a $480 bill for the first month alone. Which does not seem so bad if I was not told I was completely covered"
5666,"Delicious, I recomend this place. Everything I have eaten from here has never let me down. Come hungry, leave happy."
5667,this place is awesome!! prices same as or less than chain stores. Alaskan local since 1971. A must go and see. everything from bees to seeds! even my ferret food brand.
5668,"Food was good, and good sized portions. Unlimited delicious dinner rolls on top of the peanuts. Good service, and good mixed drinks. Comfortable Family atmosphere."
5669,Good enough
5670,Guy was very friendly
5671,Id say it's probably a hit or miss here. I came in it was my first time and I was early because of their if your five minutes late you'll be treated as a walk in policy. Then they accidentally took the wrong person back and I waited about 15 min just sitting there till they realized. And once seated it took literally no exaggeration five minutes for her to wax and fill in my eyebrows... She wasn't who I originally booked my appointment with and the store got busy so she was rushed and I felt she could honestly care less. She also was complaining about how there was no receptionist which is understandable. The person who took my original appointment was still sitting in the chair getting hers done even after I was done and paid and walking out of the store. That was probably the easiest 20 dollars ever made. It would of been nice for this to work out since it's literally only five minutes from my house but I won't be going back again.
5672,The food was great
5673,Great place to walk in the winter time!
5674,Love the atmosphere!  Employees are super nice and our food was delicious.  I had the meatloaf sandwich which tasted great the only suggestion I'd have is to have it on a thicker bread.
5675,"very good pizza, love their pepperoni. although my son likes pepperoni as well but they put cheese on top of the pepperoni, would be nice if they put it on top instead of inside the cheese, but still very very good"
5676,Absolutely AMAZING service & food!! 100% would recommend!
5677,"I used to have a pretty high opinion of the Moose Lodge Fraternity. Yesterday, all of that changed. Particularly the Lodge in Anchorage.

The local news here in Anchorage posted free meal offerings for Veterans Day. The Moose Lodge offered a free breakfast for Veterans. I called them the night before, and they confirmed that.

After slogging through snow and slush, I arrived at the Lodge, only to be told, in a rather nasty manner, it was for the Members only. Basically, I was treated like a second class citizen, and my Honorable service as an EOD Sergeant meant nothing."
5678,Always stop here for top notch espresso's and a baked booster snack
5679,Great food and excellent service.   Prices are also very fair. Love eating here.
5680,"Always very clean, and the best laundry service in South Anchorage!"

5682,Awesome
5683,"This place is in desperate need of an update. Food is average, or less. Service doesn't impress either. The management needs to wake up before everyone gets a pink slip."
5684,"The only place I go for my oil changes, they need to keep water stocked."
5685,My family absolutely  loves this place  the whole staff is awesome and very efficient.    They are not on our network but truly make up for that with impeccable service..
5686,Very good food and good price. Highly recommend
5687,Great food beautiful atmosphere simply loved it and they are still giving us great Italian food in person even now in covid times. Eat garlic!
5688,Didn't find what I was looking for
5689,"Usually okay, but didn't have the new Samsung 20 5G Ultra screen protector or the regular Samsung 20 5G either!  Had to go to a  different kiosk."
5690,Great place to watch gymnastics.
5691,State of the art facility that is your door to Denali National Park. Accommodating staff will go the extra mile to ensure once in a lifetime experience.
5692,"If you live in the Mat-Su valley, it can sometimes be a pain to go all the way into Anchorage for Costco or Sam's Club. Three Bears helps take away the need to do that!

The stores are always clean and well lit. The folks are always friendly even on a bad day."

5707,"Alyeska Resort is a great place for all ages from all over the world. Here, you won't find a crowded ski slope or mega Colorado like resort, bette yet you still find that Local Alaska crowd that still lives and breathes their local ski resort. I've really enjoyed over the years coming to Alyeska, if that's with family, friends or coworkers there is something for everyone. The pool at the hotel is just a site to see, the tram ride up to the 7 glaciers restaurant is an experience everyone needs to see for themselves. As a photography, it's not difficult to create a great photo with Alyeska as your background. If you're thinking of a trip to Alyeska no matter where you live, I highly recommend it! You may even get a chance to see the northern lights! The only thing Alyeska needs is a chairlift to the top!"
5708,"Hot fries , can't ask for more lol üòÇ"
5709,"This place is like a 4.5 stars...

First brewery for me in Alaska, ordered The Smackdown and the waiter tried to tell me it's big and that it was featured on a foodie show and I said ""sure why not"". I just thought he was hinting it may be a lot of food for be but he obviously has not seen me throw down food.

When he put the meat platter down, it is huge! I was hooked on the first bite and I figured afterwards it's the garlic bread! The garlic bread really made it with 5 stars but since the meat variety wasn't all marinated/flavorful...I took half a star off.

I'm not a beer person but there's definitely variety. If I hadn't ordered a flight, I probably would've finished the whole sandwich, but I didn't hate myself after eating half and finished my beer flight, so that's good."
5710,"I first contacted this business because of their a la carte seat shampoo service. My 45lb dog had an explosive accident, a week before the appointment date, over my seats and I didn't care for my floor mats or my exterior being clean. At least until late spring anyway.
The week old stains were spread everywhere on my back seat and a little on the front seat. Some of it even got smeared onto the door handle. I arrived fully accepting the fact that I might be charged more. The website does say they start seat shampooing at $35 but I was quoted $70. This was understandable, my car seats needed a lot of work. It was still better then the $100+ the other businesses were charging for interior packages that included services I didn't want.
About 2 hours later, I was informed that my car was done and ready. I went to the front desk to pay and was charged another $5 for the extra grunt work needed to get the week old stains out. I paid the $75 and went out to look at my car. IT WAS LIKE NEW! I was amazed at how new my car looked! They even had wiped down my dash and my cup holders. My floor mats were vacuumed and the stains on my seat belts were even scrubbed down.
This is my first experience with an auto detail business and I am glad to say that the customer service and the friendly family oriented demeanor that I picked up on, during my 2 hour stay inside the office, has definitely set the bar for me. I will definitely be taking my car back should my dog decide to give me another present or for any other matter."
5711,The equipment is up to date. The outdoor and indoor tracks are excellent. Sometimes smells like old sweat clothes but is not the gym's fault.

Tent City theme, food they tried to make fancy, but pop music. Not a fan. Again excellent service though. Our waitress was great!"

5774,"As a first time RV owner who got a bad deal outside on a used RV, I was so thankful for all the work and assistance Great Alaska Holidays provided. Excellent and helpful staff, especially Riley, who went above and beyond to make sure we had a functioning RV. The staff took care of everything and got it done so quick we were able to use it for this summer. I will continue to use them for all my RV needs just because they are so attentive and make  us feel like our concern is their priority  Cant say enough about how grateful I am for the excellent staff and service."

5796,I love Cabelas. The only thing I wish they would add is Salmon Jerky. For some reason they dont have it.
5797,"Best meat market in the Anchorage bowl area. Nice thick prime steaks. Fresh ground beef at half the price of supermarket junk. Eat better, shop at Mike's"
5798,I was completely disgusted at their inability to do something as simple as maintain a driveway for customers to park without getting stuck in a massive rut of snow and ice luckily I could push my car out otherwise I would've had to make sure they paid for the tow truck to pull is out or face a law suit. Definitely will not receive my business or that if anyone I know.
5799,Ok

I will come back 100%."

5835,"Hours of operation make this a mostly weekend only stop, which collides visitors with lots of other shooters.

Very limited range rules don't allow any kind of defensive tactics work.

Pistol range has about a 3 yard minimum target distance, and rifle minimum is 25 yds.

Otherwise, decent option out to 100 yards for basic shooting needs."

5837,Always a nice place to drop by for a nice warm meal. From the cold outside.
5838,"I appreciate the wide tea selection and the atmosphere of the lounge. However, although the tea trays for afternoon special tea service are very pretty, in my opinion they are over priced. I purchased one tray to serve two persons. The tray was $58! This includes two tasty mini cupcakes, two mini cream puffs, two macaroons, two small scones and the equivalent of two total sandwiches, cut in triangles. All these very lovely visually. I could have purchased individual, full sandwiches and pastries and paid less. Their policy is no sharing any of this with anyone at the table or you'll be charged another $29! In total the $90 I spent, including a sandwich and tea for me, would have covered a much nicer lunch at many other restaurants. If you want something different, want to pay for pretty, and have a small appetite, try it. Also, be prepared to wait. For an unknown reason, it takes a long time to get the food, even with reservations and preorder of the tea tray."

I ALWAYS take my family and friends when visiting, and honestly, they always say it was one of their favorite aspects of the trip. I think they get the feeling they did something truly wild and adventurous in Alaska, just like they see on TV. Plus, everyone always leaves with spectacular photos."

5855,I have to say I'm very disappointed in how little meat there was in my pho combination that I ordered yesterday... When I got home to heat up my food to eat I actually thought it was only soup broth no meat because all of it was in bottom of bowl and there was only 8 tiny pieces of meat and the laab that I ordered wasn't even good barely enough too and to think I even tipped them... I will not be going back to this restaurant ever again they need to make sure there's enough meat per order if they want satisfied customers to keep coming back and giving them a good rating I would've rated no stars if I could this was truly a disappointment save your money and order from another pho restaurant if you want What you paid for...which is plenty and good food!! Not here!! üò°üò°

I nicely mentioned it to the cashier the next time (glasses and huge holes in her ears) I didnt ask for a remake and she just told me it's normal with soy milk. Went again and tried the soy milk again but its disgusting having an iced coffee with chunks at the bottom regardless if it's normal for soy to do that, she even argued with me and told me to get my coffee elsewhere. Very poor customer service and quality if you think it's okay to serve chunky drinks. Gross."

5893,"Great place to eat, the food was off the hook."
5894,"They carry viper autostarts and viper supports the stuff they made more than five years ago and you can usually still get a remote for an old viper alarm or autostart so when your kid loses your last clicker you might not have to have a whole new autostart installed unlike the guys that will still be here when the other guys are""GONE"" they do the best they can but the companys they get their products from are kinda the come and go type but viper is here to stay and street sounds hopefully is too!

Recommended 100%"
5902,Great glacier trip! The stuff are really nice. Allow some time to find another parking lot as the parking lot here is always full before the cruise leaves.

5918,Pretty good
5919,"Excellent. A great experience every time. Modern and clean building feels good, friendly service, and expert help. Plus the video wall in the waiting room is fun to watch :)"
5920,I love this store. I used to live near here and they were my go-to. I like to do the repairs and maintenance myself when I can. When I  moved to another part of town I ended up going to NAPA since they were closer. I was replacing a headlight on a particularly cold day and was having trouble getting the old one off. I asked NAPA if the assist with replacing the part and they said no. So I returned the part and went across town to buy it here. AutoZone offered more selections to me along with the assistance to get the light replaced. I am very happy and will always drive out of the way to support this store.
5921,"First delivery order while staying in Anchorage was philly steak sandwich and a steak dinner,  both were awesome. Steak was tender enough to cut with a plastic knife and seasoned well enough to need no sauce.  Second meal was all meat pizza, and deep fried mushrooms with both meals. The mushrooms and sauce was good enough for a meal itself.  The pizza was very good,  better than most! Way better than the big name pizza franchise joints. Decent prices and respectful staff."
5922,Doesnt tast or look like real German food I been to Germany  so I know potato salad  was vinegary
5923,Great food and service.
5924,Except for the chairs super comfortable place
5925,"This particular Costco is a little bigger and newer than the one on Dimond Blvd, so it had a better selection and is generally less busy, but as far as Costco goes, nothing special, just what you would expect."
5926,Great staff great experiences
5927,"IF YOU ARE FEMALE
DO
NOT
GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They will try to take advantage of you just because you are female. They wanted to charge me $700 and NOT TELL ME what I was paying for. They are RUDE and abrupt. Eventually I got someone to tell me what they were charging me for, a big chunk of the bill was for brake pads on all four.. I took it for a second opinion because they were JERKS and that shop told me my brake pads were at 80% and did NOT NEED to be replaced like BIG Os told me!!!!
JERKS RIP OFF RUDE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5928,Great river views and good salmon fillets
5929,It was outstandingly  beautiful.. An amazing trip!
5930,I've been going here over 25 years and it's a classic for families! They have cheap cones for kids and great banana floats for the family to share. I love how they support local teams and groups. Most of their food is fried but tasty simple and cheap.
5931,"Best in Alaska, customer since 1965!"
5932,The service here was better than most places I've visited around the US. People were nice
5933,Still love.this place and it's a good Lil company to work for
5934,Had my 2011 f150 IWE replaced along with oil change. Had my truck back in less than 8 hours on a weekend
5935,Not a lot of people when I was there early morning. Looks like they have security handing out masks or turning people away at the doors.
5936,Happy place...
5937,"The vibe of this place is so colorful and busy, which is fun. We went for lunch to-go, and had about a 30 minute wait for the food. They have a nice bench set-up outside which is nice. We got the Fourth Avenue Special sandwich, fiesta and Mediterranean bowls, and the Impossible cheeseburger. The Impossible burger didn't taste like meat, but it was good. I also loved the Mediterranean bowl. The fiesta bowl was a bit too spicy for me though."
5938,"Very well managed staff,you guys even helped me push my truck backwards because I had no reverse,the day my best friend Junie Hobson had heart attack on the 7th!!!
""THANK YOU"",""ESPECIALLY MANAGEMENT"""
5939,"The food is delicious! Lots of options. Great place for vegan, gluten free or meat eaters;)"
5940,"Very friendly and helpful staff. The common area is large and has lots of seating. There is 3 spots to eat, all of them prices are ok, food is good portions are small. The views are what your here for. Amazing!!!!. There are trails to walk and a tree house. The rooms are a good size and a full size bathroom and shower. Also offered are fire pits and 2 hot tubs. Priced to stay at the lodge are pricey but worth it"
5941,"Answered the phone and quick response to a residential lockout.  Lock was damaged and could not be picked, but je knew just the right way to break it so the fix was cheap.  Reasonable cost with no upselling.  Wpuld use them again."
5942,I had a great experience. The man I spoke with was very knowledgeable and helpful. The eighth of Three Bears OG I purchased was üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•and their flower prices are some of the lowest in town . I will definitely be a returning customer.

5980,"great food, great service, good location to everyone..."
5981,"They are doing social distancing really well! I felt super safe shopping here, and we got a dog harness for the same price that it was listed on Amazon. It was super nice to be able to let our dog try the harness because she's between sizes."

6002,Their very quick at getting my meals and I dont have to deal with alot of mistakes
6003,They need a before and after pictures
6004,Okay.
6005,"This place is okay.  It's got some mileage on it and it shows in a lot of places.  Most of the machines are quarter munchers with little entertainment for grownups or teenagers.  For little kids?  It's a blast.  My kids love it as long as I have enough money for tokens.  The upstairs seems to have better games but there are still plenty of old ones that will take your token without giving a play.

They also don't serve alcohol here anymore.  Patrons can sometimes be a little sketchy.  Parking lot often doesn't feel safe.  Visits during peak hours should be the best times to visit."
6006,Great knowledgeable staff.
6007,Good coffee and friendly staff.  Very cute building as well.
6008,Thumbs all up!!!! Thanks.
6009,Lots of parts in stock.

6012,"Great food and drinks in a relatively small, intimate atmosphere."
6013,"Never knew what REAL brisket was supposed to taste like until now. All I can say is WOW!

**Update
I see all the reviews that are not 5 star and either they didn't eat at the same place we did or they have no taste buds. And YES you have to pick your sides, duh..... Serving are huge and service is excellent!"
6014,"Great historical saloon with pub food, beer and constant piano. Swinging doors, sawdust floor and good food."
6015,"Very good food, but a tad expensive. My waiter was extremely polite and professional."
6016,"The seating at the restaurant was not very nice. Inside was a bit dark and loud, and outside was hot in the sun, but otherwise we loved it. We had a wonderful dinner! I had the duck breast which was succulent, and my wife had the daily special which was salmon that was fresh with marvelous flavors. Both were just excellent. The service was great. The prices were a bit high, but the quality of the food was worth it. We would go back if we were in the area. Only thing for them is that I would recommend putting in some deck umbrellas."
6017,We were there late...only one server and seemed a bit harried...the appetizer was good..some of the food did not come out hot..
6018,"Its really hard to not like Arbys... word of the wise. Don't ask for Arbys sauce... ask for the to go cup of the sauce they put on the sandwich. Entirely different sauce than what they call Arbys sauce. Polite service, order was complete and my drive thru experience was without any complications. I never give a 5 because no one is perfect. I still had to ask for the real Arby sauce. This franchise won't market and package that sauce. The imposter sauce in the aluminum packets is sour...yuck."
6019,This place has a good variety of Mangas and comics
6020,Good food good staff
6021,Bomb bay
6022,All you can eat buffet. Food is good and never out too long.

6025,Food was great but service was lacking
6026,"Wonderful food, wonderful drinks, wonderful staff!!!! Defently deserves the attention it gets!!!!"

6038,"Just straight up nasty... this place deserves 0 stars. Food is always too salty or too bland. Please, this is not worth your money."

6046,It's the beautiful Kenai Peninsula!
6047,Good popcorn and a good place to see a movie in Kenai!
6048,"Too touristy, but surprisingly good sushi in an area where you'd honestly only expect boring American food.

The smoked scallop (hotate) is an uncommon dish, the regular scallop (hotate) is quality, and the live sweet shrimp (botan ebi) was surprisingly good.

That said, rolls seem to be the focus, and it really does feel pretty touristy, even if it is packed with locals. Don't mistake it for what it isn't."
6049,"They did the prefect job on my truck!  I could not have been more happier!    I've sent three of my friends there so far, and they have been very happy as well!!!! Perfection!!!!!"
6050,Its gotten a little built up since last year which is sad at the water front
6051,"Went through the drivethu, late night. The service is great, quick and fast. The only lack of green sauce is disappointing. Other than that, I'd highly recommend this spot for a late night munchies run."
6052,It's kind of like Chipotle if you miss that from the lower 48.
6053,Good views
6054,Lots of restaurant food for America style edibles. They can get in almost anything if you ask.
6055,Expensive and overrated.
6056,"We have had positive experiences at Providence with pediatricians, and many other doctors and staff. For those individuals, we give 5 stars. We have also had positive experiences with various practices affiliated with the hospital. We are thankful for their good care.

We leave a negative review regarding our experience with OB Triage. At 40 weeks pregnant, I showed up fevering and tachycardic, with complaints of unusual uteran pain two nights in a row. Not once was an OBGYN sent to my bedside. An under-experienced midwife and staff were given far too little supervision, and our family fell through the cracks. Proper protocol was not in place that could have helped protect me and my baby. I was told I had a ""little stuffy nose"" and was sent home to rest. I had presented with significant markers of maternal infection and never should have been discharged-let alone twice. I suffered a traumatic birth, a severe postpartum hemorrhage, and my newborn was diagnosed with meningitis. Hopefully the hospital has made necessary changes so others do not experience similar trauma. We will be delivering our next baby with Regional."
6057,"A standard for outdoor gear, I think my only real complaint might be the gun section. Nearly everytime I look at firearms I've had a weird experience. Most recently I brought in a handgun that I was looking to sell and was escorted back. The person that escorted me didnt tell the staff I was looking to sell and I ended up standing around for quite awhile. When they finally got to me, they didnt believe that I was the owner of the gun I brought in. After an extremely awkward 10 minutes of them trying to find the escort, we started to negotiate. By that time I was so put off I just wanted to leave. I know Alaska is a little fast and loose with firearms but a little more professionalism would be appreciated. Most of them seem knowledgeable in firearms...just not good customer service. Aside from that, the rest of the store actually gets a big thumbs up. üòê"
6058,We love CHSR & love the wonderful hot springs & ice museum! They also have a large dog sled kennel on site & horse rides!
6059,Not sure why its $10 a night but its $8in tax per transaction
6060,Awesome place great staff. Good food.
6061,Need to improve the sales experience.  Would be nice IF they told you what all the gadgets are for AND show how to use.
6062,"Staff always seems a little irritated when I call with questions, we used their curbside pick-up once and the lady complained on where we parked and that it was against company policy to have their employees walk across the parking lot to deliver customer product. She instructed us to park in the very front where it says no parking. Won‚Äôt use them anymore."
6063,"Dave & Buster's has it all! D&B Family friendly Restuarant & Sports themed Bar, Arcade games for all ages. D&B Ticket exchange for toys, gifts & prizes! Great for all ages!"
6064,Generous portions and friendly service.
6065,One of few places open 24 hours in Anchorage for groceries
6066,"The food was great.  Our waiter made us feel glad we went to I hop on Christmas morning.
He help set the tone for the rest of you day."
6067,It's pizza
6068,"Loved the building and staff. Only improvement I would make is to get bigger seats and possibly an escalator in place of the stairs. The sound system was ok. Experienced a few problems during the show, but ultimately we had a great time."
6069,"Huge inventory, the options seem endless"
6070,Beautiful airport facility.  Very bright and welcoming.
6071,Seafood cocktail is delishhh
6072,Excellent food and terrific shakes.
6073,The appointment ability is awesome.  Recommend doing that.

6075,Love this place
6076,"Fast and tasty with friendly service. Their salsas, pickled jalape√±os, and pico on the topping bar are also good."

6083,Very clean and the staff are courteous and friendly.
6084,"Best pet store in town. The staff are super friendly and the store is pretty clean. They price match with anything online, so definitely check their website before you buy anything in store. After adopting our Border Collie (he's a rescue), they helped us with getting the essentials and buying the best products for our pup. They do have a limited stock of items, as compared to what they have listed on their website, so call before you head to the store to buy something specific."
6085,Always delicious food! Thank you Rick!
6086,Staff is very friendly.  They we're able to get my mini van in within a few days after talking to them.  They give you updates on how things are going and when your vehicle will be done approximately.

Sam was great at getting me I fo without being pushy at all!! Even the finance department had amazing customer service. My husband and I agreed that next time we need to buy a vehicle we'll be calling Sam at Kia!!!!
6093,A diamond in Alaska. This place is no joke. Farm and sea to table. The flavors are outstanding and the portions are huge. You must get the Olive Oil Cake for dessert.

6095,It was great
6096,"Wish ida taken some snaps. Best. Fries. EVER‚Äîget the rosemary garlicky ones. WOWEEEE. Iced tea refills a must. Wish we coulda stayed for the 4th of July music and parade festivities. Good vibes. Thanks, taters! üòç"

6102,Great friends and great food!
6103,This was my first visit to Kriners.  The staff was helpful and friendly.   The food portions are hearty and their burgers are tasty.   I would eat there again.
6104,"Good service, fair prices.  The only tire shop into my family uses."
6105,"Haven't been here in a while, glad I came back.

Delivery driver was fast, friendly, animated, and called a couple minutes before arrival. Seemed like he enjoyed his job.

Pizza was on point and exactly what I had envisioned when I placed the order, a rarity in chain delivery pizza experiences.

I will definitely be coming back here."

6119,"I love the selection, smells, uniqueness, and quality of this buffet compared to any other buffet in town. They offer a homemade cheese in their mushrooms that is divine! The soup is great and my son raves about the sushi even though it's not my thing...he says it's so fresh that it's like the master is making it in the back room! So, whether you are from out of town or a regular from Wasilla you should stop by and visit King Asian Buffet!"
6120,loved my two chicken and bacon melts ps excellent service
6121,"It's convenient, but always crowded and dirty."
6122,Things are a bit expensive. Great place for alcohol ans produce.

6126,Wonderful place to pitch a tent!
6127,"My favorite sushi place in town. We live on the other side and go to Ronnie's 1 and Sushi Ya more often, but come to Ronnie's 2 any chance I get. Lots of side dishes and favorites with SMT and avocado that other places don't have."

6133,Nifty eclectic shop
6134,"Simply delicate, healthy and delicious. Enjoyed every bite of my lunch."
6135,"Not any way to silence the constant adds while your fueling.

There's no real way of knowing if your actually getting the fuel additive your paying for or not."
6136,"Very nice fly shop! The kid at the counter knows his stuff when it comes to fly tying. If you need some trout gear, this is the place you need to go!"
6137,"I enjoyed our visit here today. Lots of helpful employees around the store, actively looking to help customers. Many sales within the store. Affordable visit for husband/dad birthday presents."
6138,Good bud prices are ehhhh but they have the best hours
6139,Very delicious blew out my expectations. I had the seafood Mediterranean and that was soo amazing. Everything tastes homemade. Great experience! Will be going again for my bday.
6140,Ok
6141,Kids in a a candy shop. I haven't bought fish in years because I need to set up a quarantine tank. I let down my boundaries because all tanks are separate and not on one big system and bought around $100 worth of tropical fish. Looking at all the tanks I suspected one tank had a tick and being in the candy shop unfortunately I purchase some of those fish forgetting my observation. After a couple hours I'm looking at my new fish at home  & I noticed 5 rainbow tetras had ick. I separated them from my tank with the bags that they came in and proceeded to treat them heavily and a half dose of my own 55 gallon aquarium. I called Alaska Coral and ask them to check the tank where I had purchased the fish and they confirmed that the tank has ich and were totally apologetic& very helpful. It happens but I even told the staff when I arrived every time I purchase fish I seem to get ick. I know people that purchase fish at Shady stores and never get ick. It's just something that I'm fortunately at I guess. The staff was awesome and we're concerned and reminded me on ways to cure the problem. The rainbow tetras spent about six days in their plastic bags and I was concerned about them not eating. I had separated them into four different plastic bags as to have less stress and compatibility. Lowered lights. I have baby guppies which I fed them but not all of the tetris ate. IT all came out for the best and they are swimming in my tank a month or more later. All new fish are very enjoyable. I will buy my face there again because the staff the super knowledgeable and are very good people. They gave me their personal cell phones so that I could call with my concerns. Above and beyond the Call of Duty.   Thanks Guys.  Did he say Duty!!
6142,Fun place to eat quiet environment
6143,Wilderness and lighted groomed ski trails yet right in town. Warm and cozy on a very cold night. Snacks and hot drinks along with restrooms. Quite an oasis.
6144,Good
6145,Crazy parking lot. My car always gets dinged.
6146,Awesome place to go see if you are in tj.ge northern part of Alaska.
6147,Consistently great food and service.
6148,Great options and they change the flavors regularly. Yummy extra toppings!!
6149,"Place is super adorable and and has a very chic look and feel. Good food and strong coffee! I think the overall look is awesome and staff is friendly.  Prices are good. Made for just a small bite, not large portions. Only thing I recommend for improvement is maybe a coffee refill while sitting down and the Wi-Fi is a tad slow. Overall, will be back!"
6150,There's a few stores that are worth checking out.
6151,A little pricey but delicious and good atmosphere.
6152,"Great service, awesome selection"
6153,"As always, great burgers, food and excellent service. I go pretty often compared to other restaurants."
6154,Cashier's very nice and employee helpful finding what I was needing.
6155,"Rooms are nice and larger than expected, surrounding area is beautiful"
6156,"Great place to meet Santa, and to buy Christmas decorations and Alaskan items :)"
6157,What a great place! Great shaved ice treats!
6158,everyone should have to have a mask on
6159,Lots of great products
6160,experience was good. just the movie sucked.
6161,Yummm! Our lunch was as tasty as ever. The mask wearing staff were cheerful and attentive. Thank you for a great dinning experience.
6162,"The food is a little hit or miss but all the beer is delicious. This is probably the only place in Alaska (that I know of) that has ""Real Ale"". If you've ever been to the UK, you know what I'm talking about. Staff is always friendly and I've not had a bad experience here yet."
6163,"Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. After a day of Jeep mudding, they got the JLUR looking new again. Highly recommend."
6164,Best coffee in town!!!
6165,"Sunny, enjoyed watching ducks geese swimming and all the people out enjoying the sunshine and hot day"
6166,They were good when they first opened. Speed of service and quality of food has gone down markedly.
6167,"The best bar in Ketchikan. We had a wonderful time there, and they have the best burgers in town. The perfect little place!"
6168,Comfort food at its finest! Excellent burgers and I love the abundance of choices on toppings and sauces.
6169,The staff here are quick and polite.
6170,"From Eielson to safeway it's a short drive for convenience. There is a Starbucks within and with a rewards card I find many deals. Great customer service and is open until 1am , nice for late shifts."
6171,Yeah it's good
6172,Great food and service.
6173,Their best feature is the hair salon.
6174,"Great food, clean location, fast service. Everything was nice"
6175,The older trendy design is appealing along with old arcade games. The blackberry milkshake is one of my all time favorites. Also they serve elk and bison burgers in a 1/4 lb and 1/2 lb options.
6176,People at CarQuest was kind and courteous and help me get what I needed for my vehicle if you need to get parts and stuff this is the place to get it
6177,Super service all around. Day front desk persons are so friendly and her knowledge of Seward is awesome. Breakfast staff kept things fresh and very pleasant. Super selection of food. I'd highly recommend this hotel.
6178,"Good food,  decent prices and friendly staff.  My wife loved the Pink Panther."
6179,It's not bad
6180,"Janice in the Service Department is simply the best! She always goes above and beyond, listens to concerns, and works hard to make sure we leave more than satisfied. She deserves a raise!"
6181,Its a school bus company...
6182,"Simply wonderful, overpriced pizza. Great staff. Beautiful setting."
6183,Not very good but maybe we caught them at a bad time since they were about two hours from closing.
6184,"Beautiful, clean, comfortable, classy, and accommodating. Every time I've stayed here has been a great experience, even though I don't ski. It's a bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for!"
6185,"Right on Kenai lake, beautifully maintained camp sites. Nice location for local fishing"
6186,Staff are friendly and helpful. Couple downfalls though is that if you're looking for car stuff theres barely any staff there that know much about it. A huge pro though is that they price match to other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.
6187,"They're pretty sweet, though when you bring your dog or cat to day care, you don't really get to see what's happening behind the scenes."
6188,"Although I do like and will continue to use Sherwin Williams products, I will not buy or have my customers purchase anything from this shop in the future. This store has rude and unhelpful employees. Instead of getting all huffy and puffy and getting an attitude when a customer points that out, maybe try to help them with a solution to the problem. It's been more than one occasion of bad service at this store or i wouldve ignored it.
Obviously if I have an account with Sherwin Williams you guys could've charged it to me later had the customer called back and said no to the charge. But instead of solutions, I was met with attitude. Not a good way to do business."
6189,"Great catering, excellent food, friendly and accommodating staff."
6190,"It's a Walmart, it's got everything all the other ones have. Could definitely use more cashier's working. But that's the same for most Walmarts, so it is what it is."
6191,"Delicious crepes in a large variety of flavors.
Cheesecake with strawberries and Priscuitto Blue Fig were wonderful."
6192,Subpar service and food
6193,Good Burger. Great shakes. Locally owned quality place
6194,"Very helpful and knowledgeable staff that are willing to help choose the right product for your pet. There are a wide variety of products for cats, dogs, fish, small animal and reptiles."
6195,Long lines
6196,Good and ok prices
6197,"Chris is the best barber I've seen in years.

The entire establishment has a wonderfully friendly atmosphere, and I look forward to taking my family there for the foreseeable future."
6198,Nice short walk around a lake.  Developed trail.  In the winter people ice skate there.
6199,"The best McDonald's I have ever frequented, the customer service is both friendly and fast!"
6200,Nice Greek menu
6201,Was very satisfied with my experience. Staff were personable and a delight to my experience will definitely go a be ain for date night
6202,"Very helpful and carry a good stock..had a weapon sent to them via mail to transfer to me and unfortunately I got delayed by NICS.  They released the firearm to me after the 72 hour requirement with no ""proceed"".  Was worried about the delay since that was the first time that has happened..plus they waived the transfer fee because I spent $150 in store on a case and some ammo."
6203,"We have used Murphy's Auto Care Center for several years. I have always been very happy with their service and their rates. Not only are they quick, communicative, friendly but their estimates have always been close to what they end up charging us. I respect the fact that they ask us if we'd like x,y or z and give us the price instead of just finding something that needs done and charging us."
6204,"As usual, cold food."
6205,Helpful staff and a good selection of used gear. Will definitely be in and out of there many times.
6206,If you want to pay for half of the job to be completed go here. Probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced in the industry. Watching them upsell things like coolant top offs with no explanation for why these people might have low levels. If you complain to corporate office they get ahold of someone that calls days later and gets a piece of the story to never be heard from again. This place seemed shady with their tactics and I would not revisit this location again.
6207,Always friendly staff and fast cashiers. Rare they are out of something i need üòå
6208,The one on 5th St.
6209,Yessssss
6210,Fries are Amazing and the milkshakes are my favorite üòã
6211,"Roadside Dip & steak fries,a must have"
6212,Send a postcard from the North Pole
6213,"Grrrrrrreeeeaattt place do ur workout,and get a nice tan as well"
6214,I work there I hate it
6215,Great food
6216,Awesome customer service. I'm a regular and they really help me out when I need a little extra cash on my pawn. I recomend Alaska fast cash.
6217,"The food was fabulous, as well as the service thank you very much."
6218,Very spicy and very tasty.
6219,"I‚Äôve been to many fjords in Europe, and hands down, the Resurrection Bay is one of the most spectacular ones that I‚Äôve ever seen. Mount Alice is the crown of the fjord and with the clouds building close to the sunset, the scenery becomes truly breathtaking. Bear in mind that it becomes really windy, and even in summer you‚Äôll need a jacket if you wanna stay there for a long period of time."
6220,Thank you
6221,Very interesting place to visit.
6222,Lots of restaurant food for America style edibles. They can get in almost anything if you ask.
6223,I love their spicy sause with the grilled chicken. I also reccomend the grilled egg rolls. 5 minutes or so wait on food. Only downside is that prices are a bit high.
6224,"It can't be a surprise to anyone that has responsibility for this place, that the current parking situation is inadequate. It was 11:30am on a Thursday and the place was packed to overflowing, they had an employee out showing people where to park along the shoulders.

This is a recurring issue at National Parks, they'll have abundant space and  land, much of which could easily be used to expand parking and make everyone's visit more pleasant, but instead we are left idling around the lot looking for a space... like we were in downtown Los Angeles..."
6225,Would be the last place I would go.
6226,Great food love the service a wide range of great dishes and u can range the heat from thi hot 1 to 10 I've had the times 10 it is legitimately one of the hottest dishes in fairbanks area and u can apply that to many of there dishes. I'd give them a 9 out of ten over all. Great job guys
6227,"Good prices, great staff. Very helpful!"
6228,Plain and mildly affordable
6229,Nice hotel
6230,Excellent
6231,My go to happy hour joint!!  Love this place great atmosphere and crowd!
6232,"On my first visit, was so nice! I cant remember her name, she was a cashier who helped explain and gave great service. Love her!"
6233,"The place is nice. It is cold where the go karts are. There lots of game machines. There is an are where you can host parties. I coould not play laser tag, so I would know how it is here."
6234,In the heart of Fairview
6235,"Great burgers and fish burgers. Fast service, too. Cash only"
6236,Fantastic burgers and steaks
6237,Love the onion blossom!!
6238,Great store
6239,Delicious Mexican food served with generous portions.
6240,Majestic nuff said
6241,It's McDonald's. Always something missing from my orders
6242,No complaints. Staff is very friendly and patient w my questions üòä
6243,I will never stay here again.
6244,"Really nice place. Can ski, snowboard, snow shoe and cross country ski. A lot ski trails"
6245,I stopped in to pick up an online order. Customer service was prompt with getting my order and assisting me with loading.
6246,"I like it,people r knowledgeable and nice"
6247,Great place for break from downtown shopping
6248,LOVE their fish and chips!!  Fabulously yummy French fries delicious Halibut!! Always friendly and great service too!  :)
6249,Mount and balanced snow tires on my truck day of despite being extremely busy. Probably the best price I could imagine. Would recommend for service. Many customers were comming and going that seemed to have lasting relationships with this place.
6250,Cool place... Quite literally.
6251,Prices are decent and good selection
6252,"We went for lunch on a weekday and this small place was hopping the entire time. You order at the counter and they bring your meal to your table. I was happy to see they had salads, soups and other light fare, so I tried the summer salad. It came quickly, especially considering how busy they were. My salad was a good size and did not skimp on the goodies. It was delicious. The price was not bad for Anchorage. This is a great addition to Anchorage lunch options."
6253,"Thank you sooo much for remaining open during this ""hunker down"" order. We still need our medicine.üòä
We can adhere to the restrictions.
You'll be my favorite dispensary from now onü•∞"
6254,Very helpful employees.
6255,Loved it
6256,Best pizza hands down in the USA
6257,Best pizza in town.
6258,"The service is good. But, the prices are outrageous."
6259,Nicest airport in the nation!
6260,"Nice service, decent food, portions are crazy big."
6261,Awesome bar
6262,Offering easy way to export your local salmon catch
6263,Good park
6264,"I got a tree there one Christmas and the staff was not helpful or kind. Thought it was a fluke. I bought flowers today, different staff and they were unfriendly and annoyed. I only asked 2 questions, where are the 12in hanging plants and what kind of flower is this. 2 different staff members too. Wild. Not much of a selection either."
6265,Good food and friendly service. Very reasonable prices.
6266,Drink drink drum said the bumbs on the corner üçªü•Çü•Éüç∫üçπüç∏üç∑üçæ
6267,They took care of me and hands right away and follow ups are great i recommend Dr Fortson office
6268,So much to see not enough time.
6269,"Denali has something for everyone. Free shuttles for the first twelve miles of the park (you can also buy tickets to tour buses for areas of the park not available to visitors' vehicles). There are dog sled presentations a few times a day, a well planned system of trails (the Savage Alpine Trail allows a good view of Denali [about 80 miles away] on a clear day, but it is fairly strenuous: 1-3 hours depending on your pace climbing to the summit). Mountain Vista Trail is incredibly easy and can offer a view of Denali. During our time in Alaska, we've noticed the best time to see moose is around 8-10 in the evening (August) and this held true in Denali."
6270,"Good food, can get noisy at times"
6271,I like LOWES better than DEPOT.    Friendly employees. Clean store.  Well stocked
6272,Chinese fast food.  Tasty.  Nice owners.
6273,Costs way to much for portion. Guy convinced us to get kids popcorn chicken. Yes it tasted good but two fast food meals costs 27$. It was a plate of maybe 7 popcorn chicken pieces and handful of fries for 13$ and the pop was another $2 charge for refills. Hubby got burger and burger was ok size but barely any fries. Could have eaten at a proper restaurant for cheaper but it was there and kids were hungry. Food tastes ok but prob won't got back unless prices change. Also it's in the food court of the mall if you need location.
6274,"The best food at very reasonable prices. Generous servings and delicious food. Order the chicken parm, its fantastic!"
6275,Really good food for a really good price
6276,"Not quite what it used to be 15 years ago, but still better than fast food"
6277,"Very pretty area, with historical significance."
6278,The food is excellent the lunch specials are very well priced with a good amount of food.
6279,"This place is hidden inside the building, but is well worth seeking out. Great pad thai."
6280,Great calamari!
6281,Delicious sandwiches and very friendly service!
6282,"The service was great üëç Food was good, only problem was the chicken wings were very small. Cute place we will be going back for round 2. *****round 2 was Valentine‚Äôs Day- went in early with my wife and young daughter. Had a nice meal and few drinks. Our server was the same as 1st time. Order a small To go and the kitchen lost the ticket- 35 min later. Gave refund for to go and said sorry....not the way to handle things ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è"
6283,Good service
6284,It is so worth a visit
6285,It's getting better.
6286,"I highly recommend Bering Sea vet for your animal needs. All of our pets have been seen here. When it was time for one our dogs to pass on, Bering Sea was great. They ensured we had a comfortable and peaceful send off for our dog. Prices are also very reasonable."
6287,"Always beautiful inside. Staff is friendly and greets you with a smile. 10/10, will be back."
6288,Best costumer service you will find at an airport! Always great to know you fly with some of the best .
6289,Good food.
6290,"You want it, they got it"
6291,Love Alaska Buds
6292,Love the variety
6293,"I have been going here off and on for over 15 years, and have seen many changes over the years.  Recently there has been a change in staff and the downward trend that was happening has been turned around and I have seen improvements in the quality and cleanliness of the shop.  Keep it up."
6294,the best! try the home fries!
6295,"Very good food, great service"
6296,Always a great time
6297,"Unique and delicious, a real treasure"
6298,"Fred's West is the best place for clothing sales and a quick-grab lunch or dinner. They have buffets of hot food available. Honestly, their food is better than half of Fairbanks' restaurants. Only downfall is that their parking lot is super tight and there's usually sketchy people out there. Otherwise, we go to this Fred's on occasion. We grocery shop at Fred's East because I find it is better organized (for me). Their donuts here are best of all the grocery stores in town. Go after 6 pm and get them half off."
6299,Good food. Good service. Their thai tea was the best i have had in a long time.I would strongly recommend
6300,Never seems to get the orders correct
6301,Nice gym
6302,The gospel preached true!
6303,Prices are high but it is all the way out in Delta Junction.
6304,The food was absolutely incredible. It's got beautiful fresh produce. There is also a large food library. Beautiful ocean views from nearby.
6305,No fries??
6306,"Had a great time, simply beautiful."
6307,"The deer seem kind of sad, just a pen where they sit together under the only shade. The fudge is overpriced (4.99$ for a slice). And it seems like a gift shop abusing the idea of Christmas all year round."
6308,Customer service not friendly floor associates not too helpful!
6309,Great choice for everybody...
6310,"It was very hot, hardly any trees for shade but playground was nice."
6311,"I tried their Cajun sub and it was really good but their were a few mentions, the sandwich was way to soft and when i tried to pick it up everything fell out the sub also way to much sauce and i felt like I could really only get sauce and bread every time I took a bite. I would like to go back but I think I'll have to try a sub with less sauce more meat on it, oh and the Cajun not spicy at all."
6312,Very good
6313,Was good but not as big or as cheap as I remembered
6314,Its always a learning experience when I take my Yorkies to the VCA FAR COUNTRY VETS.
6315,Has your Alaska work gear needs.
6316,If the prices weren't so high it would be better
6317,Awesome experience
6318,Very nice new owners
6319,"Friendly staff, nice selection and knowledgeable about their products."
6320,Love it
6321,Good service friendly
6322,"Don't charge me for a bag I didn't ask for, and then not take the charge off when I tell you I don't need a bag.  And don't insult my intelligence by trying to withhold the receipt to cover your tracks.  Shady . . .
To top it off, we found the same things elsewhere for less."
6323,"Good food, very fast service.
Takeout only at this time."
6324,My food place
6325,Great place buy cigarettes buy nice pipes
6326,Quesadillas are my fav here!
6327,"Awesome food, great staff"
6328,Favorite place to shop!
6329,Awesome my son loves it
6330,Its fair time.  Food and fun
6331,"It's always classy at Thorne's. Whether you're up for some day drinking, or your an afficianado of rare liqour bottles in backlit display cases, Thorne's is the place for you.  Do you like burgundy leather love seats on wheels?  Check.  A bucket of fried halibut?  Check.  Stumbling outside into the bright sun after sitting in a dark, underlit cave for awhile? Check."
6332,Friendliest staff ever
6333,"Pros:
+ Nice and spacious sites
+ great beach access
+ Great view
+ Eagle viewing

Cons:
+ No water
+ Few stops"
6334,Servers are great.  Please leave a generous tip.
6335,"Gross food and bad hygiene practices. Dont risk it, gas station food is safer."
6336,"I'm a geologist. Really nice folks, very nice selection, price is also impressive for being up here in Alaska. Usually the better priced rock shops are nearby where the specimens are found. I'm about to go hit this place up again for some Christmas presents for the family."
6337,It's the only water park in Alaska. It's fun.
6338,Closing
6339,Great drinks
6340,"i love their apple ales, and the mushroom pizza ! sucks they dont do reservations & that the 45 min wait is everytime you go, regardless of time of day"
6341,Clean restaurant.  Good food.  Service with smile.  Thank you.
6342,Had many employees pass me up without even making eye contact let alone offering me some help.
6343,The only one I go to  every day. It has a lot of american food.  Not so different like red apple has asian and mexican food inside of it
6344,Awesome
6345,Very clean!!!
6346,Pizza here is amazing!
6347,"Great example of the chain. Customer service is top of the line, with friendly faces always willing to lend a hand. Pretty cleanly for the most part, and competitive pricing with the other chain hardware store. You won't find highly specialized tools here (check AIH), but you can get most home improvement jobs started here, at least."
6348,Freindly service really helpful even when they didnt need to be
6349,Great food but could definitely use a bit of a remodel inside.
6350,Good food and good customer service.
6351,"I love this place, the food the drinks and the atmosphere is all great !!!"
6352,"Best meal we had in Seward! I got the salmon, and it was delicious. It‚Äôs right next to the water, which was really fun."
6353,Good food.  Good service.
6354,"For a little drive of 22 miles from my house, Bering Sea Animal Clinic's service is great. Dr. Bob has a strong clientel, that trusts him with their pets."
6355,Best in town if your not a uber or lyft caller.
6356,"I've stayed here a few times during both Summer and Winter. Fantastic resort, with great staff. The resort is surrounded by mountains and beautiful scenery. Within the resort there is a salt water pool, a couple nice restaurants, and a spa. There is also a tram that takes you up to the top of the mountain for ski lovers."
6357,"usually pretty good food, however management needs to take a look at staff because there are too many weak links."
6358,"They are ok, but they got my order wrong!"
6359,Well organized. Fairly ample parking.
6360,Cheap
6361,Too much gunk on their sandwiches and the fries were mushy with WAY Too Much salt
6362,"The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We ate and the restaurant. The menu was different. My only critique would be the kids menu....my kids didn't really eat their msc n cheese because it had  ""weird"" ingredients. Most kids want familiar things. I appreciate them for being creative but, a lot of kids are picky. We will be back!"
6363,"I am removing several of my previous stars due to their ridiculous operating hours since the pandemic. They close at 830 PM in a city that has 24hour daylight and has an entire part of the population on a night time schedule.  Their new hours make it impossible to shop there for myself and many others. They do not seem any cleaner then usual so it's an ongoing frustration that they haven't extended operating hours at all, 830 is just way to early"
6364,I didn't hate it just the service that day wasn't the best took for ever to place our order we have always enjoyed it in the past
6365,"an ever-changing set up and management, But it seems they are slowly improving. worth a visit, if nothing else to let them know you want that kind of service in Fairbanks."
6366,A place of great wonder...
6367,Quaint
6368,"Good store, good prices."
6369,"Still 'fast' food, but tastier than most of the other options. Love the fries and Frosty!!"
6370,Perfectly steamed rice. Side dishes with lunch special are delicious. Food is incredible. No annoying music and atmosphere is very chill. Staff is great! Good lunch special pricing. Side dishes alone make it worth it. Bulgogi is pretty good.
6371,"Tasty food, I enjoyed the chicken bowl."
6372,Have everything but a little spendy
6373,love it!
6374,"Great place, great singletrack system. Watch out for the grumpy local hikers and bikers though...."
6375,Just like most
6376,Very busy today and a bit of a wait. It is happening more often as the app online orders may be taking precedent over walk ins.
6377,Good egg rolls and pho
6378,"Amazing Burgers, and fairly large quantities... Slightly overpriced..."
6379,Drink great! Bar food ok ..bar tender didn't seem very friendly
6380,"Love this store, always stocked nicely and the staff are helful."
6381,"Generally a good place to eat for some snacks or a meal... Menu range is from very cheap to moderate if you're getting a lot. Sometimes the cashiers can take a while to work their way through a line, but this is likely due to understaffing, and not the employees fault directly."
6382,Always has what im looking for
6383,"My all time favorite coffee and bfast sandwich pit stop after a long flight home. Sunrise jalape√±o chedder bagel, sausage, extra egg, and extra cheese bfast bagel. Double toasted. Best 6$ spent everytime‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ"
6384,"There's not much there, but it's got great viewing of the seaplanes landing and taking off."
6385,"My first time visiting this place. When I first walked in, it was a bit overwhelming. A lot of CLOTHES. But it is as organized as they can get it. And the staff was VERY helpful and friendly."
6386,"Great quiche and good coffee. The place was cute, and the staff very friendly and helpful."
6387,"Great prices, especially if you're a Safeway member."

6389,Really very very very good crayfish and fantastic rice on the maki
6390,Delicious food and drinks!
6391,Kids sure love it
6392,"Surprisingly bad. Omlets made with boxed eggs not fresh. Asked for crispy hashbrowns got exact opposite. Toast was not! Butter on toast is not butter! I was surprised when i arrived on a Friday at 640 there was 2 tables full. Now i know why. There used to be no better place for breakfast, no longer trueüò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

Shame, on triple D years ago. Not the same anymore. Freaking margarine bullüí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©"
6393,Knowledgeable and very helpful. Kevin also put together custom juices with my favorite flavors.
6394,Very busy ! Drive thru is usually 5 cars deep. Quick drive thru. Lobby is not quick at all !
6395,"We have lived five blocks from Seong's for years and finally made it there for dinner last week. We should have gone years ago. The menu has a pretty standard selection of meat, chicken and vegetable Asian dishes, with a great selection of sushi and rolls. The food was well prepared and tasty, and the spicy dishes were good and spicy.

The restaurant is cosy, and the night we went, it was full. The service was very good for it being so busy, and we will definitely return."
6396,Expensive but good bakery
6397,deals
6398,Place is lovely during the winter. I suggest a long walk with some good videogame soundtrack and youll be in heaven
6399,"It would be a 1 star but the waiter was actually pretty good. Everything else was terrible. When we got our appetizer we noticed a black chunk of something on the small plates, upon inspection we realized it was a USED chewing Tabacco dip pouch. After we got our food the table next to us just sitting down also found a Tabacco dip pouch in their shareable plates."
6400,Gorgeous views
6401,"Deliciuos, great slices. Worth the cost."
6402,Spectacular view of the Northern Lights!
6403,Great authentic Mexican food and fast.
6404,Great park for the kids.
6405,"It was ok. We went on a weeknight, even made reservations. Super slow service, we didn't get water until we were there almost 30 minutes, and when we ordered drinks and appetizers, it took another 30 minutes to get them. Add another 30 minutes to get our food.

I ordered one pizza to eat there and one to take home, one crust was very cooked, almost burned. The non-burnt one was good, but not excellent.

I finished with a brownie sundae, I was was good."
6406,Cold chewy pizza and horrible customer service !!!!
6407,I always bring visiting friends and family here. Go on the little tour bus if you can.
6408,Great service. Good food. Be aware of the large portions especially on the risotto.
6409,"Always great service and staff, we enjoy returning Everytime!"
6410,Good food
6411,Good place to visit. There is a lot of history and lessons to learn.
6412,"Cozy, small, rooms. Nice places in the hallways to hang with friends. Poor ventilation."
6413,"Dropped off some friends at the hotel. The lobby was very clean and the staff were very polite and courteous. The front doors were a bit small though, only being just wider than the bell cart."
6414,Margaritas are great if it had any tequila. Ordered a pitcher and between 2 people not even a buzz what a waste of 25.50 the cost. Food was over priced and had little flavor. They don't even make the chips in house just store brought. This is just another Fairbanks knock off Mexican restaurant. Will be waiting for a manager or owner to contact me.
6415,This location is very clean and organized. Just ask for the key if you need to use the restroom. Service was reasonably fast and completely accurate.
6416,Best place to find Oriental foods and goods.   One of the only places to find the awesome shower scrubbers
6417,Great place for animal products.
6418,This place is strange for shelter everything echoes and certain staff are very mean and not very good food and people demoralizing you by watching you shower while on there phone no public restroom and people coughing all the time and only Polly John Trump wall . Not enough blankets or clothes.
6419,Good.  Usually get good service.  The chicken is trash though.
6420,Great place
6421,Awesome experience with therapists that really know alot
6422,I love love love thee food and my nail shop is right next door..
6423,"The last three times I've gone there it's put water on my truck and that's about it at best, the last time it stopped halfway through on the first wash and told me to exit. I called the phone number to get my money back or a real wash, impossible to answer or return calls!"
6424,I didnt think we'd find one way out here
6425,Busy this Monday morning. Mask up!
6426,Dave in Parts and the guys in the Quick lane shop are true professionals!  I highly recommend Seekins Ford for service and parts.
6427,Excellent care.  The folks were not only friendly and kind but seemed very good at their jobs
6428,They dont have the 5$ box
6429,Always have the wrong sauce and seems like they're employees just goof around and are rude.
6430,The salsa is to die for. Foods good too
6431,Unnecessarily long waits. The quality of the pizza is not always consistent.
6432,"Red was an Outstanding guide. He showed us all of the sites at the sanctuary. What plants were edible, the different levels of the ecosystem, slugs and more. What was even more outstanding was that the information was delivered in a way that stuck with you. We went on a hike three days later and my mother was in awe of how much more she was seeing from just a walk on the woods. Understanding nursery stumps, looking for hidey holes, and knowing that if we wanted to, we could eat the deer heart plants that we saw on the forest floor."
6433,"This was such a nice place to have an outdoor gathering after our wedding ceremony and reception.  We rented a shelter and had a fire and such a great time.  Unfortunately, you have to vacate the premises by 10PM, but we were able to move the fire to the beach and the festivities continued."
6434,"Very rude people. I had to call back and ask for a taxi that would fit 4 adult and a kid, the man who answered rudely said you know what we can‚Äôt keep sending taxis out to you just call someone else. No one even came out and showed up. So how would it hurt to send someone with a bigger car. Very disrespectful. Don‚Äôt take this cab company just can yellow cab their much nicer. If I could rate this zero stars I would"
6435,"I love anchorage parks, except for the one on Minnesota, that isn't a park that is dark place were bad things happen"
6436,Good pilot's
6437,"Good service, and amazing food."
6438,Very good place to eat
6439,They don't speak English well. I had to repeat myself over and over. Then the food sucked at $50. The flatulence lasted 2 days.
6440,Get outdoors and explore this magnificent area!
6441,Love this store for all my animal care and more. Highly recommend
6442,Best place for Firearms and Ammunition
6443,Great coffee with a view ‚úà

6447,"Friendly, helpful & knowledgeable staff, & everything is reasonably priced too. The best in town!"
6448,Delicious authentic Greek food great owner
6449,"So good we ate here twice! We were in Fairbanks for vacation and were so impressed by the prices that we came back. The food is great, the service is good and the selection of beer is outstanding. If you are looking for a local spot this is it, don't miss out."
6450,I thought I liked this store but the prices was higher than fredmyers or Wal-Mart forget this place
6451,We had horrible service but meal was good.
6452,"Stopped in for lunch on the recommendation of a friend. Had the koffta. It was delightful. I've been to Turkey and can say this is the best koffta I've had. Service is friendly but everything is made to order so it's a little wait, but we'll worth it!"
6453,"Reasonable price for a basic to good car wash.  No brushes, just high power water jets."
6454,"I like that place! All about anime, manga and other stuff"
6455,"Beer, Music, beer!"
6456,Nice displays and the ranger talk was very good

6465,Has a large variety of products in a very clean store
6466,"A regular go-to of mine. Only legitimately Chinese food on the island, as far as I can tell. Delivery is frequently prompt, and service with dining-in (when you can find a table) is always pleasant. Try the Singapore Fried Mai Fun. Their Oolong tea is the best out of the Asian restaurants on the island!"
6467,Friendly
6468,Doggie brushes; best dog food selection and cat toys; all the gear you need to walk it all the weather. And a wash your dog station only 20$ ...no grooming past the doggie wash
6469,Best selection of alcohol in Fairbanks
6470,"We were switched from the main hotel to the anex building at the beginning of our trip and it was older and was primarily oil rig workers hcaving training on site, we were placed across the hall from the training center and had loud work boots all the time.
The pillows were horrible, and the service wasn't great
It works for a fairly clean place to stay for one night close to the airport but would not stay for any length of time.
Also is located in not the nicest part of town"
6471,Good hotel in downtown fairbanks.
6472,tower of power concert
6473,A little expensive but they back it with their excellent job and customer service
6474,Great staff very helpful
6475,Good people!!!

6477,Most authentic bagel I have had since moving to Alaska.
6478,The people there are so sweet made me feel like I was home
6479,free wifi
6480,"Great service, nice people."
6481,It is a run of the mill McDonald's. Staff isn't overly impressive. The food is average. Their line does move faster than others.
6482,Very nice picnic and look out spot.
6483,Employee had to carry my merchandise to the register.  Second employee had to check my receipts at the door 30 seconds later.
6484,Good food
6485,Nice folks and a good variety of products.
6486,"This place deserves more recognition than it gets.  The portions are large and fairly priced as well as tasty.  I wasn't a fan of their tea as it had a sulfuric smell and their avocado seemed a little too ripe.  Minor issues in my mind, although I think those things can be improved.  The meat is good quality for bring a fast food joint."
6487,Always love eating here. It is a gema small town with some really good flavors and dishes incorporating seafood along with bold flavors. Never had a bad meal here.
6488,Super fun place to have a picnic and let the kids play on the beach and explore.
6489,"Pretty good food, I had the halibut but it is a locals place with that grunge feel.  Not a good date place üòâ"
6490,"The front desk person was helpful. If you are on the prepaid plans and bought your phone or sum elsewhere (ie walmart or big box store) they aren't empowered to do much with your account unless you've called the national customer service people and updated all your info.

Even still, the manager was more than apologetic and still quite helpful at easing the unfortunate news. I didn't have to purchase a new sym, which is awesome! And all I have to do is call them in the morning and get them to switch over my number via the main 800  customer service number.

Very pleasant, informative, not at all rude. A pleasure to interact with! üòÑ"
6491,"Nice, clean rooms"
6492,Great hike. Very hilly and beautiful
6493,It's always been a good store.
6494,Love it!
6495,"Too expensive, they used to have meat in their gravy; not worth it."
6496,The lady running the front was rude and chewed out an off duty employee that came in to order food then I was trying to ask for something and got ignored for five minutes before I was able to get her attention to be given  barely enough stuff to use
6497,Going thru the drive thru usually means you are on the go but to get the order wrong 3 times and still forget the honey mustard wth!!!!! MGT and staff need to be retrained!!!!
6498,Amazing service and the owners are super friendly!!!
6499,Great Stay.
6500,"This was my first time in a cannabis store. I have no desire to smoke weed, nor can I with the type of work I do, however, I went in looking for CBD products having no clue what I needed. Garrett saw me rolling toward the door in my wheelchair, opened it for me and I informed him this was my first time and I had no idea what I was doing. I was, however, hell bent on getting some gummies because that's what seemed ""normal"" to me. After explaining that not only was pain an issue from my recent ankle surgery, but at night I get anxiety and insomnia from ""cast claustrophobia"". He strongly recommended the drops, but he also recommended a lower dose than what the bottle suggested (maybe because I'm new to it?). I bought 2 bottles of the oil and one bag of gummies just to give them a try, but dollar for dollar, the drops are definitely more economically friendly. I took 12 drops with dinner and within an hour or so I felt chill AF and just a tad tired, like I'm about to have an amazing night's sleep. It could be the big day I had getting my stitches out and as new cast on, but I'm hoping it's the product working. Either way, the service was exceptional and the cost was acceptable. Very very happy and I'm sure I will be back if I truly see results! Thanks Garrett and Great Northern!"
6501,"I went to early to give this palace a fair rating
Will try again after 1230am"
6502,Beautiful
6503,Sometimes food is good. Workers are nice.
6504,Nice short spur off Chester Creek trail.
6505,Good place to go for a cheap carwash. $5 for 15min. Watch the time its $1 per extra min. If you take a long time I suggest to go back in pay 5 for another 15min. Or pay 10 for the basic wash in the automated washer
6506,"Great employees, all smiles."
6507,We had a blast. Memorial day.üòâüòäüëèüëèüëè
6508,Best pizza in Nome.  They even have Korean and sushi too
6509,"I love this joint!  With its red padded seating, string lighting and erstwhile decor, walking inside is almost like a trip back in time. Thorn's is probably best known for serving ""bucket of butt"" halibut meals, pouring stiff cocktails and displaying a large collection of vintage Jim Beam whiskey decanters."
6510,Always great food!
6511,Food wasn't that great and surprisingly expensive.
6512,Good deals
6513,"Another taco King, another good taco, just a good quality local chain. Fast fast fast service. Did I mention the service was fast? It was. And the food was fresh and hot. Always a solid choice for lunch or dinner take out for me."
6514,My daughter and I love this store and the candies are decadently delicious!!
6515,The food is really good. They have weird hours and I have no idea how to deal with the half-service thing they do.
6516,Was good we stayed when we went down fishing
6517,Amazing tunnel and history. Google it!
6518,Eh!
6519,Went for dinner. Food was not very good at all. I had the $20 hamburger and the meat was very greasy and my bun was completely soggy. Wife has the halibut and her mashed potatoes were all crusty and tasted old. This was once a great place to go for dinner. They have slipped considerably.
6520,Clean and Indepnet Room for both of Bath and Restroom. The view of Campground is great!
6521,Ice sculptures created by world champion ice artists!

6528,Good food.
6529,It was like any other bowling alley
6530,Great food as always.  I did miss getting my food on a regular plate.  It came out on a foam plate and drinks in paper cups!!!  Trying to save money?  It does not help the enviroment!!!
6531,Ok place small and not a lot of inventory
6532,Fast friendly service and great food.
6533,Reasonalby portioned food at an affordable price
6534,If you want to buy local this is the place
6535,Don't remember what that is??
6536,"Every time I come here it‚Äôs something new. They‚Äôve messed up my order a few times and service is slow. Just recently asked about salads because there‚Äôs none on the drive-thru menu, the guy got an attitude because I asked if they still sold them. Really I can‚Äôt ask a question without you being rude?? Then after I left I noticed they didn‚Äôt put any dressing in the bag or sauce for my nuggets. Wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if this was the first time it happened, it‚Äôs been a common occurrence."
6537,"AWESOME, delicious food.  Super fast and FRIENDLY service! LOVED IT ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
6538,The lady at the counter was fast. She allowed my son to rest for a minute we walked quite a bit on this day.
6539,I love love the authentic atmosphere and generosity
6540,"So much to do.scenery is great nice bike trails ,we like the rest spots.it is just all around great."
6541,"It was ok, but certainly not on my list of places to return."
6542,Great food and awsome service. Keep up the good work!.
6543,"Nice cabins there, but a unbeatable number of mosquitoes (the only place on our trip through Alaska). So we put up our tent inside."
6544,Typical Costco with all the great deals.
6545,Just a quick visit this time super friendly great prices . Super knowledgeable !! Thanks again
6546,Place for visitors
6547,Local Favorite
6548,The Bloody Marys are excellent! The food menu is limited but I've not ever been disappointed with the food. The only reason I give a 4 star instead of a 5 is that the service has been slow every time I've visited this place - even on days where there's not many patrons.
6549,"Good pizza fast delivery, but they always forget my sauses"
6550,Nice little off-road pit stop
6551,Yummy
6552,They have the best food in Copper River
6553,Didn't eat meat for four years till I ordered a black bear veggie burrito here today and took a bite of steak half way through. Usually I'm just served a ripped burrito that's mostly guacamole and deal with it but today sucked. Wish your kitchen staff would pay attention while working.
6554,The return of arcades! So much fun competing against your friends in a welcoming environment. Just charge a card and then reload it at the power station for hours of fun. There's a reason we live in Anchorage and not Soldotna... might as well enjoy the perks!
6555,Great ice cream
6556,LOVE IT HERE its my kinda DRFEELGOOD. WILL BE BACK FOR MORE DEFINITELY. CANT FORGET THE PEOPLES IN THERE GOTTA LOVE THEM. CHECK THEM OUT IF YOUR READI G THIS. ITS A 5‚≠ê.
6557,"Recently bought a box of SEAPOINT FARMS Edamame snack soybean pods.  I was ecstatic when I discovered that not only were the Non GMO, but also UNSALTED!  Have never found the unsalted before and am so glad I did, love edamame, but it is usually so salty I don't enjoy it.  These are PERFECT!  Of course when I returned to purchase more, they don't have them...tightened my jar!"
6558,Buy the wash pass!  Great savings.

6562,Service was great
6563,Great place for shopping everybody in the family can find what they need their

6565,Another Great Alaskan owned air taxi to get you to your destination. Great views from the flights. The pilots are amazing and the staff are always helpful.
6566,Always has just what I'm looking for. Employees are very helpful with any questions I have.
6567,"Love it, lots of supplies in the middle of nowhere"
6568,"Overpriced really! Sales folks are all the same! Walk in the door and boom ""Hello sir can I help you find something in particular""... I personally don't like the high pressure sales tactics!"
6569,"These folks never disappoint , kind compassionate, personable and very professional in every way!üëç‚ÄºÔ∏è"

6573,Always good every once in awhile
6574,All I can say is YUMMMMM
6575,My kind of place.
6576,"Visiting Anchorage and this place was recommended by a friend.  We sat in the bar seating, which had a really great ambiance. We tried the roasted garlic cambozola as an appetizer and split a hot italian sausage and mushroom, which were both good.  Both filled a party of two up. My boyfriend was ordering jack and cokes all night and I ordered the cadillac margarita, fireweed cosmo, pomegranate mojito, which were all very good (and not watered down ;) ). Service by Jessica was amazing. She attentive and very personable.  I will definitely come dine here again!"
6577,Spenard Roadhouse is our go to spot. The food is great and so are the drinks. Anyone who has dietary restrictions or preferences can easily find something great to it. There is a real chill vibe and the service is always good!
6578,What can you say? Comfort food. :-)
6579,Always awesome.  Love the food and great service
6580,"Every pizza I have ordered from here has always been fresh and hot.  Very good.  When my friends wants some and we are in the same area, always order this.  Well worth it, for me, every time."

6590,Good service
6591,"I try to like this place but 90% of the time I go there for specific stuff, they're out of stock of what I'm looking for. I went just yesterday for baby cereal, specific pacifier and rain boots, they had slots for all of them, they were just out. like they usually are. This happens most of the time. The staff is hit or miss in the courteous area. I'd rather pay more and get what I need at Fred Meyers."

6599,Great food and awesome views
6600,"Delicious  pancakes, and breakfast  plates!"
6601,Beautiful.
6602,Food was phenomenal... that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars.  Props to the cook.  However the service was EXTREMELY slow and when asking for certain things they never came.  We sat with our water glasses empty for 20 min. Waited another 45 min for the check.  We also went at 2pm so they weren't all that busy.  Pretty disappointing.
6603,"Best Buy, Sam's Club, Target, Kohls, Lowe's and lots of shops."
6604,"We waited in a long line, ordered food inside, waited about 10 mins for lukewarm food. Not worth the drive for mediocre food."
6605,"Wonderful place tucked into a cozy spot downtown. Delicious and flavorful foods that give you that amazing authentic home cooked feel. You feel like you are eating your Moldovan grandma‚Äôs cooking. They have a great selection of appetizers, salads and main meals. The soup I had was also delicious. They have a beer and wine menu and also have espresso and coffee drinks. Check it out today, you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
6606,"Awesome breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. I would include a picture, but I already ate it."
6607,A wide variety of options and there is also a board of ice cream combination ideas. You can order specialty cakes or walk in and choose a cake from their display freezer. Samples of their ice cream can be tasted before deciding. Downside is plan to stand in line for a bit and don't rely on being able to sit inside to enjoy your ice cream treat because it's extremely small and the line takes up most of the space.
6608,Terrible loads of people
6609,The staff is attentive and they always seem to have what I want.
6610,Bacon Jam burger was a superb recommendation from the waiter. Makes a welcome break from the Mooses Tooth.
6611,Always fun

6617,"We were not expecting much from Fast Eddy's but they are a true gem.  Conveniently located right off of the ALCAN, plenty of parking, amazing food (portions and quality!) and a very nice staff.  If you are making the trip up or down, and will be around Tok I highly recommend you stop here for grub!!!!"
6618,"Pizza was great.  Not a big fan of the meatball sandwich, plus it didn't count towards rewards.  I'll stick with pizza in the future."
6619,Savanna assisted me in getting the right parts for the dishwasher she sold me and gave me important advice. She's good. Promote that woman.  Thanks.
6620,They helped me finance my vehicle and I paid it off with there understanding and flexible staff and accounting.
6621,Great place for family and group picnics.  Covered area with picnic tables.  It may be windy on sunny days so take a light jacket. Kids can Wade in the water and their is a kid friendly playground. You can fish from the shore or on the Dimond side of the lake from a dock.

6626,Nice place. Decent prices. Mostly went in to find a bathroom. They have some on the second floor near the elevator. Took a while to find a staff member though.

6631,Little shop with all the merchandise
6632,Northeay mall Next Door!
6633,"Delicious barbecue! I waited too long to stop by and give this place a chance. Brandon and Shawn are awesome and make some awesome food. Their ribs were very much falling off of the bone and perfectly seasoned. Their pulled pork sandwich was also very good! There are always people there for a reason! In addition to taste, their prices are very fair, especially for the Seward area. Give these guys a shot and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
6634,I love the nice employees and how helpful they are
6635,Good service
6636,What are the best transmission builders in Alaska.
6637,Had to make one burger again do to missing the no mayo request but they do a fantastic job each visit and beat BK or McDonald's hands down! O-rings over fries everyday!
6638,"I waited the normal 45min for my pizza, ordered and paid for extra cheese and when I got home to my pizza there was so little cheese on it that I could see the sauce and crust through the cheese. Pretty much ordered pizza and got dough with sauce and pepperoni on it. I don't know why now a days you can't just get what you order and pay for. Thanks"
6639,Always hoppin! Love my Super store
6640,40 plus $ for 2 burritos. And a soda... you got to be kidding  someone but not me I canceled the order and drove away couldn't believe the price ... sorry to say I didn't get to try the food but wow just wow ...so taco bell it was
6641,Great place but very smoky from fires.
6642,Try to wait til Spring is actually over due to the thaw and random poop that needs to be thrown away or careful if it turns to fertilizer over time.
6643,Food tasted better compared to other subways in the area.
6644,"I always missed having an Italian beef and sausage sandwich at a place called Steamboats (RIP).  When I saw that Johnny Chicago's had this, and that they actually used Vienna Beef sausages, I was all in."
6645,"What can I say? A fun bowling alley with beer. Have only been here for night bowling and had a blast. Lots of contests and giveaways going on.

Everything was clean and the staff was attentive. Prices are not all that bad either.

Dress up with white for the black lights!"
6646,Great place to eat!
6647,Way better then footlocker and cheaper better selections and awesome colors choices
6648,Beautiful skies with beautiful scenery and the best coach driver.   Thanks Cal....

6650,Great fun nice people working but need a couple of machine fo fixed
6651,The parking lot is not fun to drive on
6652,"Good variety, healthy portions. The wait staff were particularly accommodating; my party arrived toward the end of the night, but you'd never know it. They were friendly, patient, and helpful to the first timer in the group."
6653,Love it
6654,Great pizza and beer! Very nice staff and cozy inside.
6655,"Not the best quality of clothes ,but if look harder, you can find some really good staff there.Clearance sales are super good! Also after seasonal sales great as well"
6656,Very good place I recommend it
6657,Pretty good food and the service was great! The outside may look a little outdated but the good makes up for it. Try the Curry Fried Rice! It is great!!

6660,Phenomenal! Must stop. You can walk up and touch the glacier. So cool.
6661,Highly recommended
6662,Packed parking lot...busy place. Very helpful.
6663,"Of all the places to eat in Anchorage, this place should be on your list. I'm not one for reservations, so what we do is we sit on the bar side. It is more casual over there and you don't need a reservation. They serve the full menu plus a bar menu there. They also have some really nice window seats so you can see the pretty view. Their fish and chips are amazing. Hands down the best coleslaw I have EVER had. The lavender martini is awesome as well. I also recommend the salmon bisque. So good. We even bring the kids with us to sit on the bar side, which isn't frowned upon. They have kids coloring mats and always treated us nicely there. The best part is the kid's meals are amazing. They get fresh fruit pretty much right after you order, which is good since kids need that distraction. The meal options are healthy, include unlimited drinks and an ice cream sundae at the end. All for the same price as any other restaurant in town. You simply can't beat this place. I have never had a bad experience and we go every time we drive through town."
6664,"Poor customer service, the lady screamed at me because she forgot the plastic ware. In front of all their guests."
6665,"Typical AAFES Mall, they have all the same vendors."
6666,Awesome service
6667,Just fantastic. Great food. I really appreciate it.
6668,Raphael and his team were amazing courteous swift and kind. Would recommend them for anyone needing to have junk quickly and effectively removed from their property.
6669,Totally volunteer owned and maintained. Heathy place for the kids.
6670,Nice quiet place
6671,"Seemed like a tired or uninspired staff at Lands End & it's restaurant, The Chart Room.  I describe it as ho hum."
6672,Delicious food...
6673,Love this place. Feels like a healthy meal.
6674,Beautiful gallery and some lovely pieces!
6675,"Food is barely above average, service is a little below average. Better than mcdonalds though."
6676,Very interesting.
6677,The brews are fantastic!!
6678,"They have a very friendly staff that were very competent.  I love their system of being able to fill out paperwork online before you get there.  They print it out for you and all you have to do is sign it.  I saw a sign that said they do complimentary neck massage, have massage chairs, etc, but I wasn't offered any of that.  I certainly didn't need it though.  I had Dan as my hygienist and Dr. Mishler as my dentist.  Both were great and I had a very nice experience.  The front office staff have been very friendly and helpful as well.  Overall, definitely a place I would recommend."
6679,Waited very little time and the young man who helped me discovered that I was unable to get 5G service because I don't have an unlimited plan? This is a disappointment
6680,This particular store seems easier to park and to shop than other stores I've been to...
6681,It's my absolute favorite place to go.
6682,Legit sandwiches.
6683,Prejudice people working there.
6684,Great
6685,Need to keep the spicy chicken tenders
6686,Huge selection of drinks. And different ones too. I had a sandwich and it was very flavorful and filling.
6687,Friendly fast and clean
6688,Best sushi in Anchorage!
6689,Bright shiny people
6690,"Open 24hrs, uses quarters, lots of bays."
6691,It's a family traditional place to eat.
6692,"Recommended by locals as the best wine cellar in town, it was already setup for disappointment. I mean it wasn't a bad wine list, but it wasn't anything special to the point that you could order most of the selection off your local big box wine retail store.

And while the staff were refreshing (Pablo was excellent and candid), knowing only the ""fresh halibut"" special was fresh and that the regular on-menu halibut couldn't be guaranteed as fresh was a sign of the menu's limits on freshness.

Also, umm, yeah, the elephant in the room. Alaska's idea of COVID-19 safety may not be your idea of COVID-19 safety, let's just leave it at that."
6693,Daily fresh made bread and delicious treats!
6694,Great selection and staff. Prices are SOSO.
6695,food was ok. room was dirty and smelled funny
6696,Friendly
6697,Only game in town for amusement type parks.... Does not compare to what the lower 48 has but for Fairbanks I give it 4. Could use some updates and new attractions.
6698,Clean and pleasantly organized
6699,"Great service, great food will eat there again"
6700,I was able to renew my drivers license thank you DMV for putting up with me an letting me take my test I had to take in order for me to drive
6701,Nice mom and pop. Food is awesome
6702,Good coffee great smiles good people
6703,"The salesman who helped me was very helpful, because he answered all of my technical questions and even went in depth in his answers. The location is convenient and they have lots of parking spaces for the busy times of year."
6704,Great staff. Appreciated how much knowledge  they had for buying a electric rolling machine for the first time. And what kind of tobacco to get that's similar to the brand I smoke.
6705,It's nice. It's gotten better in the past 4 years... The staff is friendlier and the food is getting better.
6706,Love to bring the kids here and walk around combing the beach or fly kites with the family!
6707,It's usually really quiet here my mom used to own a store it was really slow but there's some nice stores in here I would suggest checking it out if you have time.
6708,"Great gear, great service."
6709,"Staff is great, all the way from the driver to the desk clerks. Very helpful!"
6710,"Good service, Great pizza!"
6711,Lots of parking
6712,Great people
6713,Staff is rude and the food was fairly okay.
6714,Shop at carrs and save hella money on gas. Them rewards really add up. So far I've only gotten full tanks at carrs cause I shop there often and just wait to spend the gas rewards. Usually it's about 60-90 cents off the gallon by the time I need to get more gas.
6715,If u didn't drive away with a different car you are still under pressure of I don't know what I want!!!
6716,Terrible food
6717,I love this bar its the only one I know since I was younger
6718,"Morris Auto Detail has exceeded my expectations! The staff are very friendly and professional, and the owners are a fantastic team! My '15 CR-V was trashed by my kids, and now there is no sign that I have kids. Looks newer than when I drove it off the lot new. I highly recommend Morris, you won't be disappointed!"
6719,Maybe my favorite place in Anchorage to eat. Sit at the Kitchen bar to watch some chefs in action making your food. I had the clams and loved every bite and slurp. Will definitely return many times.
6720,Fun fishing good friendly guys to fish buy
6721,"Always do a great job,  quick oil change and check out fluids and filter."
6722,Be nice if I won more often.
6723,"Very pleasant, staff was very helpful."
6724,Great salsa! The spicy one really kicks. Super friendly service.
6725,"Always on point with there pizza, and overall goodness"
6726,great browsing.
6727,The bomb‚ô°
6728,All you can eat buffet with friendly service
6729,Very nice
6730,Great service and Burgers!
6731,"Stay away from this place, they are the worse dealership I've ever dealt with. This place is filled with bad salesman and even worse service reps. I've been lied to so many times here, it's not even funny. I had a service manager lie to me about parts that were supposedly replaced that weren't. I caught him by taking before and after pics of the parts. He was eventually fired but, it took a long time before that happened. I took my Dodge Ram to them while under warranty and then never returned for years until I got an airbag recall notice. It had been several years since my last visit but absolutely nothing has changed. They told me the replacement work would take only an hour or so & my vehicle would be done by noon, it wasn't done until the next day. They tried up selling me on repair work that the mechanic noticed while it was there, $1500 worth of routine  maintenance items? No thanks Gene's. I have a mechanic that'll do the work for over half that and guess what? He stands behind his work, unlike Gene's that stand behind nothing. Except how to make another dollar off their customers and screw them any way they can! I've lived in Fairbanks for 20 years now and everyone I know hold the same opinion of Gene's. They are a bunch of shysters &  crooks. Avoid this place at all costs!!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
6732,"Great food, great service. Delicious selection!!"
6733,"I usually make my espresso at home, but when I need a coffee while out I go to Kaladi's. Looks like the nearby Starbucks is hurting their business, not as packed as it used to be. Support local, especially when the product is better."
6734,12/5 great establishment
6735,Just the fact of the service
6736,Favorite dive bar.
6737,Come back every time we visit.
6738,Seems to always have what I need.
6739,Went in for lunch i had nachos which were delicious the kid doing condiments had a big frown the entire time he clearly didn't want to be there and was not doing a very good job either he was rude to my wife when she asked for salsa and was wrapping burritos horribly my wife's came apart and had to be eaten with a fork.
6740,Great breakfast!
6741,Beautiful bear's
6742,Everytime I go in to a joanns the customer service is horrible.
6743,pizza is okay if you receive what you order.
6744,Best pizza ever!! Also the chicken wings are delicious. If you haven‚Äôt tried the freak you MUST stop here on your road trip and grab something to eat
6745,Good food! Loved my beef fried rice
6746,"It's taco Bell it's major downside is that it takes forever to go through the drive through at times, and the parking lot in general is a but funky otherwise it's a cool place."
6747,"The appointment for our dog was at 9:30 AM. We were scheduled to pick him up at 2:00 PM. Around noon she remembered an appointment she had to go to at 1:00 so the scheduled time to pick our dog up changed to 3:00. We arrived to pick our dog up at 3 and knocked on her door, called her phone that went unanswered, and rang her doorbells (she has three) for 5 minutes before she yelled that she would have our dog ready in 10 minutes. We kept being told it would just be a few more minutes. At 4:40 she finally allowed us to reclaim our dog. It was a very distressing situation. After all of that, the haircut was awful, it is all uneven and she missed several spots. Horrible groomer, terrible experience, please take your beloved pups elsewhere."
6748,The owner is very knowledgeable and friendly. I've gotten some beautiful jewelry here. She'll even take custom orders.
6749,"I thought the food was sort of soggy, and the taste was not to great. Furthermore, it gave me a stomach ache afterword... üòß Although, the server was very nice, which is the only reason I gave it some stars."
6750,Can‚Äôt talk this place up enough.... you won‚Äôt regret going and then going again:) Delicious!!
6751,"It has delicious food every day.
Also you can get. Food to go"
6752,Nice little farmers market with the nicest people offering their goods and service. Check out the popcorn stand. Is the best popcorn I ever eat here in the states.
6753,"We walked in and a vehicle was purchased that same day. The staff was very professional and it was a relief to meet Jonathan (unsure of spelling) who was extremely kind and honest as well. I'm extremely happy with the way my family members were treated, especially with the horrible treatment they received from a salesman from a dealership on the same street. Will definitely recommend Jonathan and this dealership to all future family and friends :)"
6754,Best fish tacos ever!!
6755,This is the best burger joint in town.
6756,"This place will treat you nice until you go to pick up your vehicle. After waiting an hour just to shake the hand of the person who sold me the truck online I finally get to see it and see it had not been washed. Then I got in and found kid toys and empty cigarette packs showing me they didn't bother cleaning the inside of the truck either. I sit there for a few min looking it over to get familiar with the dash and controls since they felt that hour I sat on their couch was better spent doing nothing. I start the truck up to find out the tank is half empty. You would think when you spend over $47,000 for a truck it should be clean and have a full tank of fuel. When my temp tags were about to expire I called up and asked about my new plates. I was told they were there waiting for me to pick up. No one decided to let me know. Since I live on an island in Alaska I told them they better hurry and send me the plates since they didn't bother to tell me they were in or send them out as soon as they got them. They had my full address and instructions from when I bought the truck. But I guess that is not how this place does business. I'd look elsewhere for a vehicle. They are nice until they have your money."
6757,"The Harbor was just a Harbo, but our Ferryboat was amazing"
6758,Beautiful art & community
6759,What a great place to visit. The guides are very knowledgeable!
6760,"Because christmas is a depressing time for a single guy,  Lowes had baby christmas trees for 25$ that are appropriate for my home."

6762,Go strictly for the dog park.

6768,"Services at the location tend to be great, the staff is helpful and informative. Regular maintenance is pretty hassle free with the online scheduling. The car wash is great. I had a frustrating incident with calling in the past, but the management reached out and seems to try to do well and improve. Kudos."

6787,If you like basketball. This is a good place to go. Some places have few brands of shoes and some have more brands.

6789,People obviously don't wear hair nets. There was hair on my food today. Last I went I asked for well done and got a pink on the inside steak. I would not recommend anyone to go there.
6790,You will need a car to get out there and spend time wandering around.

6812,Great pizza place in Sitka.  We did take out.  Two nice salads and the Mean Queen pizza
6813,"DMVs are notorious for their slow speed. I came here with my paperwork filled out ahead of time (I would highly recommend doing this as it saves a lot of time), and when it was my turn, I was finished within five minutes.

There was a wait time, as is always the case, but the Valley location is much better than other ones I've been to. It would be nice if the waiting area was a bit larger, but at least there is a camera on the website so you know if it's worth going there at the moment."

6819,Ice art festival 2019 was okay. Ice sculptures were amazing as usual but the event keeps getting smaller. We were just frustrated that we paid all that money and they didnt have the slides finished. What a waste of money. Call ahead if you have kids and want slides!

6835,"Good grief! There is a very good reason they have 4.8 stars after nearly 200 reviews: WONDERFUL BURGERS!  The Kenai Killer was superb!   But don't believe the 6PM closing - they close when they run out of stuff, which can be before 5PM on pretty days.  Get there by 430PM at the latest! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

Somehow a couple orders were messed up, but the server swiftly fixed the issue and brought out some extra food to make up for the mistake. I'll be going back with my family and friends in the future."

I was always treated with respect and dignity by their whole staff.(Laura & Lisa are great) I would recommend this firm to anyone that is need of legal services. I felt like they were respected at the court house which in my eyes is big if you are trying for the best possible outcome for your situation.

6885,Better than Dennys
6886,Rooms are gorgeous and very comfy.
6887,Delicious
6888,"We have two yorkies and we shop here for their dog food. They have a very wide selection from entry level dog food to organic/raw products. The staff is very knowledgeable and will help you choose the best product for your animal. Prices are very reasonable, even competetive with Amazon, which in Alaska rarely happens. I would recommend shopping here."
6889,Great food
6890,The garlic shrimp banzai bowl was amazing!! Great taste and fast service! Sorry about my picture.... It was so good that I took a picture of what's left Haha definitely recommend!
6891,"Wonderful Food, Wonderful Service"
6892,My shop for the needed oil change!
6893,Cheaper than Ninilchik
6894,There food is awesome especially oriental salad and philly cheese sandwich
6895,$3 beer and a full $13 prime rib dinner Thursday
6896,Great food but it is expensive. They need to adjust their co2 as well. Our beers (we tried 3) were all flat...
6897,Great breakfast plus the workers there are always in good spirits!
6898,my husband loves this place
6899,Good place
6900,The people always think you're conning them. Renting from these people is rough.
6901,"Always the best food, and fast delivery. Lo mein is to die for and the egg foo young is the best I have ever had anywhere.."
6902,"An excellent variety of teas, condiments, spices, and snacks you can't find anywhere else!"
6903,"Super cool location to pull over for a quick camera shoot.  Two bits of caution on a windy day...
First hold the car door as you open it!
Second, hold onto the little ones of they could end up like Piglet holding onto his blanket as he flies away."
6904,Service was great and quick.
6905,"Bus stop too far, 1 mile away. No grocery stores nearby."
6906,We let them know when we would be there and they welcomed us with a cold beer and a hot bowl of chili. It's the best chili in Tolsona! Nice camping spot for our van overnight. We wish we could have stayed longer!
6907,Lovely location
6908,Let's party!
6909,"Great breakfast deals to pick up before work. Good prices, great donuts, great biscuits n gravy."
6910,"I work at Suite 100. We make our food and sauces from scratch. Awesome seafood, steaks, and ribs. Best ribs in town. Kobe burger, regular and kids burgers. Unbelievable house-made deserts. Really nice bar and lounge. Make reservations. Seafood chowder and soup of the day."
6911,I like the birthday cakes here taste better then cars
6912,Says coffee is. 25.  Well we paid $1.50 each! For bad coffee too
6913,"Good food, reasonable prices"
6914,"Coffee was quick, wrong and weak"
6915,They helped me adopt out my dogs when i was unable to provide for them.
6916,"In short: Amazing food, large potions, and fair price.
I got the pork fried rice and the CKN porkbelly and it was delicious. Although the porkbelly was fantastic the fried rice was the star for me. The fried rice's portion is enough to probably satisfy two people. The place was clean, waiter/waitress was kind and chill, and most importantly, the food was great. I would definitely recommend this place to any asian food enthusiasts and has become my go-to for fried rice. Trust me, it's that good."
6917,"An awesome re-use of an old Spenard landmark, magically transformed into a haven for creatives. Art studios for rent,performance spaces, community activities...."
6918,"absolutely the worst college I've been to. Parking is a joke even after paying for an expensive parking pass, still cant park during certain times in the day or if you're there too long you get fines all the time. I was told by the advisor for business that I shouldn't go to college because she didn't believe I was smart enough for college because I failed the first year. After writing a letter for approval explaining that my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer is the reason I failed the first year of college, she said she would accept me for the business degree but didn't even apologize for her attitude. I declined UAA for the second year and went to ALASKA PACIFIC UNIVERSITY. Where I currently got my associates in Accounting with a 3.0 GPA, and love the teachers I've had so far and my advisor keeps up to date with me and helps me every semester choosing classes. DONT GO TO UAA UNLESS NURSING OR ENGINEERING because that's apparently all they care about if you haven't seen the spending they use for those specific degrees only."
6919,The springs were amazing and the staff was friendly.
6920,Fast haircuts. Not amazing but she gets you in and out in a good time
6921,"It's a clean good 3 floor mall, but outside is full of homeless people asking for change."
6922,Very good place.
6923,Live this fair.  Great personnel.
6924,Beautiful
6925,Service is always great
6926,Excellent customer service and masterful skill with the installs.
6927,"(Translated by Google) Very decadent structure, lacking in maintenance and dirty. Staff not efficient. Breakfast just enough. Ultimately not recommended.

(Original)
Struttura molto decadente, carente di manutenzione e sporca. Personale non efficiente. Colazione appena sufficiente. In definitiva sconsigliato."
6928,They still have the best dip cones. My kids love them.
6929,For all the hard to find wilderness stuff's
6930,They really understand and know cars.
6931,"I love this place ! The guys are great knowledgeable ,and friendly!"
6932,Fair prices and great subs!!
6933,I found there's better places around
6934,"A little disapointing as far as the wildlife. ""The Last Frontier"" didn't provide any bear or moose sightings. Large salmon were swimming upspring though and we saw a bald eagle and ducks."
6935,Dive bar in Anchortown .. Friday night it‚Äôs crowded and loud .. dancing poles available to any female patrons that feel the need .. and Sunday‚Äôs quiet with sports and pot lucks ...
6936,Very friendly staff and great prices!
6937,"Loved it! My daughter picked our breakfast spot and it was amazing! The food and service was great. Filled with locals, this little beauty had some thing for everyone.  Great coffees and coffee drinks as well as chai. The monkey bread looked amazing but in an effort to fit into my jeans, i went with the harvest hash and fried egg, my daughter had the spicy green chili breakfast burrito.  We left stuffed! Great experience...i will be back."
6938,Auto stores aren't exciting but the counter man pointed out what I needed etc. so I was content.
6939,"This is a top 3 hike to do around Anchorage along with Reed Lake and Rabbit Lake.  Beautiful hike with outstanding vistas of Ravens glacier at the end. If you traverse the snow field and climb over the black rocks you can stand on Ravens glacier which is an exhalarating experience.   Lots of wild life . We saw Tarmigans, mountain goats and some cute artic  squirrels. Moderate hike without the traverse to Ravens glacier."
6940,Its for tourists or buying gifts. Has gone down hill since the 1st time i visited this place
6941,Great deals and selection
6942,Very good service. Great food.
6943,No working thermostat or room control temperature. Too hot.  Funny to say that Alaska. Couldn't check in till after three.
6944,"Amazing. Great service, very clean, very professional, and did a great job with lashes!"
6945,I had never eaten here before. I took a leap based on the reviews and ordered Moussaka for lunch. Absolutely amazing.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.
6946,Loved the train ride and the man who sings in the front. It was very informative to learn all about the pipeline and gold mining.
6947,Not so much
6948,Not bad...not my favorite...
6949,gym and swimming!!
6950,"I didnt hate the 5th Avenue Mall, I thought it was an awesome mall!üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
6951,"Excellent service, great prices and very helpful staff."
6952,Amazing glacial lake. Insanely cold. Dress warmly if you're headed out kayaking! A great stop to hike or paddle
6953,"Clean, welcoming, lots of space. Would stay there again."
6954,Very close to the park.  Wifi is there but not good for much more than checking Facebook.  Campsite is just a gravel lot
6955,AWESOME+++
6956,"Great ice cream,  only bad thing was a long line."
6957,Nice place
6958,"Hands down the best pizza in Anchorage. For someone who travels a lot and a True New Yorker, This is what pizza is suppose to taste like. This place is 2nd behind NYC with the pizza. The portions is just right it is not thick. Quality and you get a large take out for $9.99. Worth the money and the taste. This is the only place I order my pizza from. To those who haven‚Äôt eaten here before you won‚Äôt regret it best pizza. I haven‚Äôt ate anything else but I can vouch for the pizza üçïüòãüòãüòãüòã"
6959,My favorite.
6960,"Great place to stop for gas, easy in and out. They keep it clean, cleared of snow and have wash buckets with squeegees and towels, always a plus in my book. Their prices are always competitive if not cheaper then the other stations in town and if you are a Fred Meyers shopper you can earn points to lower your price by ten cents a gallon and it‚Äôs easy to do."
6961,Love this place!!!
6962,Loved it
6963,"Everything on the menu is delicious, the atmosphere is cozy, and the staff is inviting. Eat the doughnuts! Just go for it!"
6964,Typical Mall
6965,Brown bags weekday afternoons and homeless lunch Saturday at 11am and Sunday 1130am
6966,Interesting place .. They have some unique items for sure.
6967,"Cheap seafood, out-of-the-ordinary snacks, quality produce, and deli portions fit for a giant!"
6968,"Always a blast to go to. Try the dipped ice cream bars, wear a medium jacket, wear supportive shoes and bring lots of cash!"
6969,"The food was ok, the service was terrible. 20 minutes for drinks, an hour for food, and both orders were wrong. I would save your money, or spend it on gas to go to a better place. I won't be making that mistake again."
6970,Good place for long-term service records. I'll keep coming.
6971,This historical hotel (from 1927) is often the cheapest place in Ketchikan so it's okay. The WiFi unfortunately ain't all that great but the cable TV works well and there are a bunch of HBO channels. Annabelle's Restaurant on the ground floor has reasonably priced burgers ($13-16). The staff here is friendly and helpful
6972,Great tour.  I live I town and have done many of the tours in town.  Super cool.
6973,Very friendly owner!
6974,"A bit pricey but great cold brew, delicious cookies and amazing sandwiches! Toilet is very clean and they have free wifi.
Staff is very friendly."
6975,Great coffee
6976,My wife and I come here often. Always wonderful.
6977,Serrano's. Is. Addicting. Once you start you can't stop. Everything on your plate is ABSOLUTELY flavorful and delicious. The customer service is always on point. I have ordered here numerous times (dine in/pick up/delivery) and have yet to be disappointed.
6978,Foods is phenomenal and authentic  Owner is also the Chef and he is the sweetest man.  Always comes out to see if you enjoyed your meal.
6979,Service was poor and the order was wrong
6980,I can't say enough about the views at Hatcher Pass Lodge. My husband and I stopped in to dine at the restaurant one day for lunch. We had been out hiking Hatcher's Pass and happened to see the lodge and noticed there was a restaurant. The views from our table were magnificent. We enjoyed out meals as well. The staff was very accommodating and friendly.
6981,Great Food and Service.
6982,Great little place.  I find the staff very friendly and always helpful.  The food is great.  They get my vote.
6983,Subpar for arby's. There orders are accurate most the time but half empty curalys and skimpy cheese cups are common.
6984,Excellent customer service and great drinks
6985,Its all Good!
6986,Uses cheap sauce and old food
6987,"What a pleasant park setting!  Duck ponds, too (don't feed the ducks!).  Clean, inviting, well-maintained."
6988,5 dollar pizzas can't beat it
6989,"They seem awfully disorganized And when they get busy it seems like they don't have enough waitresses or waiters.
We had to wait a long time after we were sat at our table
Not intrested in going back there"
6990,Enjoyed my experience @ checkout with cashier in training --Helen! Pleasant gal*
6991,"Great service. Every time I go here, my issue is resolved and sometimes my bill gets cheaper.  Disclaimer: I work (indirectly) for GCI."
6992,To many people walking around.
6993,Good food as always. Quick on the weekdays. A little crazy on the weekends
6994,"Amazing, fast , and friendly service. Great prices as well!"
6995,"Ummmm do you like biscuits & gravy? Cause my husband loves B & G and he definitely wants to visit again! This little gem is a must visit, with fast and personable service. The ladies were great as was the food! Benny and Heartbreaker were our slections and I now want to try everything on the menu. Go visit, this place is a great brunch spot."
6996,Happy to visit and buy what we needed. Too bad they won't be around much longer.
6997,Hate their building and parking!! Have a real main door! Steps and seats are terrible (everything is loose and/or damaged). Parking structure (vehicle entrance and exit ia awful. No dividers and no walk ways. 2 stars instead of 1 because it doesnt atleast leak.
6998,A man yelled at people for smoking tho
6999,"Not Drone Friendly (multiple signs on the main door forbidding drones - maybe it's because of the flight seeing tours, not sure as signs did not explain). It seems that you can only reach the glacier if you pay these guys (organized tours are 100$/person - what!?! - and non guided tours are 25$/person or 20 if you are a resident)."
7000,"Much better than mcds and burger king and the like.. great for a chain. A bit more expensive but the food is more substantial and more flavorful. As well as being better prepared. Makes it worth the bit of a price increase. Just bring an appetite or maybe think about sharing truth a friend of significant other.. it's genuinely difficult to finish a whole meal.. and even though it's cheaper fast food, I still hate wasting it.."
7001,Yummy food and good prices
7002,"The staff was very friendly and the course was extremely clean.
Very happy with my visit!

Thanks Omalleys on the green!
I will continue to do business with you guys!"
7003,Great dive bar!
7004,Tuesday's Kids eat free with adult purchase!
7005,Great produce dept.
7006,Everyone is Very friendly and helpful.  I personally do most of my shopping at Fred Meyer's as Carr's has gotten too expensive .
7007,"A wonderful community theater - they're always showing something interesting, is available for rental, and are often showing FREE, community-based/conversation-oriented movies."
7008,Great place!
7009,Great place to pick up souvenirs.
7010,Great service and selection ....Best in the Area !
7011,Good comfort food.
7012,Just make sure to check the expiration dates. . Other than that it's okay
7013,It was the best pizza I had in a very long time
7014,"Now I remember why we stopped going. We hadn't been in forever, but had a gift card so figured why not.
Nothing on the menu jumped out as, ""oooh  I want that"", more of an ""I guess that might be ok"". My 'chook chicken"" sandwich was not good, not bad, just meh. Though they *did* get the bacon crispy, as requested-something many places have no success doing.
The famous blooming onion tasted like used fry oil, well, until I peeled off the crust. The actual onion tasted ok, just the coating was blah."
7015,Beautiful
7016,"We always take our visitors here never disappointed the colder the better and we got -20, always enjoy the bar too:)"
7017,"Excellent food and great service. Expensive, but worth the price. Excited for their seasonal menu!"
7018,Staff is okay. The products are worth dealing with the staff.
7019,"Helpful staff easy to navigate the layout, deli could be improved but still has solid selection"
7020,Loved the pastry
7021,Good food small place fun to eat there .not hot on bikers
7022,They always have the most knowledgeable and helpful staff it's always a pleasure to go in there as a woman and get treated properly and get the parts you need and just what you need
7023,"I like this store for the layout of product aisles and fresh food from the deli, also has a wide range of produce including a large organic selection."
7024,What can you say when you win a free pie!And they always keep your cup warm.
7025,Awesome pizza!
7026,Nice park along a trail and there is access to the water
7027,"After many many years of life on east end road it is time we talk about the Fritz Creek general store. I went in today to buy a cup of soup. I wear a mask, I am nice and I live just right up the road. I get handed my soup, once again by the grumpiest kitchen employee. And then I check the mailbox and for the third time in 3 months my package has been ripped open. Luckily, the contents remained. The first time someone had swiped my pricey shampoo. The second time contents remained but there was a note and a fake Louis Vuitton wallet.....what the heck, Fritz? Oh and when you pay, a totally disgruntled cashier. Now believe me, I understand that sometimes poop hits the fan and we all have a bad day once-in-a-while. But this grumpiness is systemic and pro-longed. Bring back customer service and quit opening my packages!"
7028,I don't like shopping there but it's possible that sometimes they have things that I need or rather want I really don't need anything there
7029,Love this place!!!
7030,"My family loves this place. We have an annual pass and it never gets old walking the beautiful trails. It is free, however, unless you have an annual pass ($50), parking each visit is $5. We visited more than 10x each year so the pass is worthwhile."
7031,"A small little restaurant that is hidden right off the road. The place is big enough to seat about 20 people in it. The customer service is great and the food is great and not overly priced. I had the special for the day which was the Crack burger, this was a very tasty burger, and wasn't greasy at all. I loved this burger because usually this type of burger the buns are soaked with grease, but this wasn't. The desserts are made in house I believe which also tasted great. A decent parking lot, 1 bathroom, and lots of decor to look at on the walls while you eat."
7032,"I like breakfast, best part of the meal. Lots to choose from. Delious."
7033,Still looking for value counter top s
7034,Friendly service!
7035,No review.
7036,Major fire on 20 Dec 2020. May not be open for a while.
7037,One of the better Safeway's I have been too.
7038,Very helpful
7039,Some good deals.
7040,"Decent for the price and in a good location (basically in the Home Depot parking lot). Bed was very uncomfortable and the bathroom wasn't dry. The toilet, sink, etc. were covered in cleaning product. Our stay was pleasant overall."
7041,Checkout clerks were checked out. I was an inconvenience.
7042,"Has mostly everything you need at one location. If one Walmart doesn't have it, another will."
7043,Absolutely beautiful
7044,The doctor is amazing! Very fun and relatable. Covid practices seem sound. Would highly recommend.
7045,"Good people, great prices. Good work for the community."
7046,Excellent plan e to visit
7047,An excellent place to eat ice cream. I just wish the road wasn't so narrow to get here.
7048,Love Costco.
7049,Good breakfasts!
7050,"Best service, terrific food"

7067,Nice to stay at Harbour  Side Hotel
7068,Awesome place
7069,I loved Ketchikan. It is a fantastic place!
7070,"Good menu, great food and awesome pizza"
7071,"Only place to eat in town, like literally in the winter that's all we got. Very good food for sure. At least our only restaurant is a good one lol"
7072,Their produce and meat is so much better than fred meyer..i cant believe i was shopping at freds for the last year.  Plus their gas station is a lot more convenient to get to.   I switched.
7073,AMAZING food! My steak was perfect and huge. So was my Hubbys. Salad was perfect. Hidden gem in the woods. Cant say enough. WE WILL BE BACK! and we will bring friends too.
7074,Not busy get in get out
7075,"Fast service, our food was done in 10 minutes, the wait staff was fantastic, always coming by to ensure everyone is satisfied! Nice atmosphere too, loved the bear pictures on the wall!"
7076,Big selections of liquor/wine bottles and beers. Great place for tourists.
7077,Nice
7078,Great food
7079,"Always a great experience with fun people! Only downside, busy( thats a good thing!), Make an appointment if you can!‚ô° I didnt get to get my eyebrows done with how busy they were, even with an appointment, ill have to go back another day ‚ô°"
7080,"The number one place to manually wash your vehicle. Clean place the management is always on top, workers on the premises helping and making sure things are working properly.  Great car wash."
7081,great view and alot of parking
7082,Just a joke prices are too high vegetables are rotten just not overall good experience
7083,Their knolegable staff is second to none
7084,"(Translated by Google) Mmmmmmmmmmm

(Original)
Mmmmmmmmmmm"
7085,What a great place to come and see some Wildlife prices are very cheap and there's plenty to see it's worth the trip.  $16.00 for adults.
7086,Great beer good food...kinda expensive...but great atmosphere!
7087,"The muldoon location is the best!!! They are consistent, friendly and make my order just about perfect every time!!"
7088,Everyone's loves Walmart lol
7089,For the barbecue man go there for the barbecue
7090,They replaced my Dana 80 axle. Customer service was outstanding. The repair was done quickly and communication was excellent. I highly recommend their business.
7091,McDonalds and taco bell across the street is perfect
7092,It was an awesome experience. Johnny the cashier was very kind and was very patient with my kids.  Great job Johnny
7093,"Quick and reliable service. Very knowledgeable and friendly! Good, honest pricing."
7094,Service was excellent.  Much better than my experience in the spring.  üòÄ
7095,I was very impressed with the whole experience with the auto repair shop. I called in the morning and I was told that I would be able to bring my jeep to the shop and the repair was done the same day.
7096,The drive thru needs widened for Alaskan trucks and the food is  slow to be made round lunchtime but they give you 2 different ways to back out if you're in a hurry and give up.
7097,"Great supplies,  hard to find someone to help you when you have a question.  Usually only 1 register open."
7098,I love the variety in the food and the beverages.
7099,Not very impressed... The parent company (Chepo's) is way better. Wait staff very rude. Food was more like a snack rather than a meal and my son's food came about the time the adults were done eating. Building looks great.
7100,My family has brought their pets to Hillside for about 10 or 12 years. Trustworthy and kind staff. Also one of few clinics for exotics. This clinic is important to me and my family
7101,the best Thai restaurant in town.
7102,"Lots of inventory in clothing, so I can usually find something that fits.  :)  groceries are not a good deal, check other grocery stores."
7103,Clean good price near the airport
7104,Customer service was bad.
7105,"Almost no indoor houseplants.

Beautiful outdoor plants!
Ordered 2 frozen drinks at the cafe, and they both didn't have enough ice. Yummy but they melted so quickly

I only came for indoor houseplants so unfortunately I will not come back again."
7106,"Couldn't find help with the binoculars, was ready to purchase...."
7107,Great restaurant who are keto friendly and more than happy to accommodate.  Delicious Mushroom Truffle burgers!
7108,"Very nice place to visit. The Walk on the Wildside tour was fun, very informative, and the tour guide was very knowledgeable."
7109,"The store is conveniently‚Äã located, the staff can find you what your looking for but sometimes seem a bit annoyed with you."
7110,‚òï Good mocha and breakfast burrito üåØ but the prices were high üíµ
7111,Very helpful and a fun knowledgeable staff...
7112,Nice hotel but no place to go on foot
7113,"Food was fast and great, service was good, and drinks were on par.  Pretty well ran establishment."

7115,Great for families or friends outings.  We had a awesome time!
7116,My favorite
7117,Great Curely Fries
7118,Always good food.
7119,"The staff is very limited having only one or two people on duty at a time, so wait times can get long, but they are friendly and helpful. The interior of the store also feels very cramped, but it looks like the layout is temporary, so overall 4 stars"
7120,Got my food and service was good
7121,"I have been drawing fresh water from this creek for over 30 years.

The area around the parking lot is getting trashed because neither State Parks not the visitors understand how to maintain trails.

Specifically, there needs to be education and community involvement in order to keep the trails maintained and prevent unnecessary devastation to the vegetation."
7122,I love coming here!!! They charge $3/person now but still worth it!
7123,"Everytime I go in here for something I think they'll have for sure, they don't! I wanted kimchi, nope. I wanted coconut vinegar, nope. They always have okra, tho which I can't get anywhere else."
7124,They do good work
7125,Really fresh food.  Everything tasted so fresh.
7126,Scenic spot in a lovely town.
7127,Consistently amazing sandwiches and great portion size
7128,Great homemade milkshakes

7130,"Clean, well run hotel."
7131,"(Translated by Google) Love saman Joanns ect

Love ihop Joanns ect"
7132,"These guys are rockstars! The only time I've ever been delayed was due to mechanical problems with one of the planes in Anchorage, so they were a plane down. As a former slope worker who now works at Red Dog Mine, I depend on their reliability to get me to Anchorage and they have never let me down.... Unlike their competition. Pretty sure they only hire stunt pilots because these guys have no fear and will fly through pretty much anything!"
7133,Grey Towers great service great personalities for their workers
7134,The manager cut my hair. She's great. . wish I could remember her name. Tall blonde hair. A real go getter!!
7135,great food and service
7136,"Best pho in town, probably better places overall but if your just after taste this is the place to go."
7137,"Part of our tour with Salmon Berry Tours included a lunch stop here, where we were offered a predefined menu. The food - especially the ‚ÄúFish ‚Äòn‚Äô chips‚Äù plate was waaaaay too oily. Didn‚Äôt enjoy much... Otherwise the place is charming and warm."
7138,Because it's McDonald's
7139,"tidy store , quick cashiers , plenty parking"
7140,Service fairly quick for a business lunch. I had the beef chili which was so good i am still aglow ;-)
7141,Grace pizza and other menu items and lots of beers on tap
7142,"I disliked my experience this time around. I brought my 2009 Ford Escape in for a front end knocking sound. My base care warranty was about to expire so my service adviser Jim said to get it in here before that happens. So after a couple of hours of inspection it was found that some motor mount bolts in the timing cover had come loose and subsequently sheared one off and that unfortunately this was not a covered repair. The end result was 370.00 for the repair and 30 something for the rental for the day. Upon getting my vehicle back,I look in my base care brochure and find that replacing the timing cover rather than repairing it is a covered repair.
My question is would it have been less involved to replace the timing cover than spend 3 hours drilling and tapping the old one and not have to have spent 400 something when it just may have been covered?"
7143,Great service.  Beautiful work for both manicures and pedicures.
7144,Employees quite helpful.  Had the items we wanted.  Decent prices
7145,Rented overnight for 11 year old sleepover birthday party - amazing time!

7147,Drove mom 50 miles for
7148,Superior customer service!
7149,"My family and I go to West pool almost every week, it's relatively cheap fun that's healthy and enjoyable for all ages. They have a water slide (for a small fee)  that you can ride unlimited that exits in really shallow water, they have a kiddy pool, a deep end , and a diving board in the real deep end. Lifeguards on duty at all time, and are generally great."
7150,"They have a great selection of items but the workers at the gun counter ignore you while they chat...often, and the elderly man at the gun counter has been rude frequently. All the checkers are really nice."
7151,Shop local
7152,"This store and staff completely embodies the most positive attributes and honest customer service that any service industry should strive to achieve. They are a family run business that are dedicated to thier craft and thier expertise in thier profession shines! You can tell immediately when you walk in that you are a valued customer and they really are interested in striving to satisfy. My personal experience is rated at a 5 star. They gave me an accurate quote and good price. The operators of the business, Dan, Mia, and Ryan, are absolutely wonderful people...I'll only take my devices to High Frequency Wireless in the future for repairs. Delivered A+++ service. Go here. I promise you will not regret it."
7153,Very good
7154,The service was excellent and the pizza was as awesome as always! The prices are average but they always have some special or another going on to save you money.  It was a warm and inviting atmosphere on this cold Alaskan evening.
7155,"Great price. We love the blizzard! Drive-thru times are horrendous :-( I'm currently sitting in the Drive-Thru.... it's been 13 minutes and counting. I hope our fries and food is still warm. Fries are lukewarm at best, and when we get home we figure out that all of our drinks which are Sprites have only carbonation and no syrup. Fries also were half full:("
7156,"It's Krispy Kreme, the best donuts anywhere"
7157,Great place for breakfast or lunch.
7158,"Coming from Southern California most of my life I'd just say it's another mall. It's modern enough but badly lacks restrooms on all levels, only has them on top most."
7159,This place is legit.
7160,Amazing dining experience. And so romantic
7161,Carrs has always been a delight. I always love night crews on northern lights and penland! Always making me feel comfortable.
7162,You can learn about the history and the landscape of Alaska.
7163,Lunch meat outdated by 2-weeks.
7164,"The Diner has incredible food, great and attentive staff, and reasonable prices! Plan to wait ~45minutes~ if you come around 10-11am but definitely worth the wait. Always opt-in for the home fries!"
7165,Good size market with a wide variety of offerings.  Got the biggest bag of delicious kettle corn ever for cheap!
7166,Just eat there yesterday.  Nice quiet place for lunch.  Was able to visit with family for as long as we liked.  The burger that I had was hand pressed and done just right!  I topped it off with a beer.  I will be going back for sure!

7184,Great Hospitality awesome food

7186,"Great local aquarium for the small town of Seward. They have a great mission of wildlife rehabilitation to the wild. The touch tanks are great for kids, and watching the sea otters, sea lions, and other animals is a blast! Great view of Resurrection Bay from the patio as well, and they do offer frequent discounts, in general and to Alaskan residents!"
7187,Obviously it's a national franchise so there isn't anything that stands out as unique for this location however the staff are always very friendly and the quality is on par with and decent Subway I have been to in the past.
7188,I wish another place has a play place.
7189,This was a fun tour. Shane Mary Lou and Gail did a fantastic job keep us entertained. The views at the stops were perfect!
7190,Just a nice place to shop.
7191,Very popular lunch spot adjacent to the Sea Life Rescue Center and with a great view of the bay. A great setting with quick table service of sandwiches and soups.

7193,There are a lot of great places in this Mall

7196,"They have amazing breakfast burritos! And so many options for flavors üòä my family and I enjoyed the food and the customer service provided, they were all very nice and answered all of our questions patiently"
7197,Service and food have steadily declined with the new ownership
7198,Altura experience is nothing but amazing. The atmosphere is relaxing yet classy. The service is impeccable and not overbearing. And the food is easily some of the best I've had in town. A must go to restaurant in town!
7199,"Downtown Anchorage is amazing! Good pizza, tons of great shopping nearby!"
7200,One of the best authentic Pho places in Anchorage. This is the Spenard Road location. Also have location on Boniface strip mall where That Wing Place is located.

7206,Quick service.
7207,"Favorite place in Alaska Juneau ,has it all what I needed,from socks to jacket ,from breakfast to the dinner ."
7208,"A great start to our trip. We learned a lot about the Inuit from the art and displays and they had a great 'science' area. We loved the historical exhibits as well. Its a part of Alaska that you don't get to hear about living on mainland America.
But when they say the close at 6pm then they really mean it. We were in the gift shop and suddenly all the lights were being turned out because 'they were closing'. I'm glad we weren't out in the main museum at that time!"
7209,Good store
7210,Great!
7211,There was a bunch of kids smoking and hanging about made me feel uncomfortable

7217,"Great food, good service and moderate prices."
7218,"Awesome location after finishing a couple runs at Aleyska.  Mediocre beer selection on tap.  Typical Alaskan pub fare, nothing too exciting about that.  Atmosphere though is incredible."
7219,Beautiful nuf said.
7220,Nice trip!
7221,Best chicken sandwich
7222,"It has lots of interesting decor, but also lots of commerical establishments. I loved the dinner show 6 years ago, but I did not get to it this time."
7223,"We went as part of a cruise package. For us having visited the marine centers in many cities we found it a bit underwhelming. It was pleasant enough, but took us about 10 minutes to see everything they had to offer. Guess it is a fine thing to do if you have some time to kill, but really enjoyed walking around the town and along the water more than the visit to the sea life center. Probably more fun for kids."
7224,Has a lap swim pool
7225,Food was ok. Worth trying but won't be back. Nothing special.
7226,"Really nice park, still has a fun and dangerous metal merry-go-round"
7227,"Actually pretty great, food was great, service was great!! We went way back when they first opened and never came back because we did not have the patience towait for the food. The food arrived quickly & hot... loved it!!"
7228,"Great staff, besides everything they have a knowledgeable crew who are friendly and try hard to get in what you need."
7229,Awesome friendly service and Awesome professional job especially with people with disabilities
7230,We had patty melt with spicy buffalo fries & fish basket with onion rings. Wished I'd saved room for a milk shake ... maybe next time.
7231,Nice place
7232,"Good d select and prices, especially considering the remote location. Staff is super helpful and friendly.
Good selection of knick-knacks as well as camping and sporting goods.
Stop here for Delta souvenirs."
7233,Amazing breakfast and such great service!!
7234,"Dr. Lloyd and his staff are AMAZING! They worked with me to create an affordable payment plan, and after just 3 short months, my years of back/neck pain are gone! Not to mention he was able to eliminate my seasonal allergy symptoms. Would definitely recommend these guys to anyone and everyone!"
7235,Really great gluten free baked goods section
7236,Great tasting food and good sized portions.
7237,Very Good
7238,"If you like fudge, this is the place for you!!!"
7239,Expensive but worth the price! Perfect for special occasions or just a tasty meal. Their prime rib is everything I wanted and more.
7240,"Ate lunch on a Sunday. In the years of coming to the movies, we never ate here, so we decided to give it a shot. First impressions were the booths were a little worn, and the menus had been waterlogged and were kind of stained. I ordered an Asian Chicken Wrap with a side salad, and a cup of coffee. Coffee was really good, so kudos there! The wrap wasn't bad, it just was kind of bland. Table salt helped, but it needed something. Salad was fresh, and the vinaigrette was nice. All in all, it was okay, and the prices reasonable with attentive service. Now, it is, by far, the best option in Dimond Center to eat and a great place to grab a cup of coffee. In the end though, the place didn't sing to me. But kudos for supporting local artists on the walls!"
7241,"We really loved this park. Separate fenced in areas for small and large dogs. Clean, well behaved animals, no creeps."
7242,Bessie is the best.
7243,Great tamales!!
7244,Great food and service
7245,Great place for burgers and ice cream!
7246,The staff are  very  good.  Prices are  high the owner will quote  you a  price then charge  you  higher what was quoted. Make sure  you  get  it in writing
7247,"The food is good, but the service it's really bad. We have a bad experience, I will never come back our server was so rude and racist, I was taking in Spanish with my girlfriend and he was so could after 5 minutes when they bring our food he put the bill in our table. He doesn't ask if you wanna dessert or no. Sorry for my English it's not perfect but I hope you can understand our bad experience."
7248,Expensive place but has things more tailored to Alaska (like bear bells to put on your dog's collar for hiking)
7249,"Great food, great location and amazing views."
7250,Brush me car off got right in and right out with  Beautiful clean car
7251,Excellent
7252,Excellent clothing store
7253,Delicious home-cooked breakfast for pennies! Limited hours.

7255,"Good place, no troubles."
7256,"Very good sports field, open and covered."
7257,Good service and honest
7258,"Stayed 2 nights. First night fine. Second night there was constant loud talking, slamming doors, pounding on walls,  sketchy people in stairwell.  Filth in elevator. Should have complained to manager, a comped night was in order."
7259,Good place to stay
7260,don't think about just go it's good
7261,Awesome food and great views.
7262,I've always loved going to the falls they are beautiful and a relatively easy hike.

7264,Great place to come visit
7265,Good Mexican
7266,Ok McDonald's.. Have had better
7267,Wonderful staff great prices. The best!
7268,Good food and good coffee
7269,Slushies great

7271,Bells Nursery is a great place for gifts and plants.
7272,"Usually busy, I love the pepper something burger, great food over all nice seating, food drinks and great service."
7273,"Food was average or sub par (I would not recommend the cauliflower tacos, very bland).
Our server was inattentive and forgot to bring us things."
7274,A fun place and history lesson every time you go.
7275,Great place. Fun atmosphere. Good music. Friendly dog. Axes. You can‚Äôt beat it.
7276,The lettuce has made me sick on three different occasions and the cashiers are having customers pull up to the highway to pick up there food.
7277,They botched our pizza order to hell and back but it was still pretty dang good. Dont order the calamari strips..... you get like...... a tiny handful worth of it.... for the amount they charge you kind of expect an actual appetizer amount. We were hungry and so cold being in the shipyard getting hauled so we still enjoyed the tiny bit we got and ths jacked pizza.
7278,Love the food
7279,Breathtaking
7280,Amazing
7281,My favorite campground in Cooper Landing.  A short walk down the hill takes you to the Russian River.  Camp spots are very nice and level for the most part.  This location will not disappoint.  A great deal of bears at this location so be bear aware at all times!!
7282,"What you can expect from Yellow cab, based on my experience with using them approximately weekly for 4.5 years:
- If you schedule a cab in advance, it will show up on time. They've never failed me in this, and this is what takes them from 1* to 2*. However...
- Despite directions for the dispatcher and in the ""additional info for the driver"" box on their app, only 1 driver - one! - in nearly 5 years has actually shown up at the right location. The driver typically yells at me about the inconvenient location and sits in the cab while I drag my heavy field boxes to wherever he is.
- About half the drivers complain to me about my short fare from Spenard to the airport, how long they have tip wait in line at the airport for a fare, etc. I know this and have always tipped well ($5 tip on a $10 fare), but they still complain. I need a cab, so have no choice but to put up with their grumbling.
- Expect to hear their political views whether you want to or not.
- Expect them to sit in the cab and allow you to load your own bags.
- Many of them are disrespectful to women.
- If you get a good driver, get his/her personal # and contact them directly if you can. Many will not give you their direct contact info BC they're required to operate through the dispatcher.
- When you're leaving from the airport, expect to have to drag your bags all the way to the FRONT of the cab line. The socialist system that requires you to use the next cab in line means that you cannot take the cab closest to you. Again, the drover will rarely help you take your bags to the front of the line. Most of them sit in the cab and let you do all the work. But don't forget to tip!
- Do not expect a service that even remotely resembles something that operates under a free-market economy."
7283,I love how cheap it is!!!! I can eat pizza slice for $1 and have beer.
7284,"Great food, generous portions, and fast service."
7285,Decent pizza if you like waiting forever.
7286,There was one worker so the pace was a little bit slow but the girl doing it was a champ for doing a line in a timely manner by herself.
7287,"Best King Crab I've ever had. The staff was great, the menu had everything we could want. The chowder was pretty good and my only complaint was the parking was very limited, but it was not too hard to plan around that."
7288,Has fish tanks and a touch tank and a model boat area Lots of them many different types of fish and a trail in the woods.
7289,Awesome
7290,"Friendly staff, super deals!"
7291,"Called the office to discuss a violation that was not for a vehicle I owned and the lady acted like I should know exactly what to do. I have never had an easy park parking ticket before and was calling to get clarity, but got attitude instead. I requested an email with procedures and violation number, but I never received it."
7292,"Pricey,  but excellent food."
7293,"Awesome food!, only eat there no where else."
7294,"Great supplies,  hard to find someone to help you when you have a question.  Usually only 1 register open."
7295,Love the fried special rice...
7296,"Yeah it's convenient, and it has larger machines... that's about it...

The standard load is $4.50 and the larger machine's start at $10... for a 23 minute wash...oh and get this, all the machines only take quarters, you read that right, half your time at this place is spent putting in quarters one at a time.

Extorting visitors is sad. Laundry in the far more remote town of Dawson, Yukon Territory was HALF as much."
7297,Social people cheap beer and a pool table
7298,Yummy sushi. Good customer service.
7299,My go to place for bads.
7300,"Whittier ,Alaska"
7301,Great
7302,Worst stake I have had at a restaurant. Extrememy overpriced for what we received.
7303,The Best Subaru Shop in town
7304,"Super fun. Lots of collectibles, mini figures, comics, and fun snacks and anime series from Japan."
7305,Good place to stay if you go up there
7306,Super friendly people that pointed me in the right direction on furniture!
7307,I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT PALMER

7309,"Nice memorial, we like to come visit the Eagles Notch & Jack and bring them fish when we can!"
7310,A nice roadside pull off viewing area.
7311,Pretty nice but a bit pricey for the amenities.
7312,This mall is alright! They have a gym and many other activities to help through the winter. Amazing flag out front. Check it out!
7313,Great Coffee
7314,Expensive but fun
7315,Great burger's and full beverage menu.
7316,Breakfast of course
7317,Yummy food and great service. Cute atmosphere.
7318,"Sa. any Dave n Busters, excellent bar and food selection + Games. The bartender service is prompt at lunch and dinner. Come check see it for yourself. 5 Stars."
7319,The only place I'll go to buy meat and produce from. They always have great sales going on
7320,"Long wait, but individual service is good. The menu doesn't indicate percentages of anything. The one thing I wanted, they were out of, so it must've been good."
7321,Was good. Our server was the best though
7322,Yummy
7323,Favorite place
7324,I ate here years ago but I am back to Alaska now because I purchased my lodge back. The service was great but the food was average. The quality of the meat was great but it was not seasoned well and it mad the steak pretty bland.
7325,Challenging parking but worth the visit. Great variety of camper shells and knowledgeable sales folk.
7326,Awesome food and customer service.
7327,"Best Mexican food, the mini chimmies are absolutely wonderful."
7328,Always good food.
7329,Great love the new sets
7330,Great music for worship and a great message
7331,Not bad has what u would need
7332,It's Taco Bell. Good price okay food.
7333,"I cannot complain. Getting over the fact that it is the dentist. I have had to go there twice for two different procedures. The dentist and the dentist assistant did amazing jobs to make sure that I was comfortable. After the local anesthetic started working the root canal was painless. The initial injections were painless as well. They were also good with working around our insurance, or lack of because we went over our limit, to make the procedure not place a drain in our out of pocket expenses."
7334,Great selection and friendly service.
7335,Good customer service.
7336,Excellent tie food and good doughnuts
7337,"Honestly the best place for froyo. and smoothies. Its vegan friendly and staff is very nice. The flavors change a lot. My personal favorite was cake batter and currently on the day this review was written is salted caramel thai tea that's vegan friendly. I'm not vegan but its soooooo good..
Update 3/26 THEY HAVE UBE FLAVOR GUYS"
7338,Clean quiet and the room's are very nice.. Beds are comfy and you have a choice of several different type of pillows.. The restaurant is close by and so is the Bar... Food is delicious and if you want to eat in your room They have take out.. A full menu and breakfast served all day..
7339,Best root beer in town.
7340,Amazing food and service every time. Many vegan and vegetarian options. This place is a winner ‚ô•Ô∏è
7341,"We were actually looking for another Italian restaurant we'd eaten at years ago, but couldn't find it. We ended up here instead!

We liked the quiet, relaxed atmosphere, and the service was perfectly paced to enjoy the meal. The four in our party all ordered different dishes and everyone liked their food. The dinner salad and bread were good but not amazing; the entrees were piping hot and tasty. We didn't have room for dessert...darn.  we would eat here again if in the area"
7342,I love me some hot bowl bibimbop!
7343,Ive got  15 tats and know how to take care of them and 5 times the tattoo guy not  an artist at all  dipped the needle in the wrong color ink  so I have red in the blue and the  blue in the red  DO NOT GET A TAT HERE
7344,Love it
7345,It was 10pm and there were many drunk people. Saw one passed out and one peed on the sidewalk.
7346,"Friendly staff, clean, modern, full portions, I'm not a huge fan of Mexican, so I didn't add much sauce ( they have several, serve yourself). It was not my cup of tea, but for those who enjoy Mexican food, I would give it a go."
7347,Nice scenery. We saw two moose's while going down the tram. Friendly staff.
7348,Awesome view. Great food.
7349,"Vince and his team have never let us down. They have a common sense approach and they won‚Äôt even give us a estimate if they think we are going to throw good money after bad. Their work is solid, never any problems after the fact. They try to get you your car back as quickly as possible too. They have been in business for a long time and are a USAA STARS business. If you are looking for straightforward answers, a friendly approach and good body work...Glacier will take care of you."
7350,Good food! The price is right. Halibut taco is great!
7351,Absolutely my favorite book store in town. They have a fast and friendly staff. Would recommend.
7352,Nice comfy place to drink coffee
7353,"Food is amazing! My first experience was very poor with the staff, and I was bothered by how confrontational the server was, however the food was better than most places in Anchorage so I have returned multiple times and simply accepted that the owners of the restaurant don‚Äôt value training on customer service in this particular location (compared to their other restaurants in town, and other restaurants in general), it‚Äôs not a part of their experience here and in general don‚Äôt expect smiles and quality service...if you know that going in, it‚Äôs no big deal and the food is absolutely worth it. I love their beet salad, I think it is the best salad in town!"
7354,"My sandwich could have been better, but the service was nice. I like the updated decor and food options. I was afraid the Udder Culture vibe would be lost with the new owners, but it's pretty much stayed the same. Except the milkshakes aren't the same."
7355,"Every time I've gone here they've screwed up my order. They somehow make their burritos watery and inedible. The service is touch and go. They have a few great people, and a lot of bad apples."
7356,"Good breakfast, massive pancakes"
7357,Great
7358,"Sitting by the creek, on a sunny day, yet in the shade while splitting an appetizer is perfect! They have food runners, and you aren't bugged to death by your server... However, you can flag down anyone and get anything you need... Water, silverware, more food, drinks, beer...  Whatever it is you like... Prices are moderate, so bring your cash (plus they take other forms of payment).  They are also part sports bar, part Alaskan casual restaurant."
7359,Always great food
7360,Best in Alaska period! Don't go there enough & never could!
7361,Salsa was good.
7362,Great selection of Ben and Jerry's. Also have a red box like DVD kiosk.
7363,Nice large portions. Fast dependable in store and delivery services. Reasonable prices.
7364,Difficult access
7365,"Really good organic selection I was really impressed, definately going back there, they had my favorite candy/honey and sesame bars, they even have one of the largest selection of organic spices I have ever seen, very fitting for the largest state!"
7366,"Great service, great food, beautiful and relaxing setting."
7367,"Smokey  hole in the wall where locals come to hang out. Television,  one pool table, pull tabs. Alaskan Cheese Steak co. Will bring your order over to you.

No more Cheese Steak co."
7368,Just wasn't what I was looking for
7369,"Yum. Yum.

We will return!"
7370,As always very professional and knowledgeable. Love the Abbot Freddys jewelry store!
7371,Great sandwiches if you like philly cheese steaks.  Good wings and great service.  Good portions that come with fries.  Cozy place with limited seating. I recommend the regular or boss philly for your first time.
7372,Oldest camp on the slope
7373,Helpful  employees and convenient location
7374,"Great place, like most other Red Robins."
7375,"Perfect fish and chips! We got the halibut and cod and both were great! Fresh local caught fish. Crispy, tender, moist and no grease. Extra coleslaw for me and malt vinegar made it even better."
7376,"They told us to wait an hour for them to see our dog, an hour turned into 2 hours sitting in the parking lot, and they still didn‚Äôt tell us how much longer it would be, they told us we were next but it could be another 30minutes to an hour, they wouldn‚Äôt let us leave to go get food or anything otherwise we lost our ‚Äúspot‚Äù. Our tire started going flat while sitting there and we asked them if we could run down to the gas station that‚Äôs right down the road, not even 5 minutes away, and they told us no and that if we wanted to go then we would have to drop our dog off to them inside while we left and they would medicate her. The people at the front desk were also extremely rude. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this business to anybody, especially telling us that we would have to have our dog medicated if we wanted them to see her."
7377,"Update: Dropping my rating to 4 stars because none of the staff is wearing a mask during this latest covid outbreak despite the request by state and city officials. You'd also get more than 15% tip from me on my to go order if you were a mask. Not sure what more incentive you need. (BTW, all customers picking up orders were wearing masks)

Great food and excellent service. Ordered Togo. Food was ready in 10 minutes. We got burgers, the Reuben, a steak sandwich, and mozzarella sticks. Everything was great and hearty. They have a small deck which would be good for covid times.  A bit pricey but worth it for everything we ordered, but probably could have saved money if we didn't get the mozzarella sticks.. Worth it!"
7378,Decent American-style Chinese food for somewhere in the middle of the Bering Sea/North Pacific. Big portions and prices were surprisingly comparable to Anchorage or Seattle.
7379,Always professional and easy to work with.  I love any business in Alaska that recognizes that we're not living in the 1970s anymore
7380,Super good sushi. Nice environment.
7381,Out of stock. All the time.
7382,Great coffee
7383,Great beer selection and a wide variety of food choices for whatever you're in the mood for. Staff is usually pretty quick and polite.
7384,No bathroom.
7385,Decent prices on packing stuff. Check out slooow
7386,"They are gentle and listen to the patient. I love this place and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Dr Han, Sarah, and Kira!!"
7387,My favorite bar in town!
7388,So many great trails in this park!
7389,"Used the pickup, fast and easy"
7390,2 and a half hour wait for delivery???  That's either poor planning or Super Bowl day. No today is not SBD.
7391,better when it was army/navy
7392,Healthy and good
7393,"Excellent food and service, great for lunch and dinner. Friendly staff try the shakes!"
7394,Always loved this place. Great food.
7395,"Moose is Loose is an absolute must anytime you're in the Soldotna area. Their donuts are absolute amazing, my kids and I love when we treat ourselves there!"
7396,Fun fun fun
7397,Great for fishing and letting rhe kids play at park!
7398,Great place to eat with friendly service
7399,Not bad
7400,"This is now a KOA.  Owners are great.  Cable, propane, and a free honey wagon for your tanks."
7401,"Fishermen's Bend is a card-lock gas station with no on-site staff. It has the lowest gasoline prices in Juneau. The station used to have a store as well, but that burned down in 2008."
7402,Great place
7403,They have have the best halibut for the best price in town
7404,"Great bread, grab their frequent buyers baker‚Äôs dozen card. The owners are always hard at work. However, if you have a question about a product or what‚Äôs in stock make sure to confirm the answer, the staff is often trying to give you the answer you want to hear, not what is actually the case.

Review as of 7 months later: a huge improvement since the new ownership!  All staff is super friendly and ready to help. The entire atmosphere of the restaurant has changed for the better, more relaxed and enjoyable.  Thank you for all your hard work!  It shows."
7405,Nice little boat launcher. Had a burger shack and a convenience and tackle store.
7406,Great place clean and safe
7407,"Good, short, little hike! Beautiful falls! It is steep in some areas but not to difficult of a hike!"
7408,"I went and got a summer milk shake with cheesecake, strawberries, and blueberries and it was so good. Dont try the sour patch one. Eeeewwwh"
7409,Great customer service.
7410,Prices. Values. Clearance aisle!
7411,"Been going here for years, and I have always received quality customer service. It the perfect place for your DIY projects and replacing small parts."
7412,Its got good prices but u gotta go with some extra time on ur hands cuz u gotta go through everything since its notborganized perfectly i assume cuz there is so much in stock and not enough space.
7413,Very interesting place to visit.
7414,Great service - very bad cooking! It changed recently. Before it was great in all areas. Not recommend!
7415,It's a comfortable place to have breakfast lunch or dinner it is a good atmosphere.
7416,Good food and half price appetizers after 9pm!
7417,"Food was good enough, not typically what i go for. My friend got food poisoning, so i took precautions once i heard.
The service seemed a bit oblivious, their menu was Americana at best. The food will make you gassy to the high heavens and back.

I don't eat this style often, closest i get is maybe taco night at home. Therefore, i asked the waitress, politely, as to what some things were and the differences between them. From what i gathered, there was little to no difference; some things had a bag of cheese from Costco on it, while some things were a bit more reserved.

It seems the health concerns of this place are still very real, but there were enough people inside when i went to warrant saying people either like it regardless or have not heard. 3/5 for my experience alone, 1/5 for being a hazard to public safety."
7418,Today after dinner I took my partner and father out to icecream. They were both served by a gentle man who gave them huge portions then the server switched and the new girl gave me about half as much. I think my frustration lays in the inconsistency of the sizes.
7419,"Great selection, super friendly staff, fair prices."
7420,Good restaurant just need to put a you menu on Google that way people could read it in order takeout
7421,Awes
7422,"Great price, good portions, I'm a fan of the less is more environment they've got."
7423,I LOVE this place! It's my first go-to any time I want to buy gifts or look for new art for our house. They have a little bit of everything and it's all unique and beautiful. I love being able to find most of my favorite Alaskan artists all in one place.
7424,Awesome service and price!
7425,Food was awesome!
7426,"If you're a Valley oldhead and you grew up going to the old theater, this place is a massive improvement.  Best theater outside of Anchorage."
7427,"A quick in and out and they had exactly what I needed.
Excellent check out, but the hard part is figuring out which fishing pole do I give my father-in law."
7428,Great local zoo to view bears and wolves.  The wolves always catch my eye and the exhibit is built nicely to view them pretty closely.
7429,"Awesome wildlife center!!! I'm not a fan of zoo's as most of them the animals seem sad; this is not a zoo. This is a wildlife conservation and rescue facility. Their work with wood bison has been groundbreaking.

The price is affordable, it's a small yet large facility. You can zip through in an hour or spend all day, it's entirely up to you. The interactions with the animals can be quite intimate as many times they are right up next to the fence.

If you're heading down the turn again arm this is a must stop! Whether you're a local or tourist this place delivers an excellent experience for the whole family."
7430,Good hamburger.. fast service clean table and a good hamburger with endless  fries.. milkshakes looked good also..
7431,Fantastic views in line with Alaskan scenery. Glacier tour worth the time!
7432,"I love this place! Fantastic selection of toys for all ages and of all types, finger puppets to STEM kits."
7433,Excellent service above and beyond care from my little guy.
7434,"The food is excellent, albeit expensive. Unlike most places, steaks do not come with sides. Don't let that cause you to stray, the food and entertainment here is definitely worth a stop."
7435,"Delicious food, always packed in season"
7436,"We rented the cabin, which had no running water, but it was beautiful! Had coffee machine, microwave, mini fridge and heat as well as a fan cause I get hot being from Alaska. The walk to the pool was short and refreshing but the outdoor hot spring pool was AMAZING! Everyone we encountered who works there were really nice and we plan to go back more frequently!"
7437,Kids had a great time
7438,"The food is simply amazing, the staff is always kind and the wait is usually short. Its definitely one of my favorite go to places for lunch."
7439,Great to help volunteers welcome
7440,Nice local theater with comfortable seats that were recently upgraded in late 2019.  Good prices on movies too.
7441,"Best burger place in town. You get sooooo much for the price. The place is small so indoor sitting is a tight pack but in the summer they have outdoor seating.
Their burgers are so juicy it doesnt feel like I can have a heart attack while eating. Their Phillies are tightly packed though and also good.
Basically anything you get at this place you will not be disappointed."
7442,Amazing food and atmosphere!
7443,"Country themed on one side, club themed on the other."
7444,"Good coffee and experience. I really like the design of the cafe and its retro feel. However, the chairs are not as inviting for long periods of stay and restrooms were dirty on my last visit. Overall nice place for a cup of coffee if your stay is somewhat short."
7445,Green apple Ice cream is my favorite there!!! üç¶my kids love rainbow though cuz it has a lot of flavors and colors üòâ
7446,Great Motel. Clean Nice Rooms. Will stay here again.
7447,"Chill hangout,  with a nice atmosphere. Excellent spot to get some work done."
7448,The land Jager is delish!
7449,Really like this place! Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Prices are fair. One of my new favorite places.
7450,Beautiful view of mountain peaks across the bay.
7451,Needs way more cashiers!!! Normally stand in line for at least 30 min to check out
7452,Ducks
7453,Love the selection !
7454,Good views good for tourist
7455,Wednesday night trivia is the best anywhere
7456,"Great beer, great staff and great meatloaf."
7457,"Still trying to like this place. Three visits and the food is ok, but not memorable. Atmosphere is ok, but a slight modification from the previous business.  The location is ham-stringed as proven by the previous restaurant failures here. I hope the new management finds the magic mix to success."
7458,Amazing food!!!
7459,This is a very well designed campground. Great outdoor experience.
7460,I just called the place of delivery and the lady who answered with a very nasty attitude asked me to place an order on GrubHub because it's too busy or something ridiculous I was going out on a limb to try this place out if you're looking for good service right off the bat I would miss this place.
7461,Love this place
7462,Like every other one its clean nice for kids good people and food
7463,Sells a variety of salmon based treats and snacks. Free samples! Canned also available. Prices seem reasonable.
7464,They got me in quick for a pedicure and did a great job.
7465,Convenient
7466,"Kids love to create their own pizzas! You can choose whatever you want to eat. We took family size thin crust, oil & garlic sauce, 1/2 spinach and cheese and pepperoni, 1/2 olives and cheese! Will bake our pizza at home!"
7467,"Stock up on your Alaska products here! Although it might be a bit off the normal beaten path for some folks, it is actually an easy place to get in and out of."
7468,"My first time in there. All in all, my needs were simple, just bought a case. Easy in and out. Nice enough folks."
7469,Best most accurate Chicago cuisine in town
7470,Was good worth the wait mostly
7471,Great food and service
7472,Cold but cool!üòú
7473,Good food problem is the fact that when u order comes out seems like they smash the burger
7474,"Great food, slow service probably due to how packed they usually are, also good location, no view, but the decor. makes for it."
7475,Shelves in low supply costumer service going down hill fast
7476,Amazing little cabins in a beautiful area with awesome food at the restaurant/Cafe. They will even pack you lunches if you're going into the park for a hike.
7477,This place is always a great time for all ages! 100% I.D. check on kids leaving the facility! Super safe for everyone.
7478,Everything you need at a great price!
7479,Pet friendly outdoor seating
7480,Great
7481,Favorite place in town
7482,Walmart app says free shipping when spending more than 35.00 ... but there is NO Free shipping to Alaska or Hawaii
7483,"Main hotel is decent, but the older sections are not!  If you stay here, make sure you have an inside room. The outside rooms are run down, and super hot! No air conditioner in the older rooms."
7484,Great customer service and products.
7485,best coffee around
7486,"Awesome food, awesome service, we really enjoy this place and highly recommend you eat here"
7487,I thought the service was top noch and the price was right.  Picked a Winchester for a great price.

7489,"Convenient, Starbucks. Great Macchiato'süòä"
7490,Fun! Excellent demonstration of lumberjack skills done in a fun way.
7491,It's simply disgusting.

7493,Always clean and shelves are full and neat
7494,Beautiful hotel food was fantastic and nice view of the city
7495,Love this park! Small but great! Nice central location!
7496,Good collection
7497,Excellent place for great Family fun wether you are watching or racing.
7498,"Big store for a handful of goods.  Does it really need a full wall display for three styles of panties? I'd have to say no.
That said I do like the clothing.  The quality is good and even the underwear I bought from the wall display are now some of my favorites."
7499,Big Ray's has a good selection of quality goods.  Their choices are different from all the other outfit stores.  Prices are very competitive.
7500,Only visited the bar for a meeting and had steak dinner that was delicious! Service was outstanding! Will definitely go again!
7501,Nice rooms and courtious staff.
7502,Fabulous adventures at the Kenai Fiords and Nelson is an informative and patient guide while kayaking.
7503,Had 840am appointment and wasn't seen until 903am
7504,This is my go to for quick hot food and good service
7505,"New Executive Chef is amazing, came out to say hi and made us an off the menu appetizer!  Food was awesome and Tara, our service, treated us like we were in a fine dinning restaurant. Prices were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend a stop at  the Silver Gulch to anyone!"
7506,A little shopping at safe way.
7507,I was taken care of today more than I expected.  Very happy with service from a PA.  Ty
7508,Nice clean store. Had everything I was looking for. The staff there was amazing!
7509,"I see something different every time I come here. Being so close to Anchorage, it is a must see for nature lovers and shutterbugs. The photos really do speak for themselves!"
7510,Good! Go eat there.
7511,Superfast food today!
7512,"Tasty wings, friendly folks!"
7513,Good food!
7514,"Would Not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Terrible customer service, the manager Leo showed no concern as to why my brand new truck is having numerous problems. He does do anything but make excuses. In my opinion he should not be in charge of tying his own shoes."
7515,"Top notch Thai food served by friendly people in a cute setting. Quick service, everything is homemade and amazing. The spring rolls were dynamite. I would definitely come again!"
7516,Nice store
7517,Wonderful staff
7518,Always our favorite when visiting Juneau
7519,"This is a great little grocery store. They almost always have what I need. They have lots of other stuff besides groceries, as well. The staff is always friendly and helpful. They accept credit cards, WIC and cash."
7520,One of the oldest and largest places of worship in the fairbanks area
7521,Good burgers
7522,Sooooooo slow
7523,"Fast friendly service with a smile. I forgot to get names but the lady there seemed very high stress and even said ""im not answering that again"" when the phone rang again. There was no reason for that."
7524,"I love that they are still open, yet keeping everyone safe, walked in on a Saturday night, only handful of people yet still felt a little bit of normalcy... only missing James being behind the bar singing!"
7525,Pricey but worth it for the food is perfectly cooked and delicious.
7526,Candy store for the fisherman.  Vicki here is excellent and very knowledgeable.
7527,Great local store
7528,"A cup of coffee and a slice of blueberry pie is always a winner. This day I had the Fish Tacos and it was good.  The chili is ok, but I think it has to much tomato paste and not enough beef.

The dinning area and bar are very relaxing. You'll spend a lot of time looking around here and taking pictures with the bears.

You'll find gas here too beyond the lodging and restaurant. Get a big cookie and say hi to the dog before you leave."
7529,"If you're in it to win prizes... Well, it's a good thing we weren't. My boys are under 3. They ran around non stop for an hour and a half. Even i had fun."
7530,Beautiful
7531,The service and food is very good.  The outside does not look so good but the inside looks terrifc. The decorating is first rate.
7532,"Absolutely loved the food, and the decorations"
7533,The halibut was cooked to perfection!! Homemade dressings are delicious!!
7534,Great place!  Staff very knowledgeable and friendly.  Plus they always have events going on!!
7535,Very good food. And pleasant staff!
7536,"The staff are very friendly, accommodating and professional. From the first visit, to the completion of services, Dr.Guy and his staff made me feel at ease. I now am very proud of my smile, along with the great job that was carried out with expertise by Midtown Dental Center. I would recommend their services to all. I will be back for any future dental needs!"
7537,Each please is not to  crowd so I like that
7538,Rare species in it's natural environment
7539,I loved the variety of expositions available.  Truly phenomenal work by the university to keep such diversity of knowledge.  We are now members and plan to return many times. In pandemic times they allow you to stay for 2 hours. It is not enough to see everything!! Wear masks please.
7540,The goat cheese salad is to die for!
7541,So good
7542,"I am not a huge fan of frozen yogurt. I did get a custard option, however it wasn't great. On the other hand, the toppings selection is without compare. So many choices for what to add to your sweet treat. Great place to take the kids!"
7543,"Granddaughters favorite park, hands down!"
7544,Best Costco in town in terms of selection. Not as busy (still busy) as the Dimond location.
7545,Nice atmosphere. Good drink menu.
7546,Tried to go there at a little after 8 pm there sas a line at the door and they were busy but told me that they are only doing to go orders and would not seat me. So i drove to Yak and Yeti down the road. Yak and Yetti was happy to seat me and had great service and food. Anchorage has choices for indian food and i will not come back to Namaste.
7547,Poker night in Wednesday is free and fun
7548,Great service. Steak was awesome. Loved it
7549,Food is good here
7550,"Decent price, good selection."
7551,"Amazing food. Smelled so good that I forgot to take pics of most of our dishes lol. Great attentive servers. We didn't have a reservation so they seated us in the lounge which was comfortable. We had the scallop mac and cheese, duck and ahi stack which were all good and cooked to perfection. The cocktails were well made, with a good amount of alchohol but a tiny bit slow coming out.
The chocolate bacon bomb was the perfect end to our meal. Delicious and decadent. Also flower less so great for anyone looking for gluten free dessert."
7552,To be honest I wanted to give 4.5 start I don't give 5 easy... but I looked back hard and I've never had an unpleasant experience here so... 5 it is. Highly recommend.
7553,Bourbon chicken and shrimp...all day! Great food!
7554,Great spicy bulgogi with delicious side dishes. Better prices and quality than other Korean joints in Los Anchorage.
7555,"Halibut fish and chips was soggy, kids chicken burger was chewy and the veggie patty in burger was the worst ever. The soy patty looked like a minced meat patty. The service wasn‚Äôt any good either. They brought the veggie burger with meat patty which they exchanged promptly without much apology. The wine didnt arrive until I reminded them midway through the dinner. Never refilled the water. Can‚Äôt think of worse service. The ambiance looked good."
7556,"Very nice resteraunt on the water, great food, of course the fish is fresh and the service is great with a smile. You can even meet some locals there which is a bonus, we got to here some boat captains talking shop. One of the captains was from Alaska 4 Star Charters he answered all my questions I had about his business."
7557,"I use this Car Wash for all my vehicles and their washing needs...I love it and will recommend the self wash more than anything...it's a preference of mine though!! Yours can be different...either way, it's awesome!!"
7558,Amazing food.  Good service.  Great atmosphere.
7559,Always great cheeseburgers...
7560,Place to have a quick lunch
7561,Always good
7562,Food sucks
7563,Good bread
7564,"Great food, awesome coffee, good people"
7565,Always fast and friendly!
7566,Knowledge and variety
7567,Grabbed breakfast before getting on the train to Denali. Good food but just as expensive as what we found at the railway station. It would be a good place to eat no matter where you are headed.
7568,"Nice store, usually well stocked"
7569,"Alice's was one of the first bars in Homer to go smoke free, and I've been a reliable customer there ever since. They have plenty of craft Brews on tap, good service, friendly bartenders. I enjoy watching games here and the trivia night is a lot of fun.They've dabbled in food throughout the years and it's usually been very good. The hamburgers on locals night are a great deal and delicious. If there's one thing that Alice's could fix, it would be the servers who work the floor. Most are good but some don't bother to learn the food or beer menu, so they're useless for recommendation.At least that's been my experience. In fact we had a server tell us that the soup was something that was completely different than it was because she never heard of borscht before and didn't bother to learn what it was. Hello, Google?"
7570,Great place with good portions.
7571,Super unique ice cream right Downtown Anchorage. I had the Fireweed. I also sampled the Birch syrup ice cream. My son got spruce tip!
7572,Lovely accommodation and friendly customer care..
7573,Just have too come by and see for yourself greit's great.
7574,"Been MA-10yrs big ""faafetai"" (thank you) to charter college. Looking to expand my healthcare career through your nursing program & would love to hear any feedbacks about it."
7575,"It was all right. It may be good for people that are visiting here. The person I I was with me with the only customers there until the very end of our meal. Even though the restaurant was empty I said was very slow bring out items and getting back to us with questions, etc.

although, I've had friends and people I've dated that have been serviced and they have always said that the busiest times are the best for service and get your food quickly... Seems like it would be opposite but apparently when the wait staff isn't kept busy, it's easier to lollygag and put off table service.

about this restaurant is specifically... Our server was very nice and friendly... The environment's kind of nice,  somew modern... It's a little dark for my standards at the tables but I like things very well lit sobek can't really be evenly applied to all people"
7576,"The service was bad, had to wait a good 15 minutes to be seated. There was not that many people there. The food was bad. The bacon was not even cooked all the way it was just as if they throw it in oil and taken out. Our eggs was supposed to be scrambled they were like eating rubber. The hash browns were not even fully cooked. My daughter chicken nuggets were cold and tasted old the corn was cold.. This was the worst service and food me and my family have ever had. Don't waste your time. They sure don't care..."
7577,Veteran Friendly and Excellent Customer service
7578,Great recreational park. Definitely come here if you are looking to have some fun!
7579,"If anyone rates this restaurant bellow 5 stars they are lying through their teeth. Not cheap, be prepared to drop a pretty penny. However the entrees present some of the best flavor combinations and presentations in the City. Do not pass this place up."
7580,"If they dont have it, they will do their best to get it for ya"
7581,"The folks at Diversified are knowledgeable and friendly. If you have any question about the best tire for your application, they will point you in the right direction. Plus, I don't know of another shop that gives as much back to the community as Diversified Tire."
7582,Kinda slow but food was ok
7583,It is some good food there
7584,Used to come here often but for fast food the wait is horrible .. Cistomer service is not impressive .
7585,I got to yell bingo! It's about time. Love this place
7586,Food is good for the price.   People are friendly.
7587,Everything is overpriced. Way overpriced.
7588,Excellent customer service.
7589,This place is one of a kind. The Santa Claus house in North Pole. Not to be confused with The North Pole. Get your letters post marked as showing North Pole. Lively place and lots of decorations. Coffee shop and  reindeers.
7590,"New girl screwed the order up, she didn't know the menu contents well, and when I asked if the ""Smokin Hot Chipotle"" came with sides; she told me what the burger contents were.
Recieved the food, the sweet potato fries were burnt. The jalepinos were cold and the service was slow on a 3pm saturday.
She then went outside to smoke, returned and went  the counter to remove her jacket and went back to the register. My opinion, I am sure there is a company policy about ""all employees must wash their hands"" before returning to the counter.
Disappointed."
7591,Love Rachel. Amazing waitress and extremely customer friendly. Great experience every time we are here
7592,The people
7593,Seems to be a good place
7594,I look forward to state fair to me its an opportunity to spend time with my loving Family . Its all about Love & Family having a good time.
7595,They are very helpful no matter time of the day.
7596,Good times only gone for the bands
7597,"Good food, thank you.  River did a really good job."
7598,Love our little Plaza still enough to do for an afternoon
7599,Good Quiet Atmospher
7600,F#@$ing closed on Mondays.  I suppose i should have checked that out rather than spend $12 on parking across the road. There's a lot of vagrants out front. Don't let them deter you. Even if it is freaking Monday.   Stupid Monday
7601,Fast and friendly! Great place to get military haircuts and more. Right outside Badger gate. Very convenient to post and affordable! Best deal in town!
7602,"Very SLOW - if there's any kind of line, I recommend you go elsewhere"
7603,The food was amazing but the service was lacking
7604,Food was fantastic. Cute setting. Prices reasonable.
7605,"Great place for a date as well as many unique items as gifts you cannot usually find in stores. For that special someone, there are many choices to choose from."
7606,Eating lunch with Richard at Kenai Airport...
7607,An awesome spot to relax.
7608,Love the food here. The service on refills can be spotty at times but they are quick on each they know.
7609,They don't really carry what average people need
7610,One of my favorite places in town. Always on point food and service at a fair price. I recommend the pork vindaloo and their macaroons are wonderful for a sweet treat to split with a friend.
7611,Such a beautiful place
7612,Okay food but too expensive.
7613,"It says horn and antlers on the sign and they definately have a good selection of those, but where this place really shines is in its minerals. There are many rocks from around alaska here for sale so if you are a rockhound make sure to stop by! It also has a very cute gift shop to the left that his wife runs. All in all 8/10 could have had more rocks :)"
7614,It was excellent great food and awesome severus
7615,Great candy
7616,It's a great place to play games and have fun like a adult playground but you can enjoy the moments with your kids as well food isn't that great but as far as the arcade A++
7617,"Yep lots of stuff, friendly staff pet friendly. Clean. Cool place."
7618,Exceeded expectations.  Courteous phone/in person service for late night emergency tire repair & FAST!!!
7619,"This was interesting... A meth head yelling in the street for two hours at 1 am, mice in the walls...no working outlets, 15 channels, interesting bathrooms but mainly bad customer service. Definitely an old hotel that seems cool but you won't sleep here."
7620,Lousy food.  Wouldn't waste my money. Go somewhere else .
7621,Clean well managed grocery store. That is clean and well staffed with pleasant employees
7622,Always clean and stocked. High quality machines. Fair pricing.
7623,"Great Holiday, poor neighborhood. There's always at least one person that's going to try and get some money from you outside as you're walking in. More then once has there been intoxicated homeless people screaming at everyone in the parking lot as well. Defiently lock your car. Moving on to the Holiday itself, it's quite clean, service is great, and the rewards program is awesome. There are a wide selection of items and they're all priced far lower then the Chevron and Tesoro down the street. Only complain I have about the store is that the fountain machine flavor shots are almost always having issues. Rarely do they shoot out the right flavor, if anything at all. It's a good gas station, just a bad neighborhood."
7624,"If you can find a seat, this is hands down the best food in Anchorage. I have eaten at the very best restaurants in town and they all pale in comparison. Do yourself a favor and get the special, it is always the best thing on the menu."
7625,This tiny shop had just the part I needed to fix a gas fireplace a week before we sold our condo and none of the other gas stove suppliers in town had what I needed.
7626,Overpriced
7627,"Good food, minor error in the order, but our tummies were happy in the end."
7628,Very Impressed with the exhibits!
7629,"Fun place, awesome pool tables and other games.  Friendly, helpful employees.  My son is already begging to go back !!!  Plus FREE popcorn!!!"
7630,Maria was very  happy  and so was I!!!

7635,Nice little place downtown with a great selection of everything. Prices very reasonable. Nice variety of winter shirts and hats. All kinds of t shirts.
7636,"Consistently the best large store on the Peninsula. Make sure to shop the sales, otherwise Costa can be a fair bit higher than other local stores. If it isn't on sale this week, don't worry, it will be next."
7637,"Great food, good service,  overlooking Denali"
7638,Seriously unique Pizza incredible tasting an experience worthwhile
7639,OK so this place through owners has been different but always great..my place  to go in Wasilla for sushi..I recommend sitting at the bar and talking to the sushi chefs
7640,Great Bonsai hour!
7641,A must do destination.
7642,"This hotel is a bit old and rundown. It could use a renovation. Low prices and clean, but this was a saturday and lots of partygoers. Why no breakfast on sundays?"
7643,Everything was great. The food and service were great. Loved the open kitchen and seeing the whole process.
7644,Made us feel awkward. Didn't feel welcome.
7645,"It's called a convenience store.
Not a courtesy store or a conversation store, so why would you expect any interaction  when making a purchase to be anything more than perfunctory?
It seems otherworldly that every time I stop in there, whichever  clerk on duty greets me as though they have a vested interest in my well-being. It's reminiscent of Giuseppe at the corner market.
Way to go team. Please keep treating people like people."
7646,Not a lot of choices
7647,Delicious
7648,"Haha! This is NOT the best course in AK, not at all. The views are great and conditions on the front are good but the back 9 is a nightmare. The back 9 is really really bad (conditions, layout, etc.) If you play here just go around twice on the front 9 and you'll enjoy yourself much more."
7649,They had the part I needed  when  no one else did. I don't give out 5 stars
7650,They were friendly and the food was great.
7651,"Food came out fresh, fast, and delicious! 10/10 will be frequenting Blue Roof Bistro!"
7652,Fun ride. Crab feast was great too.
7653,"The girls were all super at getting us caffinated before the fair.  Breakfast burritos were very filling and delicious.
Thank you Katie and team for getting us moving and keeping us going during the season.
Awesome job."
7654,Creative and delicious sushi. My favorite sushi in Anchorage.

7659,"Helpful staff, however pool was closed due to COVID-19"
7660,"Service was great, food was delicious, restaurant was clean! No complaints!"
7661,When one Macdonalds closes another one is open.. All American
7662,"Don't let the outside fool you, by this I mean I turned in the wrong parking lot and thought I was at an apartment. I really enjoyed it and it wasn't all mechanical like other escape rooms. Rooms has their proper interiors for the situation. There is a guide in the room that will give you hints but not answers which made the experience more pleasurable when we hit a brick in the wall. I really suggest you go with friends but from other rooms it seems like you could come in and get paired with other people."
7663,"Best baked goods ever, love this place!"
7664,"Love the variety here, and impressed with the expansion of the pet area."
7665,Love  $0.12 cones
7666,Crowded

7669,Lower the prices.
7670,Nice spot for walking
7671,Friendly customer service
7672,"A blend of authentic, signature and original flavor. The serrano salsa is great, just wish they werent so skimpy with some of their ingredients. Great local beer selection."
7673,Friendly greeters at the drive through window
7674,Beautiful view and very clean
7675,Good prices and good deals but the dude could be nicer and he needs to clean his store.
7676,I had the best Mexican food I have had in a long time!! The price was really good!! I will be back again!! I will also tell everyone I know about this place!! Really great place to eat!!
7677,Fine.
7678,"Great time.   Great Food
The owner is great at telling stories and the history if the area.   If you are on vacation, I recommend that you eat here and learn a little"
7679,Always have what i need üòÅ
7680,Third time in a row i come here to the drive through and they have me wait on the side of the building. Needs new management.
7681,Wonderful experience! Love eating here
7682,Great food with really nice service!
7683,Must go
7684,I love the prime rib it's the best! Very good prices and healthy options for kids meals. You will be able to see the Sleeping lady mountain and the Alaskan train going by the restaurant!
7685,"Store hours posted on door and web page state that the store would be open until 8:30PM, I arrived at the store at 8:15PM only to find it locked up and empty."
7686,Not bad clean ordered allot and they got it all perfect
7687,"Chicken tortilla soup is spot on, I could eat it every day. Chicken chimichanga rocked, kids loved the street tacos, wife loved carne combo..Halibut street taco was moist, perfectly cooked.."
7688,"My favorite is the 10"" Cheesesteak Sandwich. Homemade bread made daily ~delicious food!! Also love the historic building, two floors, plus outdoor seating available when weather permits. Adequate parking just across the street."
7689,Much required break after a long journey
7690,"Good selection for the Fairbanks area, decent prices, and nice staff."
7691,Great place for subs üòÅ
7692,Awesome
7693,"Service was mediocre, but the food and drinks are good"
7694,Excellent range facility!!!
7695,Decent burger good other choices if you wanted.
7696,"Very good, food was excellent cooked very well and exactly as ordered. Waitress was great and friendly, stayed on top of everything!"
7697,Clearance
7698,OMGosh. I can't come to Girdwood without visiting the Muskey.  Their food is AWESOME!  Local family has owned it.  The food is always the same.   SPECTACULAR!  Don't miss it!
7699,"Amazing hiking experience on glacier. However, our guide  did not explain much. We had two guides, one lead the group (and was suppose to explain) and the other one was behind the group. The one leading the group was fast paced and she did not really keep the whole group together. Basically the faster folks were with her and the slower ones were with the other guide.
If you‚Äôre a confident hiker, this guided tour doesn‚Äôt add any value, since they don‚Äôt explain much.
Since, we were novice hikers, we wanted to take the guided tour, more so because there are no marked trails. On hindsight I wish we would have checked out nova, dr Sarah or other options, wherein the guide would explain more about the glaciers!!"
7700,Amazing food drinks service and view
7701,Had some great pieces and we found something that checked all the boxes in our price range
7702,"Nice place, but I thought the price for the halibut was high.  Also had the clam chowder.  Good amount in the bread bowl, but it tasted like it was out of a can with a ton of green seasoning.  There were 4 of us eating and no one was overly satisfied."
7703,"Service was just ok, but they were busy. Seems prices have crept up, too."
7704,Not really sure
7705,The food was great and the staff very friendly and helpful.   I celebrated my birthday wonderfully.   Thank you!
7706,Very enjoyable for both adults & kids and they make kids safety a priority
7707,Great service. Beautiful dining room and wonderful views. Menu is always changing and may not be what is on the website.
7708,"I took a very large mix of copper, brass and aluminum to be recycled. The yard manager was extremely helpful and taught me a lot of tips for the next time I bring in a load. I.E. remove handles from boiler drains, make sure brass and steel are taken off of copper it's soldered onto, etc. I gained a lot of knowledge from this trip. The office staff were kind and helpful as well. Their prices were fair and competitive. I will absolutely return here again and I highly recommend them if you are looking for commerical recycling."
7709,Great place to work and exercise at the Dimond location
7710,"Clean, quite, and relaxing atmosphere. Was greeted, promptly seated, and served. The price isn't to high and the food was delicious.

Great place to meet up, have a bite, and chat with a friend."
7711,Food is horrible. Got charged for food we didn't eat. Server Alexis B was rude and inattentive. Took our card from the table and charged it without telling us our total because she knew she was charging us for something we asked her to take off
7712,Terrible service today. .. had to remake my coffee three times. Forgot napkins for my lemon loaf.... just was an off-day for this location
7713,"Easily 5 Star service and coffee.  But for $6/cup.  The lot should be paved.
'Do you want a lid'.........uh,  yeah..for when I drive through the giant potholes 3 ft from here....hahaha."
7714,They overcharged for their products but they let you rent them so you won't have them so that's nice
7715,Amazing food and the staff was great and friendly
7716,Beautiful place to walk around the old mine town
7717,Covid!
7718,Great place for BBQ! Friendly staff and delicious food. I'll be back.
7719,"Long lines, but great staff and reasonable prices. Avoid lunch and after work for faster service."
7720,It was okay I guess it wasnt that good and to be honest I wouldn't reccomend it.
7721,Vape Lovers Den! You'll find what you need and what you want.
7722,Great place with good food
7723,Staff was very helpful.  Nice and clean free parking.
7724,Ok place wouldn't leave home for it.
7725,Seriously amazing!!!
7726,Great park!
7727,Family time
7728,Gets the job done without costing a fortune
7729,Was the worse experience I have ever had. You had to pay to get in just to pay to do anything inside of it. Made no sense to me to waste money to go into a place that I had to pay more once I was in. It was so small also. Was able to walk it in 5 minutes and leave. Lost money just to go for a walk.
7730,Great place
7731,"If I could describe the employees here: unapologetic, stupid, and rude.  I call up and ask for a product before driving across town, they assure me they have it, exactly what I ask for, multiple times.  Great, I think, I'll just slide on over and pick it up then.  After arriving I go in and do not find what I'm looking for, so I ask for help.  Instead of showing me he just says ""we might have it, it will be in that area"".  Dude.  So I go check again, nothing.  I ask about the specific product I spoke about over the phone, and of course they don't have it.  Oh well, I generally avoid GameStop to begin with, my first attempt at patronizing the store in probably 6 or 7 years is a terrible experience.  I'll be sticking with Amazon, at least when they say they have a product, they actually have it.  Their customer service is also light years ahead."
7732,"Good, except they shut down right when we got their 8:¬≥0"
7733,"A great place for many activities from shopping, to exploring the several museum's, different varieties of art in music to culture to contemporary, and a playground for the kids.  In addition, every night at 7 they feature a music performances.  The Pioneer Park also has many  food vendors and a lot of different places to have a picnic or a BBQ or your organization or business can book a pavilion for summer picnic parties.  They have an optional RV parking as well.  So, much more to name, definitely a great place for the family and visitors.  I would definitely recommend coming here."
7734,What can i say great coffee fast service.
7735,"The food was great! It was late, but they were still busy, and there was only 1 waiter, but he did a great job despite forgetting a couple of things."
7736,"I just bought a yard car and was having some noticeable transmission problems and took it down to these guys after taking a look on the Google ratings, I have to say these guys are absolutely professional and have tons of integrity. Rick in particular was very helpful and even took some time out to answer some questions I had. If you are having some transmission problems, please don't hesitate to give them your business, if you're looking for a trustworthy mechanic! These are going to be my transmission guys in the future."
7737,An excellent full service hotel convenient to all downtown features. The rooms are spacious and well maintained. The associates friendly and helpful. Overall a comfortable home away from home.
7738,Great stock and honest people
7739,They had the food we needed when no one else in town did.
7740,Size of food is good. It is delicious.
7741,"Variety of food choices, open air market style and colonial stage performances"
7742,"Good clinic, google Dr.'s"
7743,"What a great concept! There is something amazing about grabbing an axe and chucking it into a block of wood that just feels so RIGHT!

It's much easier than folks think‚Äî I have been twice, now, with at least three people that expressed trepidation at their ability to throw an axe with any kind of safety or effectiveness. The staff is top notch, safety is briefed extensively prior to each visit, and they had people that had never thrown a sports-type ball in earnest sticking axes into wood within 20 minutes!

The food and beverage selection is somewhat limited, though you can purchase Monster brand energy drinks and all sorts of company branded products, such as T-shirts and hats, as well as your own axe! Hoodies are in work at the time of this writing (9/14/2020)"
7744,"The beer utterly fantastic with a number of unique brews you can't get anywhere else in Anchorage. Try the house beer for something really unique. Unfortunately they only serve beer five hours a day. The food was tasty, with good portions and blending of flavors. The ambience was okay, half the cafe has a really unique setting, though seating is prioritized in the more normal section. The bad though was the service. It was just slow, and felt really undermanned for Sunday brunch. It almost feels like the hostess wasn't happy to see us. Infrequent waiter visits and long time for food to come out."
7745,Great pad thai.
7746,Such amazing views and scenery! Lovely cabins and great staff! One of the most peaceful areas ever.
7747,The Super Nachos w/ ground beef are Da Bomb!!!
7748,My
7749,Great selection and value.
7750,We stayed here because we needed housing while my husband was getting surgery and ANMC put us up at this hotel.  It smelled like people were smoking inside the building.  At first they put us in a room that was full of trash and obviously had not been cleaned yet.  The whole place was dirty and I was nervous we were going to get robbed.
7751,Decent food and service. Good drinks
7752,"Food is cold, don't get crepes they just plop it on plate and try to cover the burnt spots with sauce and whip cream!"
7753,"I met some friends here who wanted to bring their kids to this place. Half the games are what you‚Äôd expect, the other half are just mediocre. You swipe your game pass and push a button to see a ball fall in a hole for 2 tickets. No real entertainment in that. The kids were bored fast, which is unusual considering how they like to play games. Food was ok at best. Reminded me of carnival food. Several people working on game machines while little kids are running around them.  Doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea to me. Not impressed with the facility at all. No cleaning underneath anything. I would never take any children there."
7754,Great service! Thanks grind family!
7755,Always a great time @Cabelas
7756,Great deal for wholesale.
7757,Prompt and good service

7761,Great vistas both north and mountains along with Cook Inlet.
7762,Favorite coffee shop in Juneau. Very inclusive and inviting. Best food in downtown
7763,"Enjoyed my time here with some friends! Our server, (Jonathan I think) was very gracious with our large group. The mozzarella sticks were my favorite!"
7764,Great place to shop and lots to choose from. And staff is fantastic.üôå
7765,Not sure what meat is used here...?
7766,Store owner was very helpful and knowledgeable. Helpful on showing me what bow was right based on my eye sight 10/10 would recommend
7767,Excellent food and atmosphere! I'll definitely add this to my list of favorites.
7768,They're a great company for only in Alaska
7769,Fun place
7770,Very helpful!
7771,I feel if you run out of hamburger buns you should just close your store down poor customer service tonight 03/10/2020
7772,They have pretty good selection of Games with pretty good deals.
7773,"New Sagaya has always been a go to place for me. From the hard to find Asian ingredients, to the excellent produce, and the freshest seafood around, New Sagaya will always be on my shopping list."
7774,"Ok job on brows, but felt a bit unfinished. Seemed uninterested in answering my questions related to my service and up-keep."
7775,Good place to drink a beer
7776,Great food and service!  Great portions of wonderful food.
7777,Awesome view but tends to get crowded.
7778,Beautiful
7779,Why would i go here?? I live in Eagle River
7780,"Switched to this place last year after receiving sub-par service at another place. They were closer to the house so we picked them to try. We are both very happy with out choice and as you can see returned as a happy customer. Everything from being greeted, checked in, exam and selecting glasses was perfect. Dr. Brian Cin is great with the exam and takes the time to discuss everything with you.  Plus he is a veteran so makes it even better knowing that. The staff was different this time than last year and they were exactly the same so I know it's a culture thing wanting to provide excellent customer service. If your shopping for a new place to get the eyes checked out you won't regret coming here."
7781,Fast and friendly service and very clean!
7782,The service was great and food was fantastic. Been wanting to try this place out for a while.
7783,Nice gals
7784,"Good food, good price, short wait time, clean restaurant, very friendly staff"

7786,"comfortable, warm service and relax"
7787,"Eugene was an excellent waiter. Food was delicious and brought out quickly. And our waiter, Eugene was very nice."
7788,Got a chicken parm sandwich today that tasted like Drano - had to throw the whole thing away
7789,"Super friendly, delicious and so much food! They have a challenge meal too, gigantic Chicago style sub. Everything on the menu is phenomenal!"
7790,"Great Fred Meyers! The store is clean and layout is nice, selection is pretty good. Some items are certainly more expensive than in Anchorage, but I assume that's to be expected."
7791,Brown Jug have anything you need to drink
7792,Very old hotel but well maintained.
7793,"Cheaper glacier cruise compared to Seward, and bigger/better glacier too. Friendly staff, delicious chowder for lunch. Captain gives a great tour and went over and beyond by providing extra tour of wildlife after viewing  Columbia Glacier. Highly recommend over Seward options."
7794,"(Translated by Google) Incredible place. With tours to see bears and whales.

Lugar incr√≠vel. Com passeios para ver ursos e baleias."

7803,Great place to eat
7804,"Best dining experience there in a few visits, but first time there this early. Food was hot n fresh but my FAVORITE on their line was under cooked. Their Southern Fried Chix was under cooked, but they took care of it! Mmmm first brunch there in almost 4yrs"
7805,Best sushi restaurant in Anchorage/Eagle River. Great staff and great cost restaurant with TVs for the games.
7806,"I'm sure this place is awesome if you're a bit imparred... I wasn't

7807,"Friendly staff, fluffy pancakes and timely service"
7808,Cheep has everything
7809,The check in ap. is very confusing.  I asked about it & they said it's confusing & offered no help.  Didn't have a long wait.  Got the haircut I wanted. Pricing is a bit high for a haircut.
7810,a little noisy and a bit pricey but the burgers and brick oven pizza are awesome! so is the service! a great beer selection too!
7811,Staffs there are rude.

7827,Love that they carry Alaska Grown
7828,Clean Machine!
7829,Beautiful lake! I ride up to the lake can be a little scary but it is well worth the drive from Independence mine state park! Only a short 3 min drive!

7835,Depends on who is working. Some staff is not very knowledgeable
7836,Food was awesome! Service was pretty good. Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants in Alaska that I've ever been to!
7837,"Ordered  2 to go pizzas by phone. Used the online menu to place the order. Online menu is easy to navigate and pictures are accurate.
Staff was professional and easy to understand. Meaning she spoke clearly and didnt mumble. 30 min wait, and staff was waiting inside to direct patrons to their ""station"" to pick up order. None to very little contact. Very impressed with how organized and proficient my short visit wS. Thank you Mosses Tooth  & staff for a job well done!!
Oh and our pizzas are delicious!! üòÅ"
7838,"selecting my furniture from this furniture store was nightmare!! from a very aggressive defensive regional store manager Keith, to defective damaged new furniture, being told if i returned it, i would be charged a 25% restocking fee for damaged furniture! , after a long heated discussion in person I was able to select a new couch with salesman Julian. couch that was delivered wasnt the 1 I selected! so, this would be visit 3 in person to speak with Joy another sales representative who assisted me with yet getting this taken care of. so, as this point 3 times a charm right?? now at this point I still don't have my new furniture and now the accounting shows I owe more than what I actually owe.. was told I was given a refund from Nick the store manager etc. so now this is the 4th time going down to Bailey bringing all receipts showing monies applied. so at this point speaking with Keith the regional manager again were he's very defensive putting blame on me the customer since I had to change out my furniture due to"" damaged and wrong furniture "" comparing the mistakes made to my profession which is in the medical field which if mistakes were made I wouldn't have a job. so, when furniture was delivered the 3rd time 1 piece wasn't delivered and was told it wasn't on the purchase order, so now phone call #5 speaking with Miracle and told she didn't see the item I purchased lol what the hell! so, at this point she had to call up front to speak with Leianai to confirm yet another mistake on Baileys part! how is this company voted best furniture store for 13 years? and be told by the regional manager i could just get a refund and take my business elsewhere in our previous conversation which was overheard my Miracle, Julian in the back office??? hmm great customer service Bailey's. all this stress and headache to be given a $1.99 shopping bag with Buddy face on it. what a joke.  I hope the owner reads this complaint, beacuse there more to the story"
7839,Food was typical subway although the variety of vegetables was limited. There was an extreme language barrier that made communicating with the staff difficult. Sandwiches were sloppily constructed.  Will probably avoid in the future.
7840,"Good prices, competitive fuel prices (lower than even Costco) Great Customer service. Their old way of car wash, not laser is preferred."
7841,Great food.
7842,For people love asean go that store everything you need
7843,"Have been there several times when the owners / staff seemed to not want us to come in because it was half an hour before closing. They would cook for us but it would be to go...? We left!  Weird. The two times I ate there they didn't understand 'Not Spicy,' and I ended up with food inedible for me!"
7844,"Excellent food and great view of the airport. Staff was friendly and food came out quick even though it was busy. You won regret giving them a try, they also have a decent beer selection on tap. Pizza is a hand tossed thinner crust style with a large variety of toppings."
7845,"They have all kinds of stuff, but BULK stuff"
7846,We love this area. In the summer we walk the dog and our child on the countless options of trails. It's fun to read all the informational signs available about history of Campbell airstrip and Anchorage. In the winter it's great for skiing and mushing! Always bring bear protection as this place is known to have some travel the area.
7847,Love the Budtenders & selection of Flowers. My Pug and I were welcomed and Deku was spoiled with Bacon ü•ì.

7850,Good. No American cheese. üòä thank you.
7851,So calm and peaceful. Beautiful
7852,"Fireside Books is always my go to for books, and has been for almost thirteen years. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and very customer focused.
My wife called them this morning to see if they had  three books in stock. They had one, and held it for us, and we have the other two on order. They even have managed to get hold of some out of print books for us in the past.
If you're in Palmer, or need a book, this is a wonderful place to visit. They often host local Alaskan authors for book signings and other events, which I've personally had the pleasure of being part of."
7853,Great location and helpful people.
7854,"Love this place, the ladies always make the best coffee! Oh and they spoil my brat dog so that's cool."
7855,I love this movie theater it is well run and clean. Grrat customer service and the movies might be a couple of months old but the it is at a huge discount price.  This is my favorite nostalagic movie theater in Anchorage and i try and support it by bringing my family here as often as i can.  I am impressed at how well they have kept it up.
7856,Run down
7857,Quiet
7858,Fantastic train journey from Denali to Fairbanks. Ordered the steak as advertised slow cooked. I asked for steak to be cooked well done. It was on plate in front of me in less than 5 minutes. It was anything from well done like eating rubber you could not chew it.
7859,Great store with great customer service
7860,"Mini Costco and grocery store, liquor store and gas station. If you dont feel like running to Costco great place to grab something quick ."
7861,treated me nice
7862,"Straight razors, hot towels, and real barbers."
7863,Great sandwiches and bakery
7864,Great shop and friendly staff
7865,The food was good and the atmosphere was nice.  The wait staff were wonderful.
7866,Food is good but this place needs a good cleaning.
7867,It was awful there were only 5 tables in the place and my food took about 30 minutes and it was cold I had breakfast French toast was soggy and tasteless the scrambled eggs had a burned bottom layer and the sausage was not warm so I was not sure it was safe to eat. The server never filled my drink during the 30 minute wait and left the bill with the food and disappeared.  This is not the first time I have eaten there and the other experiences were a wee bit better but this is the last one.
7868,"Service was friendly and fast, I always enjoy coming down to get my service done."
7869,Food was excellent! I made a reservation but we still had to wait just a few minutes.
7870,Always very clean and associates are friendly
7871,Probably the best bar food I've had. A lot of their food is made on the spot and fresh. A nice easygoing place for a burger and a brew.
7872,"If you come to Alaska and don't eat here you are doing it wrong. Sometimes there is a two hour wait, and it is still worth it. Get a beer and chill by the fire. Try the Diablo Breadsticks!"
7873,"Good food and service and we enjoyed the sports on many T.V.s
Around the room. Left here full and happy."
7874,Nice place
7875,"Food was hot and delicious, and the coffee was served within 2 minutes of ordering. Waitress was friendly and the place was clean, so this was all in all a very good experience."
7876,Once in a lifetime do experience these breathtaking views
7877,"This is my favorite go to dinner place. Their food is unique and so delicious. They always have wonderful beer available too. The patio is so nice in the summer months. I'd recommend the 49th state to everyone. Make sure to get a reservation or expect to wait, it's a very popular place."
7878,I love the pastas especially cheddar tarragon.. Vegetarian-friendly and big cookies!
7879,"The food was okay,  had a chicken burrito meal.  Rice and beans were decent.  The burrito was full of rice and then only had chicken and cheese."
7880,üî•üî•üî•üî• greatly priced and delicious food. More than enough to eat for dinner and lunch.
7881,Great drive
7882,"Best place to camp in cooper landing for red salmon fishing. Paved throughout no hook ups but each sit has a Punic table and fire pit. Well developed trails along the river. Extremely busy during the first two weeks of the fishing season or the month of June. Almost always have to make reservations months in advance for June and July. Early or later than that there are always a few sites open for drive up folks. Great place for the family, watch out for bears!"
7883,Best donuts in Anchorage. Love the chocolate boston cream! Donut holes are great too!
7884,"Yes! This is a nice cozy theater, with all the blockbusters."
7885,Great $6.00 lunches!!
7886,Wally world
7887,Uncomfortable seats
7888,"Very convenient, safe and clean. Reasonable prices"
7889,"This location is a good place to stop if you need a variety of items. It is fairly accessible from the highway.  The overall customer service is somewhat lacking, but there are some very helpful employees.  The prices are competitive with other businesses in the area."
7890,"The staff was nice, but our pizza wasn‚Äôt well done, in fact it seemed  semicooked."
7891,Very quick and nice coffee
7892,They never heard of pennypress!
7893,Pretty good
7894,Open all night and friendly staff
7895,"Best steak in town and with a show! I always order the hibachi steak with double order of rice, no noodles. And the yum yum sauce is so yummy! Would have given 5 stars but I absolutely hate the happy birthday song."
7896,loved it
7897,Amazing food!!
7898,The atmosphere was peaceful and the food was outstanding. Fresh and flavorful. I would recommend them to anyone!
7899,"I bought a KTUU deals from them. They stood me up twice. they are very unprofessional and when speaking in person with the ""son"" i felt threatened. I do not recommend them for any service."
7900,Great staff and very clean visitors center. Simple lay out and good displays.
7901,TACO KING! it's good stuff.
7902,I mean it's McDonald's its clean a play land
7903,Fantastic pizza as normal but the service was a touch slow. Not bad but not great either
7904,"This is my favorite brewery in Alaska!  It‚Äôs the perfect ski town local place with fantastic choices on tap and even Kombucha!  We had some great New Mexico green chile food from the Blue Rista food truck that was on site this week also.

The Apr√®s Ros√© is my absolute fave!  Hippy speedball, Woman no cryo and the nitro Girdwood reserve are also my top choices.  You can always get two flights, like we did, and try them all too!

Grab a hoodie or other swag too.  They‚Äôre super soft and comfy to relax in while sipping a beer with the beautiful mountain views around you.  Great staff with super friendly service too!"
7905,Only ate at the restaurant and bar area. Service and food was great
7906,Wore mask was good
7907,Such a great selection of fabric.

7910,Service has been excellent lately!
7911,Hands down my favorite burger
7912,Fun
7913,Awesome guys. All stars for Alfaro.
7914,Nice little Asian food market. This market has the largest selection of frozen items. Great for seafood. It‚Äôs tucked away and next to a housing area so keep your eyes open. It‚Äôs easy to miss.
7915,"Well, it tore one of my windshield wipers off. And to top it off, my car looked like it hadn't even been through the wash."
7916,Love to wander and see what's new.
7917,Great staff amazing food
7918,This best place on Earth
7919,Had an Anniversary lunch here. It was delish. I had the burger and my husband had taco's and bbq pork. Our waitress was amazing. She gifted me a beautiful Red rose. That made my day. We can hardly wait to go back.
7920,Had what I needed
7921,"Excellent customer service by Anthony, excellent knowledge of all types of vehicles at enterprise rental car is in Anchorage Alaska, supports the US military ember families and veterans.. I highly recommend this rental service to anyone who needs a car in Anchorage.Excellent Customer Service"
7922,It really is extremely fun
7923,Best hamburgers in town.
7924,Cute park has a geocache. Took a minute to find it!! But i did
7925,Will not be back again! We went here to do our thanksgiving shopping and happened to come across a good deal on an instant pot which my wife and i had been wanting for some time now the display read 8 quart instant pot normally 139.99 now 79.99 with a second additional coupon stating take an additional 20 percent off when we rang up we got in the so called ‚Äúfamily friendly line‚Äù when it rang up for 99.99 with 20 percent off i informed aileen (the cashier) that this was incorrect and that i must have grabbed the wrong product by this time the line behind me had grown two about 3 more people eventually she phoned a manager who didn‚Äôt show up for several more minutes meanwhile my wife went back over to the display to take a photo of the display and arrived back at the checkstand at the same time as the manager and upon showing them the coupon they again accused us of grabbing a larger size (which does not exist we then gave them time to read their own materials and the label on the box so they could sell it to me at the advertised price. I think there was just a problem with the way the barcode rang up but the way the employees handled it was horrible there was 5 or6 people in line at the end of it all and aileen should be fired for rudeness.
7926,"My favorite thrift store! Everything within each section is by color, want a grey sweater? They have a grey sweater section. Blue shirts? Blue shirt section. They always have sales and if you look through them you can find amazing brands like banana republic and cabi for cheap and barely used!"
7927,"Friendly staff, fairly priced!"
7928,Great tasting icecream! Experience could be better if the staff was not so blunt.
7929,"Delicious food. Fast service. Waitresses are friendly, smiley and have excellent customer skills. More eatery's should look at Rockies Cafe for what to do right!!¬°"
7930,"Our Waiter was great & the food was delicious. The only hassle was the Chef did not cook correct  salmon. We ordered Copper River reds, and the Chef prepared pink! Big taste difference!  So Waiter had to correct two orders! Which he did great! Over all it went well!"
7931,"I had my car towed to Midas with unknown issues when the weather was -40. The guys got my car in super quick and found the problem and fixed it for a very reasonable $84! This is the first time I have had to have my car worked on since I moved to Alaska, this shop is fast and very honest about the work that needs to be done. I will definitely use them in the future for all my car repair/maintenance needs."
7932,Great service
7933,"Dirty, and 2 check stands open with atleast 6 people in each line"
7934,These guys rule! A hidden gem üíé.
7935,"Simple, fresh and delicious breakfast burritos with complementary ingredients in ideal amounts and proportions. Don‚Äôt be thrown off by its location within a Shell station. There are definitely fancier and bigger burritos out there, but I can‚Äôt imagine a better-tasting one exists in all of Alaska."
7936,It was a small costco
7937,Fun place to take a group 6$ lunch
7938,"Very disappointing meal at the one place we usually can count on for a decent meal. Not many places in our home town of Homer, Alaska this time of year left open to go to on October 25th.

Leaving for our several month winter vacation we chose to have our last dinner in town at the Land's End Chart House. Not only do we love sitting with one of the most beautiful views during our meal, normally the food is very good.

My husband ordered a pan seared Halibut dinner. Homer being the Halibut Capital, we do quite often. His Halibut was cooked to beyond shoe leather. This was so unusual and there were only three tables of customers,  so they weren't so busy that it would be an excuse for such a terrible meal. Not only that his baked potato was barely luke warm, that the butter did not even melt.

We brought this to the attention of our waitress.  She could clearly see the fish was over cooked and the potatoes butter did not melt. She said she'd bring it to the attention of the cook after we explained they needed to know. We are locals we told her and understand some nights can be off, but wouldn't want tourists or our visiting friends or family from out of town to experience this bad of a meal.

Normally we would have been approached by a manager and offered not to pay for the meal, or a discount.  We were so shocked that our waitress after we told her and she took my husband's meal, came by with our bill, dropped it on the table and walked away. No manager, no mention of the terrible meal. We left payment and left the restaurant. I then was sorry we hadn't waited to speak with someone in charge. Jeannie our favorite bartender at the Chart House was working, although taking care of other diners in the lounge, because the dining room was closed. Wish we'd said something then, I hope it's better when we return."
7939,SOUP!
7940,Sweet
7941,"Awesome breakfast, very nice staff great place"
7942,Staff is awesome! Really on the ball even when things got crazy.
7943,Great place for a quick bite!
7944,Great place to eat breakfast. Friendly staff and good food
7945,"I went there to get a latte because they are open 24/7. They were very friendly, and the food looked good, but I only ordered a latte, and it was gross. I don't know how they made it, and if they have an espresso machine, I will not get any coffee drink that isn't plain black coffee from the Valley Hotel again. I didn't expect them to make drinks like Perkup, but I didn't expect it to taste so bad."
7946,Beautiful
7947,It doesn't take very long getting tires replaced
7948,Use scan and go!
7949,Music a bit too loud but service friendly
7950,"McDonald's, what's to explain"
7951,Good sushi
7952,"It's been my favorite place to go for birthday dinner, the people there have always been friendly enough to my family and I and they have a way cool chef who cooks some food for yeah in the kitchen. Their food is also delicious and provides enough variety for most picky eaters."
7953,"Awesome place for kids and information about the park.  You can check out an explorer pack for your kids for free with soil thermometer, ph strips, binoculars, etc. to use on your park adventures.  Really cool exhibits about wildlife and plant life in the park."
7954,"Best store in town. Has everything and has a well thought out, easy to find layout"
7955,Go on Tuesdays... With the rewards card popcorn is half off.
7956,"Clean, well maintained campground. Level campsites and the layout offers plenty of privacy. Boat launch has lots of dock space."
7957,Good burgers
7958,I tried to get a mirror cut they do not cut glass they are stole bought pieces of glass only
7959,Favorite pizza place in town. Love the DillyDilly
7960,"Used the be the best place in town for Big and Tall clothes, but thier Big and Tall section seems to get smaller and smaller each time I go. Much better to shop their online store as there are usually plenty of coupons to be found online and you can return it in store."
7961,good drinks and food. I take friends from out of town here a lot. Maybe a trying too hard to be like chain restaurants.
7962,Excellent center with lots of educational materials!
7963,Thanks to the covid19 they can't help you much. They are open but not really.
7964,Fun place. We actually love to go here for breakfast. The halibut Benedict is the best.
7965,The food here is fabulous! What a hidden gem!
7966,The pool here is always a disappointment. The water makes my lungs react so I can't breath and makes my kids cough. I can't swim here. The room wasn't cleaned well and some of the fixtures had been removed improperly leaving a run down appearance. The dining area and patio are beautiful though.
7967,"Great staff, and super fun for the family"
7968,Very nice stay. Breakfast was perfect and all the staff extremely friendly.
7969,People always friendly an D always accomidateing to customers.   They remember you excellent choice
7970,Don't go here. Multiple other taco bells around anchorage. For real this place hardly puts any beef bean or whatever. There is more lettuce than anything. The burritos are nearly empty so its nothing but tortilla. Let's not forget the absolute disregard for special orders. People pay money and the management is trash.
7971,Excellent service (especially Cat) and excellent beer.
7972,Knowledgeable and helpful. Always willing to help those trying to learn about products. The points system is nice also!
7973,Gas station with a convenience store. Good selection of grocery items though you are paying for the convenience.
7974,Always good
7975,Best high end dining in Fairbanks. Never disappointed and the staff are some of the absolute best. So many drink and wine options
7976,"Everything is delicious, and the churros are the best I've had..."
7977,Nice and clean place.
7978,"They had the best sale & i got some gorgeous bedroom, living room, & kitchen itemz that are beautifully made & were at almost 70% off...even got a couple of cute old fashioned looking sledz...miniature size..."
7979,"Amazing, the staff is very nice and helpful"
7980,"They're probably sick of me with how much I've been in there the last couple weeks. All the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, they've got me everything I've needed so far with 0 issues."
7981,Always can find what I'm looking for!!
7982,Great Food and Service
7983,They had what i needed
7984,Nice fresh seafood and beer with reasonable price
7985,Great time on this tour.
7986,Very good  lunch after cross country  skiing.
7987,Typical fast food Burger King.
7988,Wings were too salty
7989,"If you're looking for a possibly hard to find ingredient at a standard Alaskan grocer, try this store first! I was looking for baking ingredients and they had like 4 kinds of everything - fair trade and organics too!"
7990,"The prices are great ,great cell service, the workers don't leave any details hidden and over all they are quick about e erything"
7991,Has pretty much anything you need at a reasonable price
7992,Crowded
7993,Olive Garden lunch with me and 12 if my closest friends. Great
7994,Very nice staff
7995,If you're in the area like we were out was worth a look. Would not be a place to plan as a highlight with soo many beautiful natural sights to see.
7996,Food was decent. Endless of chips & salsa. Friendliest servers & attentive to our group of 25.
7997,I loved it        sea food is great
7998,Dirty and loud. Great staff.
7999,Fantastic cheese fries and a good draft selection.
8000,"Reasonably priced, friendly service, clean"
8001,"Love the people, didnt love the $85 bag of seeds."
8002,I always go there for my groceries! If you go enough you'll know it like the back of your hand. Really nice workers there aswell!
8003,"Nice environment, friendly people. But the food was not as good as it use to be. I miss the Old Chepos, it use to be my favorite restaurant."
8004,"It started with the first phone call last year. The women laughed when I asked for an appointment that week. Like I should know they were booked 8 weeks out! Then covid hit and the lobby is now closed so you have to sit in your car in the parking lot for 4 to 6 hours to be seen on a non-emergency basis. No appointments! I take my lily old chihuahua in for several reasons. No answers, just say he is fine, give him his shots and blood work. Price was fair and the people were nice that saw us last week. However his cough that I took him in for is much worse, so I call and the women is like, well...you can bring him back in for a recheck. She says it as of it's a huge bother. By the tone and the fact I already paid, I ask if the fee is covered by the first visit....of course not! Plus I will have to come in first thing and sit another four hours and wait again! Finding another vet! These guys were great when it was Diamond Animal Hospital!"
8005,What fun to walk the luminary lit trails of a beautiful winter wonder land.  God blessed us.
8006,Too expensive
8007,Always a long time in the drive thru... always
8008,Great customer service!
8009,Simply beautiful
8010,I have visited here many times for college fairs. Nice place right off the main road. A little tight for the college fair but it has worked very well as a location.
8011,"Only place I go to get my hair did, if the wait is five hours... It's worth it to sit there and suffer the packed house for a clean cut. They've got it right Everytime. Life's too short for a shaved head caused by no skills."
8012,Preatty good
8013,Rodney helped me with a samsung trade in phone offer and got me on a plan that helps lower cell phone plan costs through ATT.
8014,I had ART fix an issue with my 2014 ford super duty. They diagnosed and fixed the issue in the same day. Pricing was fair and consistent with the area. The team at ART really enjoys working on trucks and it shows with their customer interaction.
8015,Few shops in town not trying to rip me off
8016,"Clean , friendly,  will be back when needed."
8017,Delicious
8018,Food was not hot.
8019,Get new staff
8020,"Definitely underwhelming, margaritas tasted like they had absolutely no tequila, plates were hot but the food was bland and mediocre"
8021,Best cheeseburger in town!
8022,"So I spent all morning trying to take pictures of otters.. get off the boat and thus little guy created us, a shame I can't upload video, it was better"
8023,Beautiful even if it is raining!

8029,I get all I need in the morning in one spot here.
8030,"Great atmosphere, and drinks were EXTREMELY strong, and mind you, I am not complaining... I had 2 drinks, the house old fashioned and and special cosmo.. Recommended if your looking to catch a quick buzz after a busy day!"
8031,Friendly staff and decant surround sound but they could definitly have more comfortable seating. It was actually quite uncomfortable. :(
8032,"Very fantastic customer service, does anything they can to accommodate me.
Quick and easy check in process, and Spud the pilot is the best pilot I‚Äôve ever met!"
8033,Clean up sonething

8041,Good to order online and pickup.
8042,"Great room for the price, most affordable place in town. And helpful and knowledgeable front desk staff."
8043,Employees are very friendly however late at night there still seems to be 3-4 cars ahead of me in the drive thru and they take quite some time to get the orders out. Plus they're alywas out of stock for yogurt parfaits
8044,"I love this place.  The food is great, i mean GREAT, with large portions.  The beer comes by the liter if you want which really rocks and they have a great collection of the German brews on tap and bottled.  The service is very pleasant.  And holy only! The Apple strudel is amazeballz!"
8045,"(Translated by Google) Very good burgers, but their machine sodas are horrendous.

8048,Great burger joint!!
8049,Staff very nice.  Plus it's free right now!üòç
8050,Good fresh meat and veggies on sandwich.
8051,They were helpful and had the equipment to meet my needs.  The parking and loading area is very congested.
8052,"I'm very disappointed on how the food quality has changed. I had eaten here for years, up until I moved out of state in 2017 when it was still ""Shines."" I ordered back in July and the bento dinner box with the teriyaki chicken was disgusting, it wasn't fully cooked. The miso soup they somehow thought it was a great idea to add in onion and cilantro, which made the soup taste horrid. The only great thing about that 15-20$ dinner box was the streamed white rice.

I also noticed how much they've renovated inside their restaurant. What's the point of it looking very beautiful and renovated when the quality of their food has gone down the drain."
8053,Good food service is off and on
8054,Traditional shopping
8055,"Pedestrian food, uninspired."
8056,Waaaayyyyy better than Arby's
8057,The food and service is amazing!
8058,Best Airport in the USA

Their recommendations are expert and while their store has an almost overwhelming inventory, it is superbly organized with staff quickly and easily able to help locate what you're looking for. Their inventory is quality without having to worry about breaking the bank or spending too much. You get what you pay for does not necessarily apply here because the quality is consistent across the board. Every purchase has exceeded expectations.

The waitress was trashy looking hitting on my husband in front of me and kept interrupting us to talk to him. Not a good experience at all."
8213,Who does not love a glacier?
8214,"Awesome service. My 3 y/o son and I arrived a little early for takeout and he started to get whiny. One of the waitresses, all of a sudden, brought him a bowl of soup and some banchan! Super nice and it was on the house!"

8274,The direction was off it brought me to the back the building this review was for Google maps sorry about the confusion
8275,The most consistent Mexican food in Fairbanks. The lingua full of flavor and I make nachos villasana when I go in. I take one of there containers to go put three scoops of green salsa two scoops of pico de gallo and one scoop of each of the other salsa.

8291,The sites have some privacy and the owners are very pleasant
8292,"This place exudes Chinese restaurant. Chinese Lanterns on the ceiling and walls, a fish tank with rumbling water. We had a great experience and the woman who served us, I am assuming she‚Äôs the owner, was funny, accommodating, and quick to make sure we were good. The only draw back I found was the Eggroll that came with my meal was more like a tiny spring roll. Everything else was great."

8330,No crowds fast and friendly service. Clean and safe.

8334,"I came here on my birthday and I was happy with the food,  but the server spent all her time BSing with a customer and looked at you like you were rude for interrupting her to ask for more water.

8367,"Always find what I need...eventually. Can't find anyone to help, but that's usually the way of it. Over all better than Lowe's!"
8368,"So four stars for Not very pet friendly,  they ask you to leave you pets in your vehicle. Crazy *as parking lot!p
So I understand why, very congested with traffic and 75% of the individuals coming to gas up, junk food foraging aren't very cautious or thoughtful about where they're parking or pulling out! *sigh

The attendants at The Hub are helpful and accommodating.  And always hustling to keep things stocked, clean, sanitary and tidy!
There's alot to offer in this corner of Alaska

8382,"I loved the atmosphere and music they played. The wait to be seated was reasonable and I loved that you could get a cup of coffee while you waited. The wait for food was a little bit long, but the service was excellent. The food was delicious! If we are ever in Anchorage again, we will be coming back."
8383,"Shop here for kid stuff first, then go to the big box stores for the rest. You will save a ton of money."
8384,Nice  Employees Disorganized store
8385,Very friendly staff and patrons. Very reasonably priced drinks.

8403,Just need more offices.
8404,Quaint I like the couch seating up front and the tables in the back
8405,You have to try this on your trip. We went 3 times. Best breakfast in Anchorage forsure.

8414,With Colivid they don't have as much ad they used to
8415,Painless.
8416,Great food and drinks and good atmosphere. Sitting out on the patio when sun is out is hard to beat
8417,"3 of the games we played gave us no tickets when we were done playing, and a couple machines were not working. Couldn't find any staff to assist is so we left!"
8418,"The food is tremendous, we had the Tandori chicken and chicken curry, which includes a portion of salad, rice and spiced chicken all of which was very well cooked. The wait was non exsistent even with a steady stream of people. The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is the pricing is a little high. Prices range from $10-$15 for the meals and the naan, which is absolutely delicious and fresh, is $5 a piece."
8419,"Good service, but there was some sort of ground thing going on with the speakers"
8420,It's a typical Safeway
8421,Much like Safeway great store

8437,Expensive but great People fast service and very informative
8438,Nice place to get lunch clean and fast
8439,You can never go wrong with getting lunch or dinner from Pita Pit in Soldotna. They load up the meals and its always enough for two meals for me. Good prices and amazing customer service.
8440,Excellent..well worth a visit !
8441,Very polite and explained what they were doing and why
8442,"Today, my mom and I went to the Carr's on Debarr. My mother made the decision to go through the self check, and everytime we would put one thing after it was scanned. The lady said, the bag stand was a scale."
8443,"UPS' system is customer-unfriendly, and it's unfortunate they don't care enough to do something about it.  I paid for an international over-night shipment, which, I even asked to pick the package up in person ( doing the work for them ) at their receiving center because the holiday was coming up.  They would not allow me, and I ended up waiting 2 more days.  I called to request the delivery address me updated because I was going to be 2 blocks away from my residence, and an employee asked if I just wanted to pick up the package.  I said if I was not available that would be an acceptable option.  The UPS driver showed up in my neighborhood 2 hours after, and drove right past my house.  After checking my tracking information, it was changed so that my package was ""pick up only"" and now I HAVE to wait 7 hours for the vehicle to return to the main center for me to go pick it up.  They're officially as bad as USPS.  2.1 rating on 19 reviews, and it's ridiculous they don't care enough to address some of these concerns.  What a way to ""do what's right for the customer""."
8444,"Beer flight was very good, and the king crab legs were delicious! Service was also very good"
8445,Kiddo days
8446,"This is a great wine store. They have an awesome wine selection and the staff seemed very knowledgeable. I will definitely be a regular here. The only thing I noticed was- there really aren't any bottles under $14.99. They have great wine, so it's totally worth it- I am just used to looking for bottles between $7.99-12. The extra few dollars is worth it, it will just take some getting used to. They also have a wine club, which I will look into joining."
8447,The top floor restaurant was amazing but a little over priced. Especially the drinks and desserts. You're definitely paying for the view
8448,"Had a great breakfast Today, pancakes were very light and fluffy. Egg be edict the best I have had for a long time. Well worth a visit."
8449,"Nice and clean,almost typical American diner,just a little bit better. Burgers ,fries, pies, etc.Breakfast is being served all day. Prices are very reasonable ,highly recommend! Oh, and it has some Russian traditional meals as well"
8450,Good price and selection of home electronic devices. Purchased several items here that I could not find anywhere else.

8452,Amazing  service üëè
8453,Great coffee
8454,Food good
8455,"So this place has been a lunch spot for my wife and I for years to the point where I felt obligated to only go there out of loyalty. I never complained about the dry sandwiches or wilted lettuce in the salad or even the sub par service from a select few of the waitstaff. (don't get me wrong the staff is good for most part just a few bad apples that forget to put customer service 1st) We'll today my wife ordered me a tuna sandwich to go, I cam I picked the sandwich the lady had a little attitude but understandable I was the one who ordered the sandwich but was picking it up while my wife got her nails done. A few mins after picking m y sandwich up my wife was done with her nail appointment I asked if she wanted lunch as well she said yeah I want some soup from perfect cup. We walked over to the perfect cup and we took a seat like always the lady proceeded to come over and tell us that because we cant eat here because we had a to go order sandwich even though my wife wanted to order a soup for herself to eat. I am absolutely applaud with the way this went down and to make a long story a little shorter my wife and I will have to start a new tradition because we will never go to the NOT SO PERFECT CUP again."
8456,Staff is super friendly and more then enough people to help multiple people at once. Really good selection and good quality product.
8457,"Eklutna Lake is a great place to kayak.  Make sure you dress for rain and wear layers.  Remember Eklutna Lake is glacier water, so the water temperature is about 38f.  There are kayak and bike rentals at the Lifetime Adventures Eklutna Visitor Center.

8496,"Fair selection, but steep prices, and is conveniently located near the Green line bus stop."
8497,This is one of my favorite places to shop designer brands for a great price.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I like how they don‚Äôt ask you if you need help every 10 seconds like most stores do also.  Everything is neat and well organized which makes shopping fun and efficient.
8498,Nice
8499,You have to really like country music.
8500,Love the Impossible Burger
8501,"Love the setting‚úà, the friendly service ü§ó , the music üé∂, the food is absolutely divine! üôåü•∞ The salad and kombucha before the amazing pizza was deliciousioso üëå I'm definitely returning for more! üòãüòÅ"
8502,"Positive atmosphere, prompt and courteous service, and very knowledgeable about merchandise."
8503,"This review is specifically for the Starbucks in this Target.

I visited today (8/11/16) with my husband and stopped by the Starbucks around 8:30pm for a drink. There were two girls working and the young girl with very short hair asked for our orders. We weren't ready yet, so I apologized and told her I hadn't decided yet. She immediately had a tense/exasperated look on her face, so my husband and I both checked to see if anyone was behind us that we could let go ahead. There wasn't anybody, so we looked at the menu some more. I asked the girl at the register if she had a copy of Starbucks' secret Frappucino menu that I've seen at other locations. I was greeted with a terse response about how they aren't required to have it and it's just normal drinks with added mixins but reluctantly offered to make me one if I told her what it had in it. I explained that I could only remember that it was called a Butterbeer Frappuccino. No response, just a continued look of annoyance. After an awkward pause, my husband asked me again if I wanted anything, at which time I decided I would rather not do business with your Starbucks and politely said I was just going to get a drink when we got home. My husband was also getting off-put by the cashier's attitude, so he apologized to the girl and said we didn't need anything because he also decided he didn't want to be there anymore. No response from her (aside from the glare I'd gotten familiar with during this exchange) as we turned and left.

Now, before I get written off as ""just another whiny customer"", I know how hard it can be in retail. I worked in retail for 4 years, part of which was at a Starbucks in a grocery store. I know how badly some people treat retail employees, so I always do my best to be friendly and polite. You never know what kind of jerks people have dealt with all day and I know it can wear people down. My experience also taught me how to appreciate the friendly and laid back customers that came in. Even on the worst days, I could still muster a smile and a decent attitude for at LEAST the nice customers. There is unfortunately no excuse for the way she treated my husband and I. We weren't rude or disrespectful to her. At worst, we were just being a little slow to order, which didn't seem like a problem with the absence of other customers.

Maybe this girl was just having an exceptionally bad day and let her mood get the best of her. Maybe she felt bad about her behavior after we left. All I know is that I haven't had that unpleasant of an experience with an employee in a long, long time and I hope it doesn't happen again."
8504,One of the best spots in Anchorage - I've lived in Anchorage from 2014 to 2019 and I can say that this is one of my favorites. Good food + good view + reasonable pricing = True Alaskan Restaurant
8505,One of my new favorites!!!
8506,Great place to grab a coffe and get out of the cold.
8507,Good food quick and easy and always fresh :)
8508,Great food at a good price! Large buffet come with BBQ
8509,Love the sugar shack
8510,"Fast service, great selection, friendly staff.
Can't beat it in the Fairbanks area.
Try ThirdStates thin mint cookies!"
8511,"Will revisit review after ""the newness"" wears off. Order of soup and slider burger was brought to the table as a single pulled pork style burger with different fries (so wrong on multiple counts). Was told my original order would be rushed through. Waiter then visited table much later to ask if I wanted a to go box for the item I didn't order and didn't touch, not knowing/recognizing that I had the wrong item AND that my original order had not been ""pushed through"" - I cancelled my soup at that point. And they had run out of the specific drink we were looking to get.

Finally got the slider burgers and chuckled to myself when I got home to see that it's simply a 4 pack of King Hawaiian Buns cut in half, a single patty laid on top of it with cheese, the other half of the rolls on top, then cut into quarters. I mean, I guess I wasn't expecting actual slider sized burgers cooked but the trick of it made me genuinely laugh.

The Play side of things was impressive. It'll be interesting to see how they're able to keep things going since it's an obscenely large space with so many games to keep powered up. The Eat side..... Not so much."
8512,Excellent food and staff
8513,"Great customer service. Has most brands in stock, prices are little higher/same but you get points for discounts with membership. Has most what you need for exotic, farm and pet needs."
8514,I just bought a 2018 Tundra from EZ at Kendall! He was very personable and friendly!
8515,"Beautiful views,  convenient parking"
8516,Great people
8517,Nice playground. Lots of snow in winter. Heated bathrooms.
8518,"Good views of Cook Inlet, and I image up towards Denali when it's clear (gray and wet when I was there).  Lookout structure itself is pretty impressive (you can see everything looking down), but it's showing its age and probably needs some love.  No sitting area either."
8519,"We had a wedding hair emergency, and the girls, especially Bobbi (?), stepped up and we're incredible"
8520,If you have a wiled crafter. You need to stop here it has every thing you could want
8521,It doesn't sell Vapes for smoking weed. I think it should. It would increase sales for them. It is simply a smoking bar. To that affect.
8522,My son and I just love you guys
8523,Gotta get the toast burrito thing
8524,"American tire is great to deal with. I've dealt with them many times to have tires purchased or fixed. Most recently I brought my wife's car in to have the tire fixed, which end up turning I to bend rim. They go above and beyond to make sure that your back on the road as quickly and safely as possible."
8525,Great venue without a bad seat in the house.
8526,The resort is always a great place to visit with friendly staff and a warm enviroment
8527,Good 24/7 grocery store. Easy access on your way out of Anchorage.
8528,Always good food and fast
8529,Ice skate sharpening the best
8530,Good place for new toys.
8531,"Excellent Dinner! Never have had a bad meal, great trailer parking"
8532,"(Translated by Google) Service theft

(Original)
Goid service"
8533,YUM!
8534,"Went to the hotel for dinner before we flew out, the meals and was very tasty and a generous sized size. The staff were also extremely helpful and happy"
8535,"Store was clean, shelves were stocked, cashier was quick and friendly, plus its in a good location."
8536,"I respect the baristas, but damn.  If you're going to spend over $5 on a coffee it should be strong and complex.  Every drink I've had tastes like milk and they don't have any of the syrups that every other coffee shop has. Where's my Bob Marley or my Nutty Irishman?  I'd rather make my own coffee, sorry."
8537,"One of our favorite spots to go. The scenery is absolutely stunning. There are tons of trails on Seward Highway to pull of and hike. Beluga point is a place that is great for photographers, families, and tourist. Bring a jacket because you will get quite the chill from the wind coming of the ice , cold water."
8538,"It's a taco bell, not much more to say about it.  The food is overall good, but there are some days (around evening, 6pm akst) where it can be a bit lacking."
8539,Has a play place and it is a great place for kids.
8540,That roast beef and Cheddar
8541,Halibut taco's are very good. As is everything else.
8542,Awesome
8543,It's so tiny now.
8544,Usually only have one check stand open.
8545,Best private club in Anchorage!
8546,You can find anything  for home  that you  need to  get  that  you need.
8547,"Books <3
Great cafe and kind staff"
8548,Could improve the wait time
8549,Awesome
8550,"Decent customer service, usually good about keeping items stocked, lines aren't usually as long as the other Walmart stores in Anchorage. Pharmacy is pretty quick about filling prescriptions and they usually have most medications in stock."
8551,A must stop spot on the Seward Highway.
8552,Good portions decent breakfast
8553,Great course but the minimum age is 6 so I can‚Äôt even bring my kid along with me.
8554,6 am good food
8555,Always have overcharges on my receipts but they will correct it when you tell them.
8556,Was pretty disappointed.  The broth was not particularly special nor were the prices.  If you want Japanese style Ramen in Anchorage this is pretty much your only option.  It could satisfy your cravings but I've definitely had better in Canada and on continental us.
8557,Best. Pizza. Ever.
8558,The people there are very friendly and helpful. The lobby is very clean and welcoming. Their groomer Michael is awesome and loves each of his furry clients andis very upfront with what us best for your furry best friend.
8559,Staff is always on point. Clean. Costco is always on point. Great deals quality through and through.
8560,They are very helpful no matter time of the day.
8561,The groomer I had was awesome
8562,Been coming here for years sometimes they are polite other times they are very rude.  Like today very rude sorry I forgot to sign lady you don't have to talk to me like garbage I give your location money almost every day
8563,When you walk in and sit down and looks like it's not going to be good just by how things look around but I'll tell you what their food is delicious and they are very friendly people
8564,Always have all that a person needs  for every craft idea
8565,Expensive but they have everything for your Trucking needs
8566,Great place. Recommend it for your travel needs.
8567,"Really good prices, fun and very friendly staff, Eyemart off sandlake couldn't get me my lens because of my frames even though I originally bought them there, sent me out of the door, Lens crafters wanted me to wait 14-16 business days to order my lens, tried these guys, they had my glasses done in half an hour, and fixed a part that was broken on them, wonderful staff and I would recommend them to anyone, the manager was super nice and funny to talk to. in the end, great customer service, price and quality."
8568,"Really nice place. Have not had everything but prices are fair, quality is top. I love all of their bacon, house special beans, and smoked chickens. They may be the best smoked chickens I've had in Alaska. Nice staff as well."
8569,Excellent service and food...been around since 70s...maybe 60s...awesome renovation
8570,The atmosphere is cozy and the cookies are huge!
8571,Yummy and great atmosphere!
8572,Never disappointed! Get a custom drink and breakfast bagel ü•Ø
8573,Happy respectful people.
8574,"Friendly staff. Great place to chill with friends, but the internet gets slow sometimes when it gets busy"
8575,"Their bays are frequently closed. Common to have only one, or even none open."
8576,My favorite vape shop
8577,Interesting exhibits. If you're in Seward for a couple of days...it's worth a visit. $30 entry fee for non-residents.
8578,Worried about door dash then sitting customers down poor service joke of a restaurant
8579,"Good good, good beverages, great service! Fun place with live music."
8580,Always a good time!!
8581,"Good food, decent service. Can be a little loud at times. Beer selection is one of the best."
8582,I went in to the bar with my wife to meet up with some friends we had all had a good time that night
8583,Great service and friendly.
8584,Yeah yeah everybody loves this place. The menu fine whatever on the wait. But when your bill is $19 and you pay with a 50 and get your change in 1s. That's just plain rude. I had to go to the bar to get real change.
8585,"I‚Äôve only been here twice, but the customer service has been good, both times. The wait for pizza is minimal and the pizza is great! I would also like to point out that they have great ranch. Lol I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, and will be returning."
8586,Best burger in town ....hands down we will be back !! I like that u can sit and watch the cook make your food‚òï
8587,"Great produce! Quick, in and out."
8588,This is the best place to get tires. The staff is awesome and really helpful. I'm always coming here.

8597,Alittle expensive but great place and great food
8598,Expensive booze but at least there are many homeopathic remedies for E.D. right at the register.
8599,The always do a amazing job and reasonably priced. The only place I'll take my fur baby.
8600,Beer selection is much smaller but the pizza and staff were both pretty good.
8601,"Great for dinner, not lunch."
8602,"The best outdoor store in Alaska. A little of everything and a lot of inventory. Buy a drink from the cafe and walk around the store.  Get your refills and then relax in front of the fireplace.  You'll find clothing and other items that are from the Bass Pro Shop.  If you didn't know, Cabela's was bought by Bass Pro Shop.

8603,The water is worth the stop. They also have filtration equipment available and large containers and of course free filling
8604,Great trails for biking!
8605,I've  always enjoy eating here. Good food reasonably priced. You certainly won't find a better place for Mexican food.
8606,"MJ's is a great local tabletop game store. They have tables set up for magic, x-wing, warhammer and whatever else you can think of. They regularly host events to encourage new people to come check out the store.

I went with my son for a Miniature painting event and they gave us free minis to paint, provided paints, brushes and everything we needed to get started.  They gave us a beginner's tutorial and were super helpful during each of the steps. While we were there they ordered pizza for everyone free of charge.

I highly recommend checking the place out to get your game on, paint a few minis, or just hang out with some great local nerds."
8607,The seating/recliners are awesome. Concessions are over priced even for a movie theatre. Be careful of matinee popcorn - the popcorn is definately left over from the night before.
8608,It's Walmart -- not run down and it's not Target.
8609,"Fun, lively, and good food."
8610,Produce is sub par and pretty knarly looking. The meat ain't the freshest either
8611,I was going here since they had their soft opening and they have the best wings in Anchorage on top of the best service.  The owner(s) really want their customers to enjoy the meal and want to come back and I've witnessed that numerous times.  The best flavor on their menu is the garlic sriricha.  You can't go wrong with 907.
8612,Nice location üëå
8613,Great store
8614,Guides are nice and well informed.
8615,Great prices and many fun finds

8620,It's was bad before but now it's good
8621,Great foos and service .
8622,Owner is a cool guy and employees are berry knowledgeable and extremely friendly. Always only have top shelf product. No trim doobies always flower. The point system for the rewards program is top notch. They're just north Kenai by a mile or so. I'd say it's probably in your best interest to go see Clint and his Crew
8623,Okay...needs some working on and repairing and remodeling painting looks really old
8624,"Everything you need, and some things you don't.  Staff is helpful. Security in parking has made trips at night less risky."
8625,Eat fresh
8626,So good!
8627,This place has some of my favorite foods and the servers there are so nice and one of my best friends parents work there.
8628,Left my truck clean and that shine remained longer than I expected.
8629,Hotel was nice. The view is the best I've seen. The lady checking me in and the guy checking me out were a little lacking in hospitality though
8630,Good prices for on sale items
8631,Nice place and very clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. They can get backed up when it's busy but that's to be expected. Every thing was fresh and delicious and the theater was clean. I'll definitely return.
8632,Fantastic staff great prices
8633,Go for 2$ taco Tuesday and you can't go wrong. 3/4 is a big meal. You do the math. Comes with salsa and limes(plural).
8634,A 5 isn't high enough of a rating for the team here at JD Styles! Excellent customer service from the moment we walked in the door. The professionalism and knowledge this team has is the best I've seen in all of Fairbanks and North Pole area. This was our first visit here and definitely not the last. Keep up the great work y'all!
8635,"We don't have many options here in Delta Junction therefore this place deserves 4 stars just for the fact that you can watch TV, eat, drink and play pool. Staff are locals most of them very polite and serviceable."
8636,very knowledgeable staff
8637,Good and service was good.
8638,Excellent car wash with an excellent monthly price! The young people scrubbing my truck before I enter the car wash are very polite and do a great job!
8639,Awesome place üòâ...
8640,"When my folks come to visit from Maryland they always take our kids. A tradition so to speak. The pancakes are a win for sure, especially the chocolate chip ones. I personally like the skillets. You won't walk away starved! Lunch choices are good too! Great service!!"

8647,Close to home
8648,Yard work is know better here.
8649,They put a cute little bandana on my pupper

8651,The best halibut I've ever had. And our server was delightful!
8652,Nice theater
8653,Clean and I can all ways find what I need.

8658,Great place for dental
8659,Quick check out.
8660,Favorite place for lunch
8661,"Always dirty, staff is slow and will be sure to service their friends before you. The soda fountain drain smells so terrible I will never get a drink there. This place is in dire need of new management, new staff and a new owner for that matter. One who cares about their store and will physically check up on it regularly. And if the online is checking up on it, and has done nothing, then the owner is even more so terrible for the brand name I once enjoyed."
8662,"Theresa is just A-W-E-S-O-M-E :) I always had a specific person take care of me, since my teenage years and I am really picky! It was hard to find someone I liked again, when I moved to Anchorage. I have been seeing Theresa, since last summer. She surprised me in a very nice way, she is not only good in what she does, but also has a great spirit! Thank you so much, Theresa! You have a great pull haha :)"

8678,Very friendly staff
8679,Best place in anchorage or eagle river. Better than moose's tooth
8680,Very professional and knowledgeable staff. I dont smoke but they have many useful products.
8681,"Great pizza- very huge and tasty. Beer is nice too as any homebrewed beer...update: the best pizza i've ever eat across world üåç
Better to come before 6pm during week and before 4-5pm on weekends if you do not want to stay in waiting list.
Every pizza can be tasted without any hesitation- guaranteed.
Large pizza size- i was eating this two days :-)
This place is recommended for any new Anchorage visitors!!!"
8682,This place is amazing! The customer service was great! The chocolate covered jellies were addictive! The selection of jellies and jams was fantastic! I have to go back so I can try more things!
8683,"Horrible repair work.  Didn't fix things that were broken and broke things that were fine.  This place was recommended by the insurance company after sometime hit or vehicle.  They deny costs of repairs under their ""lifetime warranty"".

This place is a joke."
8684,"Slow slow slow.  Its McDs food as expected but  Always slow.  This morning I went thru the drive through and ordered 2 sausage McMuffin with out egg.  I was 3rd in line. It took a bit of time, I got to the window.  I waited, I could see the staff talking with each other.  After 3 minutes, the guy came to the window and asked me to park and they would bring it out.  I just left.

I don't understand.  3 ingredients - muffin, cheese and sausage party.  No coffee, no hash browns no drink.  I thought these were standard breakfast items readily available.

It's the slowest fast food around!"
8685,As always; the food and atmosphere is great! Always enjoy coming here before a symphony.
8686,Great customer service always willing to go the Xtra steps to help you out
8687,Hand's down one of the best places to have breakfast in Anchorage. Had the steak and eggs and Loco Moco. Both came out very good. Portion sizes were also huge. Highly recommended!
8688,What a great Visitors center that helps educate you on all park related facts.  Leave an hour or so to tour this great center.
8689,Customer service sucks no one was at there department and they told me to go wait in line to cash my check mid town is better then this Wal-Mart
8690,Food was ok. But not the best.
8691,I walked in 1st thing in the morning and they fixed 2 rock chips.  Very fast service.

8695,Love this place! My top favorite take-out place in south anchorage.

8698,Love this place
8699,Always good every once in awhile
8700,"This is the first summer we have used Mosquito Guards Services. So fast the results have been marvelous. We're can actually hang outside with our being swarmed by mosquitos. They come spray every few weeks, only takes 15-20 mins for little under an acre. It was around $600 for the whole summer."
8701,Very friendly and helpful staff
8702,"The guy was friendly and helpful. He didn't seem bothered by my rambunctious 18 month old wanting up, down, running around etc and was plenty patient with me while I dealt with the little imp, despite it being closing time."
8703,"Great food. Entertaining
environment."
8704,Reasonably priced and great for people to take showers in case you have a dry cabin
8705,"I had the bacon Caesar salad, it was good, lots of bacon, not enough dressing. Friendly service, a little pricy for what you get. Lots of TVs."
8706,"Love the rolls and the ribsüòç meat just falling off the bone was delicious. Prices was ok but it's to be expected for the good food. Friendly staff, timing for food took a little while but was worth the wait.
House salad was on point wellüòÅüòç"
8707,Food was good. Waitress was awesome!
8708,Guys got here on time and glass was in and cleaned in no time!

8712,Always clean
8713,"The ""dirty chips"" were very sweet tasting, which is not my preference. But they were good. The wings were average. Average airport place."
8714,1 word...amazing.
8715,"(Translated by Google) The pitch is OK, the technical facilities are a bit older but everything worked. The pitches are partially separated with hedges, the staff is unusually rude, especially the boss, the place is characterized by tour groups, quite a bit of unrest, the restaurant is very good and the washers / dryers were many and top.

(Original)
Der Stellplatz ist OK, die technischen Einrichtungen sind schon etwas √§lter aber es funktionierte alles. Die Stellpl√§tze sind teilweise mit Hecken getrennt, das Personal ist ungew√∂hnlich unfreundlich, insbesondere die Chefin, der Platz ist gepr√§gt von Reisegruppen, ziemliche Unruhe, das Restaurant ist sehr gut und die Waschmaschinen / Trockner waren viele und top."
8716,Great place to bring the family for great prices as well.
8717,Quality steel ATV trailer. I ordered a 5x8 footer that wasn't assembled yet on a Friday at 4:00 p.m. and they had it ready by 2:00 p.m. the next day
8718,I am not fond of spicy foods and I got a  big surprise when I took a bite out of the bread and it took a long time to get our food but I like all of the decorations and the people there are so nice.
8719,Average mall nice food court
8720,Its alright but its too expensive for the quality of food you get. Theres better and cheaper food in town.
8721,Great family diner!
8722,Great place to go
8723,"Awesome food! However, the horrible service left us with a bad taste in our mouth. Our rude server and bus boy did not want to be bothered with having to pretend we were worth talking to. And to top the evening off our credit card was charged twice. When I called to get it taken care of. I was told I would have to leave a message. I still have not received a call back. If our food was not so good I would have tried to give this place a -3 rating. We would have enjoying eating at Taco Bell more."
8724,It favorite place for Mexican food. Great taco salad
8725,Food is meh at most but the games are great. Customer service was ok
8726,Pizza was hot and correct AND the delivery even came early. Will I order again? Hell yes. This was my first time ordering from this location and I'm pleasantly surprised.
8727,Awesome food
8728,"One of my favorite places for 4-wheelering.  Very busy on the summer weekends.  Tons of trails to explore.  Large public parking lot for off loading and loading your machines with new bathrooms open in the summer time.  Please be careful and courteous of other riders.  You will encounter all skill levels from first timers to advanced racers.  The trail that goes off the ""left"" of the parking lot and runs along the gravel pit is a very easy ride for first timers.  Be aware that the gravel pit is private property.  If you get all the way to the glacier watch out for moose.  They love to hang out along the river."
8729,My favorite coffee hut in the state. Best prices and the most consistently tasty espresso products. It doesn't matter the day of week or time of day your order will taste great.
8730,Took the evening onboard dinner cruise.  The food was very good and the scenery was spectacular.
8731,Food
8732,"Great Pizza, Convenient Location and Fast Service."

8737,Great place
8738,Typical

8747,Great staff always polite. Good prices
8748,"Got off from the cruise ship.... walking distance about 15 minutes to the train station.

Love the cute little train station. The staffs at the ticket office are super friendly. There is a gift shop and snacks shop. You can do some shopping or grab a coffee while you are waiting for the train!

The view is gorgeous and love to witness part of the history."

8761,A bunch of stuffs to look from. üëçüèª
8762,Convenient. Friendly staff.
8763,"It's a Safeway, so... Are they really any different from each other? I will say that the produce is not as good as A&P post Barge Day, but it is slightly more convenient. They have self check out, which I love. Starbucks is inside. Fresh doughnuts each day. The pharmacist, Hannah, is so amazing. Kind, professional, and straight forward. Caught a drug error and saved my life! Deserves a raise."
8764,"We had to stop into Pagoda since it was featured on Food Network and we were in the area. When we got there, it was busy but we were greeted immediately and only had to wait briefly for a table. There weren't any obvious gluten free options on the menu but when we asked our waitress, she gave us plenty of options for gluten free items. The food came out super quick and was tasty. There were tons of huge shrimp in the fried rice and the shrimp and garlic sauce. The sweet and sour pork was very crispy. Super tasty!"
8765,Great appetizers. I can't wait to go back.
8766,"Always very friendly staff, enjoy shopping here and love their sales! Great selection of outdoors gear"
8767,"Best spot for cards, comics, and related merch."

8773,Great place for service men and women to learn how to fix their own vehicles themselves and save some dough at the same time
8774,Ok food.
8775,Quick and good service. Will go back again and again. Reasonable tap beer selection as well.
8776,"Best breakfast in town, there is often a wait, so arrive early.  The food is tasty and fresh.  The menu is upscale Alaska diner food.  Well worth a trip here.  The drip coffee served with breakfast is garbage."
8777,Convenient storage facility.
8778,Very nice atmosphere great food and service!
8779,Bright shiny people
8780,Quick and good service
8781,They really need to staff more cashier's.

8784,"The best in North pole, service was fast."
8785,Everything here is very expensive for what it is but the facility is clean and the kids have fun each time we go.
8786,"Overprice. Check online first because you can get it for about half the price off of Amazon or other online store.

They will not take anything as a return even if you haven't opened it yet.

Will not go back."
8787,Family friendly! Also has amazing doughnut sticks now!
8788,Verry good l like
8789,"Good service, good drivers, much better then yellow cab. For the other reviews saying they couldn't get one. Not every company is perfect but I will say one company that's doing a good job of trying to get everyone where they need to go is checker.

DON'T TAKE YELLOW CAB. They are not going your way 24hrs a day."
8790,Got a good jug of distilled water and never got wet. Nice store here in Soldotna Alaska.
8791,"Clean, great food, I'd stay again."
8792,This is southeast alaska with a place called Northern tea house. NORTHERN tea house
8793,Good customer service!!
8794,Didn't necessarily need a mask everybody else had one on it was easy in and out because easily find things
8795,"As a travel agent:  The Westmark has   the best location in downtown Anchorage.  Diagonal  from it is  the souvenir shops and restaurants. Although it does hold a restaurant which gets busy and a small coffee area-which is so crowded in the morning.
It is close to the bus stop which can take you back to the airport. Just 1 block from the start of the Idiatrod race. Which is great since you can view the snow making, the dogs getting ready. Soundproof windows block the noise below so you are guaranteed a good night's sleep.
Free internet,connecting rooms avl, restaurant, coffee shop in the hotel too.

Great staff always willing to serve, help and recommend places and things to do.
Nice lobby with a fireplace to meet and greet friends.
Good prices even in busy season, big parking lot."
8796,Vast selection of food
8797,"Pretty good chain. The place is clean, and the food is exactly what you'd expect from qdoba"

8802,Love the kebobs
8803,"Friendly, helpful & understanding staff. Car was new and in great shape."
8804,Drunks hanging outside even sleeping on the sidewalk.really guys clean your act up and fly straight
8805,Have just about anything you need
8806,"Nice, but small, new rooms. Large bathrooms. Door keys work one time in ten which gets really annoying late at night. Wasn't just our room keys either. Our entire group had issues so maybe it s just a bad batch. Wifi is so slow it proves useless so don't plan on that being of assistance."
8807,Good burgers...
8808,Good for getting koolaid.
8809,Not very many shops!
8810,The best place in Juneau to grab a bite and drink!!! They have some of the best bartenders in town!!! Awesome atmosphere and fair prices!!!
8811,"this trail is boring. There are way better areas in AK. If you're cramped for time, sure, go for it. But if you want epic views and less people, head somewhere else."
8812,It's a treat. A getaway close by
8813,"The store is clean and well stocked and the laundromat attached is new, equally clean, and the machines work perfectly. I will definitely be coming back here more often."
8814,A great place to attend church and have a home cooked meal;
8815,"Clean, friendly, a little bit of everything..."
8816,Delicious salads and they accommodated my needs - my allergies are bad- hands down customer service. We will return.
8817,Looking for a certain kind of book to a variety in a nice and cozy and calming place. This is your spot. Everyone is nice and professional and will gladly help you find what your looking for. I recommend every book lover to come here.
8818,Moon runs a wonderful restaurant! I enjoy the atmosphere!
8819,"Have been going to Halo for many years now. Whether you're looking for a cut, color, or other treatment, they take good care of clients. Walk in feeling tired and frazzled, walk out feeling refreshed and fabulous. I agree with another reviewer who said Halo is probably the best in Anchorage."
8820,"One of my favorites! The quality is consistently good whether in Anchorage, Homer, or Soldotna. I love the fajitas and the seafood chimichanga (it has real crab, not fake)."

8825,Nice clean and work is done in a timely manner.
8826,Great quarter pounders

8829,Upscale Restaurant/Cafe with a great menu and excellent gin and tonic drinks
8830,Beautiful place!!!!
8831,"Clean, pleasant, and SUPER BUSY! But the hairdressers we're still very nice."
8832,Delicious food as always.  And very friendly staff.
8833,"Barely any wildlife except a few ducks.

Why? Maybe because it's literally across the highway from a GUN RANGE.  Gun shots can clearly be heard in this Marsh by humans, let alone animals.   Why is it a good idea to put a gun range across a wild animal marsh?

That's just lacking common sense and obviously dumb.  Why would moose or reindeer go TOWARDS gun shots?"
8834,10/10 would French fry again
8835,Nice restaurant

8838,The salesman was a lying scumbag. Don't trust them. I will never buy from this dealership again.
8839,The food and service was very good the only con with the restaurant is that the prices are expensive here
8840,Love the espresso!!
8841,Very helpful employees and polite cashier's.
8842,I booked a trip for the glaciers and security  comes bothering me on 9-25-2015 and said that I couldn't say in the lobby and wait
8843,I loved my experience at this nail spa.
8844,"This is an awesome hike! It's almost 2 miles from the Basin road to the tram but can be done in 60-90 mins if you're in good shape.  It's pretty much uphill the entire way (it is a mountain after all) but the trail is very well maintained.

Use hiking boots or tennis shoes with good grip as a few places can be a bit slippery if it's been raining. Overall this is one of the best hikes in the downtown area. Once you get past the tramway and continue up you have some of the best views of Juneau."
8845,My fav coffee shop to go to. The girls that own the place are super sweet. The other baristas are amazing. I sometimes have them surprise me with a drink and they never disappoint.
8846,"Good food, but not high quality."
8847,"Pizza sause wasnt the best choice, taste like it is spoiled or something or maybe its just the sause, but great little place where you can have a beer and relax, there are cabins for rent right next to them."
8848,My go to place for bads.
8849,"Very nice waitstaff. The pho portions are fair, had a large and was satisfying. Ox tail gets you two portions, not complaining; just so anyone knows who is craving.

Thai tea is good, different recipe than others in town and i like the varoety. I would commend those ladies for handling such a large party while i was there and keeping the place running well and so politely.

Good job PHOnatik!"
8850,My family was buying pet food so I just wandered around. Looked at all the kitchen stuff really nice some useful and some for setting a tone or some for setting the table. Had no problem keeping busy.. Fun store! Prices were not out of line.

8866,Nice and knowledgeable
8867,"Wonderful quick access, limited parking"
8868,"We just closed on a property with Mat Su Title and it was such a good experience! Skye was amazing! She made everything simple and was so nice! She also helped us on another property deed that First American Title totally screwed up and has been a huge headache for us, and she notarized some other miscellaneous documents for us, saving us a ton of time!  I highly recommend Mat Su Title!!!"
8869,"No pressure sales people, great value for the money."
8870,Moose's tooth is the best all the time!!!
8871,Great service
8872,"$10 Wash does great on my SUV, complete dirt free!!!üòéüòçüòò"
8873,Chicken nuggets and French fries.
8874,"Great Vets/assistants/staff in general. Boarding and grooming too, with self service pet bathing - dogs, pigs, cats, etc.  :)"
8875,Hard to get seating in the evenings if you have a laptop and need power.
8876,Really cheap and welcoming experience. Totally recommend it.
8877,"Gr8 for children B-Day parties. If there is  such a think as fast food....ready when you are pizzas, then this is your romeo."
8878,So good
8879,Great place to grab a bite
8880,A bit spend and was not told the meal was spicy so I couldn't eat but a few bites. However the service was great.
8881,Stay away! There only concern is money. They dont even care they served rotten chicken. It was green on inside.
8882,Great food atmosphere is awesome
8883,Awesome food!
8884,"I've only tried one kind of pizza so far, because it's too good! The salmon pizza was so tasty the first time I ordered it, that I had to get it again on my next visit. I'd like to branch out and try some of their other pies, but that smoky fish with that delicious dill sauce is too much to pass up.
I have at least done a little exploring of other sides of the menu, and I can happily report that FP's beer selection and salads are both on point. The kale quinoa salad is great, but my favorite is the spinach: the pecan-coated goat cheese in it is lovely and the beer-bacon dressing is outstanding. I also was really impressed by the canoli! This is an above-average pastry, light and lemon-inflected and really just marvelous.
The atmosphere is laid-back ‚Äì even when the kitchen is busy, the low-lighting and casually sleek surroundings feel grounded and calm. The service has been natural and attentive on my visits. I'd like to check out more of what the Ptarm has to offer, and definitely plan to be back!"
8885,I hit up Trez Bez whenever I need cheese curds or a Rockstar. They got cool food too. They wouldnt hire me as an employee (shame on them) but overall I like the local Kenai Trez Bez store.
8886,After seeing all the Salmon running in the Alaskan rivers and Seward I decided to order some Salmon and Sweat Potato Chips. The chips were no the best and tyhe Salmon tasted bad - it was very red coloured flesh. It was not a fillet cut but instead looked like it was torn from the fish. Cost was more than a good sit down restaraunt so not impressed. The cook serving there couldn't care less. Had a very bad attitude.
8887,They always have what you need and for a affordable price
8888,Lots of cute stuff! The employees working were very knowledgeable about the artist's who's work was available in the shop. It was a very enjoyable shopping experience and I was able to find some great gifts for friends!
8889,Best Buy is one of my favorite places to visit. I appreciate the employees asking if I need help with anything. Some of the older employees seemed a little grumpy walking around the store though.
8890,"This would be a great little park if it wasn't full of teenagers whose parents couldn't teach them more than four letter words to converse with.
My son loves the park, but I really don't need him hearing this nonsense every time he wants to ride his bike at the park."
8891,Ok
8892,excellent fries
8893,Easy ramp boarding no issues
8894,"Great setting on University Lake... The suites are clean and comfortable.. only one serving of caffeinated coffee in the room...the beds are good and firm, the pillows are very fluffy which flatten quickly...the shower leaked terribly, so be very careful on the tiles floor. The air within the hotel is uncomfortably dry, but is liveable for a short stay... All in all a good hotel with a good price."
8895,Great customer service
8896,Always excellent food here.-üòÅ
8897,Very friendly and filling burgers.
8898,Fresh and fast.
8899,"Very cool store! Friendly staff, great stuff to buy"
8900,The security at Carrs off Minnesota Drive is extremely rude and crude. I watched the security gaurd fallow a customer around harassing him the entire time. Telling him that he needs to make his choices quickly because the store is closing. Which I have never seen cars clothes besides on holidays. And he also told him that if he didn't hurry and make his selection and go to the front and check out that he would call Anchorage police on him. I didn't watch the customer go up to the front crash registers still been followed by the security guard pay for all of his groceries that he didn't even get very much time to pick out. And then while he was outside waiting for his ride to get there the security guard stood behind him the whole entire time telling him that he needs to get off of the property before Anchorage Police are called. I'm disgusted by that behavior that's so rude just because somebody looks homeless doesn't mean that they're a theif. That's a hate crime. Profiling. Security guards behaving like that should be fired or at least go to some classes on customer service and racism classes. I am appalled at how Carrs allows this to happen.
8901,Love the tea selection and there samples of hot beverages are so nice on cold days.
8902,Awais is s fantastic server
8903,Loved this place .always clean and the food and treats are amazing. Worth the price .
8904,"Nice local flair, nice staff, pizza and bar type foods is the main concentration but it's good especially the burgers."
8905,Such great pizza and beer
8906,"So, Simba is an old man that needed a shave, matted fur and very uncomfortable. He's much happier and struts, his stylish doü§ó"
8907,"They are faster and good job, but Rude. They will better if the Service was better."
8908,Is absolutely awesome for our family!
8909,Exceptional and host was informative
8910,Gorgeous place!
8911,"These people hurt my feelings by yelling at my friends and me after we seated ourselves. This only occurred, because there was an absence of a ""wait here to be seated"" sign. However, this has since been corrected and this point is moot."
8912,"WOW!  Lots of history on this beach and way scenic and windy. Take your camera, a warm coat, hat gloves and Dido too!  It's a doggies off leash paradise!"
8913,"We took our 2-year old Cockapoo to Tier one for a vaccine and check up yesterday, had an amazing, first-class experience from the moment we walked in. After he checked in, within a span of 30 min he saw 3 different professionals and the doctor was very generous with her time with us. Dog was happy to be there and no typical ‚Äúvet scares‚Äù like we imagined there would be. TIP- schedule your first appointment instead of doing a walk-in to save a good amount of $$"
8914,The best hot tom yum gai soup in town! Very comforting excellent service very clean
8915,Great 1 mile hike to a beautiful waterfall
8916,Kareoke KJ Josh and crew were awesome and the bartender was the bomb... enjoyed a night of pool and singing.
8917,"My son and I love it. We are more than satisfied with the prompt ""walk in"" service!"
8918,Wonderful place to celebrate a birthday
8919,Very helpful.
8920,Awesome donuts and good customer service.
8921,Great food and service!
8922,"Very sweet owner. She does more than just haircuts, shes a full on barber. She knows how to cut very thin hair and has never once left my husband with a bad cut."
8923,Love walmikes a trip to Alaska is not complete without stopping in
8924,"Great place! Service was excellent, and I can't even describe the food. Definitely have the seafood chowder! The hefe was good enough for two points, plus a growler. Price was very reasonable, too. Between me and my wife, had 3 hefes, the mushroom pizza, the sausage pizza and the chowder, and everything was excellent. Looking forward to our next trip to Anchorage to come back again!"
8925,"This place used to be my favorite, but until they change their business practices and treat their employees better I will stay away!"
8926,Would be 45 stars but..  the table top was coming off where we were sitting.
8927,Polite. Helpful. I will definitely use them next time always!
8928,As always a nice relaxing time.
8929,"Very helpful, awesome customer service and very friendly staff!"
8930,Lots of fun for my kids ages 6-10.
8931,Best sammich ever and Cinnabon on premise :D
8932,Loved the food was on point. Thanks for providing us with great food worth the drive across the valley just to pick up
8933,Amazing food
8934,Wait staff was very attentive. Food was up to usual standards.
8935,Always great
8936,"Staff was super nice! But for the price not even worth it!! The rooms where disgusting! The one room we had was a king bed. It smelled like cigarette smoke an my husband found a dirty rag that was left behind from the cleaning crew! We were moved to a new room with double beds. The smell was better but the room was still disgusting! There where cans left under the bed, and another dirty rag!! Also they didn't change out the pillow cases and blankets! Found hair inside the pillow cases an under the blanket!! So just in general the cleaning crew here really don't care and are beyond lazy!! Would not recommend this place!"
8937,Crab grilled cheese is the best thing ever
8938,Favorite sandwich place
8939,Knowledgeable part Dept. Friendly and helpful
8940,Cheapest prices around
8941,"Fun place to visit. Great selection of beers. My favorite was the Spruce Tip ale. The waitresses are very friendly and if you are around for a bit, they host tours of the backroom."
8942,"I want to love Chepos I just can't.  Before I became a vegetarian it was my favorite hands down.  I still come here for margaritas because they are the best!  Rice and beans are nit vegetarian, no big deal as that is usually the case at Mexican restaurants however at Chepos they still put rice in their ""vegetarian"" burrito which is disappointing (it is not listed in the ingredients on the menu either).  They fixed it and made me a new one but still.  If you are going to list vegetarian options on the menu please be sure the items actually are.  Our server was amazing"
8943,There prices are getting so high
8944,Affordable
8945,Get groceries and stuff here
8946,wonderful little gift shop!
8947,"A very good meal, and served in a quick manner. Nice atmosphere too."
8948,Got my order right the first time .
8949,One stop shopping! Prices are competitive along with the quality of their items
8950,"Very excellent experience at this Enterprise location. Employee picked me up, received very clean car and was gone in 10 mins! Great staff, very friendly!"
8951,Good for all
8952,"Beautiful hotel, atmospheric,  very nice large apartment like rooms, with kitchen, living room, large bedroom,  nice bathroom,  closet and a desk to work! Very clean, very friendly staff and centrally located. What else can you ask for??? We are coming back here. Highly recommend."
8953,Food is always good bad service
8954,Nice clean and informative on the history of the pipeline. Pleasant surroundings include a little stream with a couple little wooden bridges and well landscaped. Across the hwy you can pan for gold ! Took some great pics too.
8955,I wish another place has a play place.
8956,Not overly friendly staff but the sandwiches ate amazing.
8957,The service is terrible. They are rude and act like doing their job is such an inconvenience. As if you're putting them out.
8958,They are amazing.  Always friendly. And always give me what I want.
8959,Excellent!
8960,Nice lake to watch them fishing & large walk area
8961,"As always, great food and great service."
8962,Delicious!!
8963,The only place I will go!!
8964,"Takes forever, but great food to pick up"
8965,Theater was really nice but the new lion king movie was horrible they ruibed the movie no passion no laughter
8966,Small selection but tasty
8967,Pretty good food. The Pad Thai wasn't as good as I have had before
8968,Dirty and very rude.
8969,The food was ok. Nice small town feeling on the inside and the staff was friendly
8970,Worth it
8971,Clean and friendly staff. Plenty of games to play they have everything you would expect at this location.
8972,"Showers, laundromat used"
8973,The only liquor store in town.  Selection is limited.
8974,Pretty darn expensive. I would just got to the Orca if they are showing the same movie.
8975,Very understaffed when I was there.  Ended up leaving
8976,"Clean, brightly lit store with friendly staff. Rather expensive and limited selections."
8977,"Very unhappy with the professionalism of this company. I am a small business owner and I am disappointed at the lack of care this company has.
1. I was told I was next in line to get a tire changeover and waited 5+ hours to find out from the service men that they took care of two other customers on their way to me.

2. They incorrectly reported my vehicle mileage and caused the vehicle value to drop 80% and didn‚Äôt apologize.

Convenient service but terribly unprofessional."
8978,My favorite bowling alley by far
8979,"Old hotel, bad location."
8980,"I love Thai Kitchen, it is a staple of my local food favorites. I have been coming here since I was a child and always get excited when I know I am going to eat their delicious food. The pad Thai is some of my favorite in Anchorage, and the reasonably priced lunch special ($10.99) is fast and delicious. Highly recommended.

That said, it is almost always cold in this establishment and the decor has always been a little lame and hasnt been updated in 10+ years. But these are small qualms and would never keep me from a hearty recommendation."
8981,"Informative, you would learn something about salmons and the popular sport fishing practice in Alaska, the best part was to see the salmons in the creek."
8982,great place
8983,"Pancakes! Good service most the time and great meal, deals, and portions"
8984,Delicious!
8985,It's too bad I don't have a musical bone in my body. Otherwise I'd buy a guitar from These Folks. A Fabulous place for Guitars !!
8986,"Fantastic little gem of a ski area. Not usually too busy, run by volunteers and has a very local vibe instead of the big resort feel. Skiing is very good for a small mountain. Has two lifts and a tow rope and they take you right to the top. The rest is pretty much wide open with beautiful views of Arctic valley and jber"
8987,I love 1.50 scope day
8988,It was cold as hell in the theatre
8989,Nice outdoor area. Nice place to relax.
8990,Love it foods always amazing here
8991,"Good place to go with kids, maybe dog walking, or pokemon go, however not a huge number of independent attractions for young adults or teens otherwise."
8992,"Store is clean and always busy, just not a fan of their business model."
8993,"The dentist and hygienist were very professional and appropriate. Excellent care. The front desk staff was undertrained, ineffective with tasks and the office manager was a joke. If you can make it past the administrative staff and their incompetent manager, the medical staff and dental care is great."
8994,So much fun! Well run.
8995,Nice
8996,First time I went here I had an issue that other mechanics couldn't figure out. Searched on the Internet and found out others had the same issue. But when I brought it to Different Strokes they fixed it with no problems. Ron the owner runs a great shop. And Alex in front provides excellent customer service and is extremely knowledgeable. They definitely know their stuff.
8997,Good
8998,"We did not get to try a crepe as we did not have 45 minutes to wait. I imagine it is good based on the fact that so many people were there. I'd suggest the place get another cook or 2. When we were there, the one cook had a stack 25 or 30 orders to fill. And there was nothing between the patrons and the crepe irons. This seemed a bit dangerous (for kids) and possibly unsanitary as people could literally touch someone else's meal, or worse, sneeze or cough on it."
8999,Love this place & their food.
9000,some good food
9001,Friendly & helpful staff.
9002,They do the towing for AAA in my area
9003,"Spendy, but quality work.  They have always met the date of expected repair.   All their repairs have stood the test of time.  (Wife's shoulder bag, used like her life depended on it, Ski-skirt which I think she uses like a survival tool, tugging on the zippers and a child's Jacket (That in itself says it all).  Highly recommended."
9004,Love the peaceful walk and great scenery. Really peaceful and the owner is great.
9005,Loved it
9006,Deli rice
9007,Mall at Sears is a quick in and out!  Not the greatest selection but quick service.
9008,"Awesome park. The biggest park in a city on there planet. Over 400,000 acres."
9009,"Home run as always, both with service and food.. awesomeeee"
9010,Can be hard to find things.
9011,"Life saver! If the time could goes a little longer for drying bigger furrier dog like cookie. Plan ahead before starting anything helps. Heated, raised dog wash is gonna help in the winter but too bad there is not many of them in Anchorage."
9012,Great service
9013,"It's what you would expect,"
9014,What a great experience I had with Alaska Premier Auctions!!!! It was very smooth!! They went over and above to make sure that I would be able to get my  ‚Äúwinnings‚Äù. They were so good at communicating with me and so friendly even though they only made $20 off me. Thank you!!!!!
9015,I like this place because they have good waiters and waitresses there food tends to be a little bit on the high carbohydrate side of things and it's hard to find food for a person who is on a low-carb diet
9016,"Surprisingly nice place.  Good food, sweet service."
9017,Large variety of equipment!
9018,The new playground equipment was very nice. The grandkids had a lot of fun on it. To bad they're have been so disrespectful use of the equipment.
9019,I go for starbucks.
9020,Probably the 'nicest' dept store in ANC
9021,Fast food Mexican
9022,"The lay out of Coots is just a mess, but the artists and bands and comedians they book are worth putting up with it."
9023,Best bang for the buck lunch spot. Fresh tasty ample  portions for a take home dinner
9024,Ok. I went here on a date night. I understand many people love this place but I have to say no one puts candied jalapenos on nachos. I could not eat any of it after the 1st 6 bites. It was like the whole bottom of the nachos were soaked in candied jalapeno juice. I ended up getting very sick that night. Parking is terrible. Like you are meant to walk there.
9025,Meh...
9026,Great people and great place to eat
9027,AMAZING food and AMAZING people!
9028,So frickin good.. loaded potato with pork belly.
9029,Christmas party. Nice decore. Very good catering menu.
9030,Awesome ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Ö
9031,"Great staff,  great service and amazing food"
9032,Love this place!!!
9033,Its a Carrs.  Used to be better before Safeway took them over.
9034,Good COVID-19 practices in place !
9035,"Friendly service, if you need a new Toyota go see Kimbi Daniels and James Taylor"
9036,"Easy to get to, I  live minutes away"
9037,Its walmart. Good place to shop if you like depressingly low wages and Orwellian security.
9038,Fantastic! I had their stuffed French toast and it was amazing! The service was wonderful! If I'm in the area again I would totally go back.
9039,"I never had a bad experience here.  Plenty of beer selections on tap, cocktail menu and liquor.  The food is great, fresh and hot.  They have a good selection of burgers, sandwiches and appetizers.  Not your ordinary McDonald's, or your fancy Red Robin burger, just your blue collar, thick juicy mess on your face burger.  The prices are comparable to any other bar/restaurant.  The service is always professional and the place is clean.  It's alot better than what used to be in the same building.  I wish 907 Alehouse and Grill years of success."
9040,Nice place to ice skate in the winter.
9041,"The food was decent, but nothing really special. The sausage gravy wasn't bad, but tasted canned. The biscuits were home made, though, and the home fried potatoes had a good flavor to them. My hash browns, eggs and bacon were good, the eggs were cooked just right"
9042,Great service!
9043,Nice place for views and walking along the beach
9044,"Nice place, like a true general store."
9045,Great food and service
9046,Burrito bowls!!!!!!!!!
9047,Great food!
9048,We went it was about to close and the sushi was over. They made fresh sushi and served it at the table. Great service.
9049,The best thai food in anchorage!!!!!!
9050,Debbie and her staff always on the ball good job
9051,Always love going into home depot!
9052,Good food and great service
9053,Almost always have what I'm looking for and friendly help when I need it.
9054,Great beach to surf when the tide is up
9055,"2 stars for inconsistency. They have some really great wing sauce flavors but I'm almost never happy with how it turns out. The first few times I went the sauce was thick and ""saucy."" But the last few times I've been highly dissatisfied, it's like they are watering the sauce down with a whole bunch of oil or something. It's honestly quite gross. The wings come out in a puddle of oil or grease and there isn't much of any actual sauce. I keep going back because at one point the sauce was good. Especially the Lemongrass. It is WAY better than it sounds and is a life changing wing sauce.. When they do it right. Also very expensive for wings. And we have gone during published business hours but they weren't open."
9056,Wheres the meat
9057,Beautiful place good service wonderful food cant ask for much more
9058,could be better if bathroom is cleaner and newer
9059,Zack was great!
9060,"Delicious, fresh, absolutely perfect Alaska coffee!"
9061,Delicious pizza and fast delivery. Portions always huge and well worth the price.
9062,Expensive for a car wash.
9063,"Over rated. Over priced. They don't have a terrain park most of the season and when they do its the same old rails and boxes that they had 20 years ago. Where do all the profits go? Not back into the resort or improvements because they have no halfpipe. A weak park when they do have one, small jumps. Tracked out powder in 1day after a storm, very limited hiking and crap tree lines. Save you money and go hike in turnagain pass."
9064,Good music fun games. Love the staff
9065,"Great place for Gluten Free and Vegan. Lots of options, a little pricey though."
9066,Always fun to see the people of Walmart
9067,"Usually a long wait but the food is worth it, it‚Äôs nice getting to have Burger King here in Alaska it was the one place I feared I wouldn‚Äôt have moving up here! But the food is just like in Arkansas!"
9068,"Everyone (staff) is friendly and helpful, clean place. Price is very pricey during peak time. Signs in the resort can be misleading."
9069,Beautiful
9070,Phenomenal pizza! The amazing apricot is truly AMAZING! I'd also recommend the call of the wild... And just about anything else on the menu!
9071,"Beautiful inside, great sushi and fhe besf fried oreos!"
9072,Good food. They give you many options for different BBQ sauces. Decent prices and A  variety Of sides.
9073,"Pizza was cold (not even sure how considering they are in an insulated bag), and they forgot the hot sauce. Also took a ridiculous amount of time to get here and I'm around the corner."
9074,Talked to me like I was a child assumed my age and asked me to leave the 21 older section
9075,"It's McDonald's...nothing memorable about this one, one way or the other. Nothing great, nothing terrible either. Seems clean and friendly."
9076,Meh
9077,Good place
9078,This is a fun place! Make sure you stop at the Crab House and get a bloody Mary!
9079,Pizza is always really good
9080,"Sesame chicken turned out to be some chicken strips in noodle salad, I didn't like any of the food we got or the service, not interested in going back"
9081,Attentive staff! Delicious carne asada! My family feels so comfortable at Los Arcos and nobody's sad about terrific Mexican food.
9082,It appears that they're rearranging the layout or configuration of their store displays in certain areas. Also noticed alot of items were in disarray or sold out. Otherwise the staff was helpful and pleasant.
9083,"It‚Äôs ok pizza for a chain store, it‚Äôs convenient inside Walmart and of course the Eagle River Walmart is one of the easiest Walmart‚Äôs to get in and out of with plenty of parking. They also deliver and you can order on line. If you‚Äôre not in the mood to cook after a long day at work, you can order on line before you leave work and it should be ready about the time you get to Eagle River."
9084,Nice selection of groceries and other outdoor equipment.
9085,Lovely kids program and main service. A little bit high on decibels for my ears. Lovely all the same.
9086,Great new toys for kids
9087,Great place for the kids to wear themselves out.  Which makes me a happy parent/customer.
9088,Remote and Peaceful. Port Alsworth is a true Alaskan village. Everyone is friendly and the scenery is as good as it gets.
9089,Timely and to the point
9090,"Great as a playground picnic and such, but the dog park not so much, too many dogs at one time, my dog caught kennel cough twice, will not take my dog to the dog park area again."
9091,Always costs me at costco. But as i break all the bulk produce and product down. It always saves me..ps my granddaughter breaks it all down for me as to cost per item..i save alot more this way.
9092,Good place to get Canadian goose outer where and gear.
9093,"Its a Subway.  Clean, almost friendly staff.  Fresh items are sparse"
9094,The owner was able to come up with a fix for my cell phones missing power button and in the process restore my 4G connection. Thank you for helping get this busy lady back on track!
9095,There's a lake right next door so that's fun
9096,"Generous, fresh, made just for you portions. Get there early."
9097,Great and helpful customer service.
9098,Pretty good experiences here
9099,Nice staff. Wonderful service.
9100,I've heard really good things about the place or is there a very friendly I hope they have a good year. they're located at the end of Hanson Street
9101,"Very small mall with nothing in it. We bring our truck here to Sears for an oil change. Their prices are high so I always get a coupon off the internet. Make sure they code your coupon right. They will try and charge you for the highest oil change. Also, no restaurants around either so be prepared to starve."
9102,"Good food and service, morning rush can be a waiting game. Can't expect much else from the best sandwiches in Fairbanks."
9103,Great reindeer sausage pinwheels. Got bread to go enjoyed it all week!
9104,"I have given the Mall a low grade due to the extreme difficulty going to and from the Mall. Ordinarily the mall is less than 10 minutes from where I live, however, right now there is Major Construction over the Glenn Highway so getting into and out of the mall area is very very problematic. Once that's finished, sometime next year, then access will be a breeze and the mall will really start flourishing"
9105,Can find some items there that you can't find at Walmart
9106,We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Marie was our server and she was awesome. She's on the ball. Food was amazing. My husband had the Halibut and fries. I had the chicken cobb salad which was huge and oh so delicious. We had the pretzel and Brussel sprouts for appetizers. The pretzel was huge and the sprouts were to die for. We highly recommend this place.
9107,Very long wait but i got a amazing haircut all my lines are even and i look good. If you plan to go i recommend you make a apointment online so you don't have to wait so long.
9108,"Great icecream! But I also go their to tip the employees. Those girls are always patient, hard working, and friendly. Fabulous job hiring!!"
9109,"Beware, they started charging more if you use a credit card and they don't tell you that."
9110,"Its a fairly quiet court, but needs some improvements in more than one area!"
9111,Best stop for all Warhammer products!
9112,"Amazing food, fantastic atmosphere and service. A must breakfast stop. üòã"
9113,"Always good pizza. Never a bad time. But there are peak hours where the line is ""down the street"""
9114,Lots of fun. Run into lots ppl from home even i didnt bingo. FUN.
9115,Came in a bit under dressed and they made me feel like it. Food was overpriced and not that great. I can think of half a dozen places in walking distance that are MUCH better.
9116,"It was so so for sushi, good prices, but not like awesome flavor, I was let down."
9117,"Entrees were pricy, but huge.  Should have shared them.  Clam chowder and sourdough bread was worth the trip."
9118,Has what you need
9119,Generally positive experience.
9120,Food was amazing and staff
9121,The sun made fair going nice.
9122,"My rating here used to be 5 stars as my husband and I would love to have steak dinner dates at Club Paris often.

On Thursday, July 16, 2020 we had just received our food and a tall Caucasian gentleman (who I‚Äôm assuming is either the manager or owner of the place) left from behind the bar area and approached and sat down with some newly arrived guests at the table behind us and greeting them as they were long time friends.  Usually this would be great but by doing so he violated the social distancing rule as he was now a foot away from us sitting behind me.  We were happy to not worry about him and enjoy our meal but his friends started talking extremely loud with him so that the booth in front of us could also easily hear the conversation.

The first thing his friends asked him was what he thought about the newly mandated covid rules to which he replied he didn't plan on complying with them because he talked to his staff and they all felt safe. Afterwards they continued to yell and be completely disrespectful to the other guests as they cussed out our Mayor and the policies he implemented to keep Anchorage safe.

We had maybe taken 3 bites each of steak before we couldn't deal with the vulgarity, rudeness and yelling so we asked for our food to be boxed and the check and left. I feel bad for the other guests and the wait staff as besides that sour experience we enjoyed the few bites of food we had. Sadly  we probably won't be coming back and I feel obligated to lower my review and tell my friends and all guests to visit other places around town."
9123,"Disappointed with the smokehouse combo meal, that was not a brisket portion, hardly two bites, very dry. Not certain what they were doing with the corn, it was boiled most likely and put briefly on the grill, soggy and the sauce and cilantro was a bit much. Overall food tasted like it was done the day before. Appetizer and drinks were the best part of the meal, which is sad. Will not be back. Server was good but unresponsive to our complaint on the food."
9124,Expensive. They are open extended hours.
9125,The one in Palmer is a new Windy's.
9126,Found what i needed. Great selection. Friendly staff.
9127,Beautiful wildlife. Bring camera that can zoom and bear repellent.
9128,"This is the number one spot for any fisherman on the peninsula. Go here, spend too much money, and remember you needed that one odd screw or nut on your way out."
9129,Okay
9130,"Beautiful setting, great service"
9131,"Good hotel for a short stop in Anchorage. Had 2 washers but one was busted and would fill eith water but not spin. The guy who drives to the train in the morning is great. They have an on site Cafe. Close enough to walk to several restaurants. Kind of an edgy part of town and some homeless and druggees around, but not nearly as many as San Francisco or Sacramento. The front desk lady was the manager and was excellent."
9132,Overwhelming
9133,Fantastic drinks!
9134,"Dated, furniture is a little beat up, but can't beat it for the price."
9135,Great service
9136,"Always great for, people working there are always nice too. Delivery is quick."
9137,"Always great food and top notch service (in Fairbanks, fast food service matters). Just wish it wasn't so expensive"
9138,Its costco and as such will be busy but offers whats needed
9139,Great parking lot to ride my bike in circles!!!!???
9140,"Quick service, polite staff, all around positive experience."
9141,"Many cabins out of order. Long cues.
No water tap outside to allow us to wash a carpet or a cloth."
9142,"Best mac n cheese ive ever had, an bomb raspberry hot chocolate"
9143,Very informative about the park
9144,Love their food and their milkshakes!!!
9145,Costco.
9146,Pricey.
9147,"Great selection and prices were good. I got Great service from Jose, he was very knowledgeable. I will be making this my new meat destination."
9148,"i like there wings ,, and thats all that matters , each person has got to find what they like in town and support that business.   we live in alaska!!! hello !!! , we cant get roscos chicken and waffles ,, or chruches chicken.."
9149,Top notch food and service.
9150,"Always a good experience. Very nice employees.

Edit: I still love the convenience of this place being so close to my work and the people are great. Just a little bit frustrating that I take a 30 min break and head there in less than a minute for a coffee and wait in line for 15 to 20 minutes almost every time. If you're in a time crunch pre order and go inside."
9151,Helpful and had a great beard
9152,"Two words: Country Benny.
For those who need more words: I love restaurants with a homespun vibe and a great sense of humor. This one has both. Take the time to read all the signs on the wall to keep you grinning while you wait for your food. Heck, just read the menu all the way through for a ton of great, snarky menu humor. Servers are kind and they keep that coffee flowing! What more can you want on a cold Alaskan morning?"
9153,best view there is
9154,Best place to smoke and watch the planes take off
9155,"First how do u (no offence to the gentleman working the phone) have someone whom is taking 1000's of dollars, no matter what form it may take, not be able to count.  They even told me the didnt know math very well.  How did he get the job?  And to get anything accomplished thru them. Forget about it.   There has been one helpful lady that works there.  She is very nice and helpful.  Hope you get her when u call because if its anyone else should just hang up."
9156,Good people funny idiot theft board
9157,Got some real help but have constant internet problems all over town and at home!
9158,Where I go when I can't find things elsewhere!
9159,This is my favorite pizza place in town which is a controversial statement in Anchorage. People have serious feelings about pizza in this town. The main reason I love this place is that it's made in a traditional Italian style. There's nothing wrong with crazy toppings but this is what you would get in Naples and its delicious!
9160,Great food!
9161,"Great views, scenic place."
9162,"(Translated by Google) You have to wait 20 minutes

9163,Good day to have a frappuccino
9164,I love muldoon pizza because it's the best in town and they're wonderful people that work there.
9165,"What is wrong with you people with the negative feedback? This restaurant is the absolute BEST in Anchorage and the bar cannot be messed with. I strongly urge those people that had a not so great experience to give it another go..... Or don't, so I can get in easier. The only thing that upsets me is that more and more people are finding out about my little gem in Spenard.... Damn you social media....Damn you."
9166,Good food.
9167,"Great service,  attentive staff. I even got a call a few days later to make sure my dog was fine. Even in times of covid,  the attention and expertise was exceptional."
9168,Carlson Park is a small park tucked away in a residential neighborhood in the middle of town. It's one of those places you don't know exists until you either stumble upon it or look for something like it. It was quite and playground equipment for the kids to entertain themselves.
9169,Pretty view
9170,"My experience at that place wasn't good, is like the lowest place I been, and specially the person maria Kennedy that need to have more knowledge about how treat people.also they overcharge me and never apologize for that. Sad they lie about be good."
9171,"Take it or leave it, the only real 'mall' in town."
9172,Customer service is absolutely horrible
9173,Better than burger King on northern lights
9174,Great service
9175,"Irish charming owner delivering delicious food, drinks, and service.  And biodegradable to go packages  :)"
9176,Good prices
9177,"A Fabulous place to walk the pier, watch for marine life and eagles and best of all, during the summer months, the yachts that dock here are truly spectacular!"
9178,This store is wonderful. A break from the big box stores. They carry things for Alaska
9179,Wildmans is a staple for large soft-serve waffle cones to make road trips to and from the Peninsula more enjoyable. Wildmans is also a valuable resupply stop for extending camping trips in and around Cooper Landing.
9180,"eh, service was alright. the food was alright. I did not get the fried chicken and I think that may have been my problem. Tennessee chicken is whack. buffalo chicken was good. I'll go back to get the right thing."
9181,"Great vibe! Great food! Great people! Freshly brew beer. Love that deep fried calamari ! We park our RV at the camp site next to the restaurant! Love it!

Love the band that was playing too!
Definitely a 5 stars experience!"
9182,"Nice place!  A very beautiful location with warm showers, and a nice place for kids to run around."
9183,Very fresh and tasty
9184,Great place to observe the birds and take the kids for a walk
9185,"Great food. We had crab cakes, french onion soup, caprese, and fettuccine. All tasted fantastic. Friendly staff too. I didn't drink alcohol tonight, but the raspberry lemonade was good too.

On my subsequent visit: Filet mignon was fantastic! I tried a couple different wines and their menu was pretty accurate in its description, both tasted great. Also had the cheese platter and it was much better than the platter at the Crow's Nest. My only complaint was the goat cheese on the pizza we ordered. Goat cheese should not be on pizza."
9186,"Heather needs to work on her interpersonal skills.. even bad service can turn good if it's done with a smile and a little conversation, c'mon now."
9187,Awesome ice cream....worth the long wait
9188,Always a Great Breakfast!
9189,The food and service is always the best

9204,Beautiful place!
9205,Is fair
9206,Local hand crafted ciders. Friendly staff. These guys are doing it right. Food trucks often park here too.
9207,Awesome summer fun!
9208,"Good food, over priced."
9209,By far the best in town! The salsa is to die for and so is the Carne Asada tacos!
9210,"I love Blockbuster!! To either rent a movie, buy a few on sale or some retro toys and candy that you just can't get anywhere else! ‚ù§ Become a member for even better deals"
9211,Best beef tongue in America!!!
9212,Great selection at a wide range of prices. Great to catch them during a sale.
9213,"If you take time to look, there's great stuff!!"
9214,Beautiful place.
9215,"Avoid this place around 6pm if you don't wanna wait forever in line!! Otherwise very nice store, clean and friendly place... Carries a few local items and health stuff... This place beats Fred Meyer any day of the week."
9216,"This is a fantastic store. I have always loved the catalog, now I  can just shop and go. Woo hoo!"
9217,Several locations in my area
9218,Great wash!
9219,"I stayed there over Christmas 2015 while visiting family.  The hotel is ok but pretty dated.  The room that I was in was clean but had things like a broken thermostat, dead plug in, etc.  They could spend some more time on maintenance.  Also the complementary breakfast was not very good and they are extremely rude about the vouchers for the food."
9220,I like PT where was remolded lately.
9221,"Nice place , decent prices !!  The people were very nice !!"
9222,The McChicken is McLife.
9223,Nothing new. Good deals on old stuff tho
9224,Really nice staff. Fast service and of course who can resist the chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy? Not me!
9225,A favorite <3
9226,Good food and nice cold beer!!!
9227,"Normal Subway, except the staff. The staff here was GREAT.  I wish I could remember the teens that were helping me, but they were great."
9228,Good food. Room temperature rice was disappointing.
9229,"Great Service, manager made up for a minor issue, food was excellent, atmosphere very lively"
9230,I love this place there is knowledgeable staff that you can ask for help
9231,Fast service and variety of seating
9232,"Rooms not bad... Great people, fun pool tournament on Thursday's."
9233,Love taking the kids out here <3
9234,Super nice staff! Thanks for the great service!
9235,"This sonic needs to get it together... I don‚Äôt know what it is, but their system of how they do business is terrible. There is not reason why I should wait 45 minutes for a kids meal and 2 drinks."
9236,Once in a great while when I'm not the designated driver this is where I like to go. People are great and it has a laid back atmosphere.  There is no other bar in town that I would rather go to period.
9237,"Nice, clean room. Delicious food at the restaurant. Gave 4 stars due to a man being passed out outside a room down from mine."
9238,"How have I never heard of this place?! Had it last week for the first time. Was very impressed. Ordered again this week, and AGAIN- SUPER IMPRESSED!!! We've had the pizza, two types of the calzones, gyro, and spaghetti & meatballs. HUGE HUGE portions. Fresh food. My favorite ranch dressing in town!"
9239,The only place that carries lights for our dragons. So thank you!!
9240,You can get lost for days. Awesome places to see
9241,I. Love. Sakura! Who are we kidding? The prices are outrageously expensive. But the food is SO good! I like spicy sushi rolls so I always get the Hot Night Roll. I also like the Jessica Roll. My boyfriend always gets the Monkey Brains and Las Vegas Roll. The price of a roll is about $15-17 so do the math. The rolls I got would be fairly good sized (not too small) and would be about 6-8 bites. I've tried sushi elsewhere and haven't found anything I like as much as Sakura.
9242,Standing where you can't stand in the summer.
9243,It's fine nothing special.  Serve Hawaiian food.
9244,"Being the only hobby shop in an area that is this size, one would think that the customer service would be terrible. Where else can people go to get things done, no where. This is the only place around for your hobby enthusiasts. That being said, the customer service here is top notch. You may find yourself waiting a few minutes for help, but that goes without saying. It gets busy here. The staff is attentive and welcomes you in the door. On a cold day, I took my son there to get some parts and one of the staff members brought this homeless man in and gave him something hot to drink and a place to sit out of the cold. That is above and beyond."
9245,"Clean campground next to river. Great for viewing moose, Eagles and many other birds."
9246,"OPA has only provided wonderful experiences for me. All the staff and doctors I've interacted with are knowledgeable and friendly. The most recent experience I felt was the best so far because of the new telemedicine option for returning patients during this time of Covid19. It saved me a whole day and the cost of a plane ticket since I live quite a distance away. They confirmed my appointment a couple of days in advance and explained how the telemedicine experience would be. On the day of the appointment they contacted me ahead of time and set me up with video conferencing that worked out really well.

I must also mention that Brittany Sedlacek who I was seeing was super friendly and it was obvious she cared about my condition. She is a great person to work with."
9247,Enjoyed the white chocolate breve with a compforting smile and meanial conversation as i wait.
9248,There are some great shops and restaurants.
9249,"It's a Walmart, what else is there to say?"
9250,Great selection of vitamins and herbal supplements.
9251,"Great food all around awesome environment and staff just expect to pay more than fast food, even though it is fast!"
9252,"It's Walmart, buttt they have great steaks"
9253,"Tasty food, good service in a relaxed atmosphere."
9254,"Solid very selection and excellent burgers make this Ale House am excellent find, though bring a DD as the location of best reached by car. Had a burger with the best side salad I ever had at a bar. A fun local band had solid sound mixing which meant we could enjoy them and talk to friends. Try the 907 tea if your not planning on driving."
9255,"Breathtaking beauty. Denali wasn't out during our all-day bus tour of the park, but we had a great view of it on the train ride going home."
9256,"Had a nice time bowling. The only issue was I had made a reservation for my sons birthday and they call me three hours beforehand and cancel because they had leagues, not like they didn‚Äôt know that when they had made the reservation in the first place. So we had to completely re-plan his birthday on his birthday literally three hours before it was his party time ü•≥. Not very happy about that but went the next day because bowling was already promised and had fun. There was a group of teenagers in the lane next to us seriously cussing every few seconds like it made them look cool. Everyone including the staff could hear them but never said anything, about half an hour of having them cursing loudly In front of my 10 year old son I finally turned to them and politely asked them to stop . Zero issues after that . Was fun"
9257,Gave us the wrong dipping sauce.  Everything else was great.
9258,Great recreational park. Definitely come here if you are looking to have some fun!
9259,Good food.
9260,Super store. Very large. Brand new.
9261,The prices are always great and the staff are super helpful.
9262,Delicious
9263,Pretty big mall but lacks the stores I like.
9264,Always reliable and affordable
9265,Awesome is amazing is fun is cool is coolio
9266,First class facility. I  highly recommend.
9267,"Food tastes fine but, the quality of service is pretty mediocre. The wait times are always poor to very bad. The portions have gotten really bad last few months. I mean a crunchy taco with maybe a tablespoon of meat and barely any lettuce or tomato has become standard. The other menu items suffer from the same portioning problem."
9268,"Firecracker shrimp. 4! in a pile of mayo. Not spicy and cold. Bartender never checked on us. 17 dollars. No smiles on the staff's faces.
No resemblance to the Healy store. üò¢"
9269,Burgers and Steak Fries were awesome.
9270,Easy hike
9271,"They do a good job, but stock is limited, and they are out of 555 and other products very frequently. I also went in during their buy one get one free day, and they forgot to tell me about it. And then the didn't honor the deal when they were told about it."
9272,My Favorite
9273,Awesome. Delicious. Fun.
9274,Good consistent food.
9275,I work at Garrett's tesoro and some times I order food from this place the food is great and so is the prices  And the owner is a great person I got a chance to meet him very friendly
9276,Good burgers
9277,My go to for family gifts during the holidays! I was still ordering from here while living in WA state for 10 years.
9278,Staff was awesome. Seating for 2 was quick. Food came out fast and hot. Drink menu was large. Food however was missing alot of flavor. Unsure if I would go back again.
9279,"Wish I could give 0 stars! I have lived in the valley for 12 years, I love BK food, & unfortunately we only have one location, in Wasilla. There is something SERIOUSLY wrong with the management/ownership of this particular BK. My family has LITERALLY NEVER had a good experience at the Wasilla, Ak location. The staff is RUDE & DISORGANIZED. I PAY for cheese & bacon on my burger, and 99% of the time have to go back & ask them to actually put the cheese & bacon on that I paid for.  Regularly get raw egg on the breakfast sandwich, & old stale hash browns. The building itself is on its last leg & should probably be torn down. If you love BK like I do, do yourself a favor & drive the 40 miles to Anchorage..."
9280,Best bar in Eagle River!!! Lol
9281,Quick and easy and food is good. Friendly service.
9282,Service was poor.  Cod was not good and was soggy.  Clam chowder was good.
9283,Excellent food & service
9284,"I love home Depot they have lots of stuff you wouldn't even expect to be there. The only bad thing I would say is that they don't have some of the things they have in lower 48.l and some of the stuff online they won't ship to Alaska for even store pickup. That being said, I still love it and will continue to shop here they do still have some great stuff"
9285,"Well, it's Wal-Mart."
9286,No longer accepts competitor coupons.  Will buy from online stores from now on.
9287,5 stars say no more.
9288,The rooms are not open concept but are very comfortable and have everything you would need.
9289,Small line but very fast service
9290,"Great. This is my favorite  Walmart store located in Dimond area in Anchorage.  Clean , the clearance is the best besides their low prices ,friendly staff (most of the time.  It feels as if all stores are on the edge people because of theives)."
9291,Excellent Sevice & Great Food!
9292,This place is great!
9293,Great seafood department
9294,Best breakfast in town
9295,"We had a wonderful experience at Bear Paw. The atmosphere was comfortable. Our waitress was kind, attentive and helpful. Food was delicious. Especially the corn fritters and fries. Lots of bar drink options. Looking forward to visiting again. Family Friendly. Lots of space tonsorial distance. Masks were worn by waitresses the whole time. üêª"
9296,It is very close to my house that matters to me there's never a wait and no one bothers me
9297,"These guys are awesome. Walked in and immediately love the atmosphere. Drinks were on the low side for town, and their hot sandwiches are awesome"
9298,"Extremely nice guys. Very helpful & informative, but not pushy. Great space & layout. Plenty of room to look around, Great Deals, & Lots of Product choices!"
9299,"Denali has something for everyone. Free shuttles for the first twelve miles of the park (you can also buy tickets to tour buses for areas of the park not available to visitors' vehicles). There are dog sled presentations a few times a day, a well planned system of trails (the Savage Alpine Trail allows a good view of Denali [about 80 miles away] on a clear day, but it is fairly strenuous: 1-3 hours depending on your pace climbing to the summit). Mountain Vista Trail is incredibly easy and can offer a view of Denali. During our time in Alaska, we've noticed the best time to see moose is around 8-10 in the evening (August) and this held true in Denali."
9300,Knowledgeable staff and great service and selection
9301,I've been there several times and had complications every time. Staff was always there to offer knowledge and assistance any time it was needed!!
9302,"Very small venue but a great opportunity to get fairly up close and personal to 4 brown bears and 2 black bears. This is a sanctuary so there are plenty of photo opportunities. It is a place where the bears are well taken care of and the caretakers have a lot of information not only about the resident bears but bears in general. There are bald eagles everywhere! It is a little out of the way, but well worth the drive to see these beautiful creatures."
9303,The nachos and the calamari are probably the best in town. Bomb!
9304,Got the hammer time crab was over cooked and dried out.
9305,"Excellent place to walk around and look at all the old buildings. Excellent little shops and eateries. Most of all, totally excellent for children."
9306,I had what might have been the best burger in Anchorage! I can't wait to take my wife there and try something else.
9307,"What can I say about IHOP, I love pancakes & they were delicious. Bacon was a bit crispy but I forgot to order it on the limp side. Coffee was tasty for once. Thumbs up"
9308,They are always very kind & gentle with my kids.  My kids love it!
9309,Great
9310,A waste of time and money
9311,Professional services really helpfully
9312,Always good food
9313,Love this place staff here are awesome :-)
9314,It was good
9315,Customer service was exceptional! Super helpful and friendly. Product was a little pricy and very filling. Absolutely delicious selection.
9316,Hole in the wall brewery and tasting room. They have flights!
9317,Don't get me started...
9318,My husband and I love coming here. The food is wonderful
9319,The big Dance floor is awesome
9320,"Pretty decent alaskan shop for tourist check it out and see everything they have to offer, all of 4th Ave is a trap üòâ"
9321,"Excellent food,  good and fast service.  Their Thai tea and Pad Thai was great."
9322,Always a good idea to make a quick trip here to check out the shirts
9323,"Great food, not the most cleanliness"
9324,"Carrie Underwood concert 2016, view from second row on bleachers, not that comfortable but pretty good view!"
9325,Great food and service
9326,Good food and great service
9327,The  people at the Jewel Lake location are always friendly
9328,"Prompt, professional, Courteous! I called the second I got a rock chip the day before Thanksgiving and they got me in immediately and I had my windshield sealed, paid for by my insurance, and ready to go within 30 mins. I've been coming here for over 20 years now and have literally never had a less than perfect experience. Thanks Novus."
9329,Love old navy but not untill recently did they have clothes that I would wear.
9330,AWESOME AS ALWAYS!!! GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE!!! üòÉ üòÉ üòÉ
9331,"Not a bad wait to get processed, the staff are professional and courteous. Better than benning!"
9332,"That's right , rewards member ü§£ this place is my go to , the staff is always helpful and always happy! For me thats a plus . Nobody like attitude lol"
9333,Spicy..... not bad
9334,Good coffee and breakfast burrito
9335,Beautiful store great prices....awesome costumer service
9336,"Animals were beautiful, hard to catch them all awake though"
9337,"Ehhhh it was your typical fair, just shrunken down. The midway was horribly expensive."
9338,Good food and service depending on the day
9339,Great food and nice people
9340,Wonderful experience
9341,"The food is amazing , pricey but worth it 100%."
9342,"I stop at this location often when I'm in the area. Convenient, clean, and friendly with lots of options. Gas prices are comparable to Anchorage, however be forewarned as a store the traffic volume is high... Be prepared to wait in line."
9343,"Good food, bit pricey. Service was pretty on point. Handling the pandemic marginally better than most of the rest of anchorage it seems like."
9344,"It's been there forever, it would be sad to see it go away. Check out the coffee shop there. Very nice people!!"
9345,NICE
9346,Best spot for vapes. Owner is very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Best prices also. This is the only smoke shop I go to now. Six stars! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
9347,"The food was very delicious,  approachable staff, and classy place..."
9348,"McDonald's has gotten rather good at the uniformity of their customer service and food delivery. This location doesn't let you down. Typical McDonald's food, with a typical presentation. That's not a bad thing, McDonald's prides themselves on their ability to deliver relatively the same experience at every location! I am very content about the quality of service at this location."
9349,They have all equipment for exercising and great customer support
9350,"I sleep well, and the rooms are clean. When I forgot stuff in the room it was saved for me. The attached bar and restraint serve great food. Both have a very cool view of the Boat Harbor. Service is usually fast and my tea glass has never gone dry. It definitely is our first choice."
9351,Excellent customer service and work. Very organized as well. Its amazing they tell you when they want you there and when it will be ready.
9352,Spices and teas galore! They also have a tea cafe where you can get a cuppa on the go. Friendly staff make this place to go for all your tea needs.
9353,"Great little shop, great prices, nice employees! Support local businesses!"
9354,Food poison
9355,Good work
9356,"This is one of my favorite spots to eat in town. Small cozy atmosphere with friendly wait staff, they have excellent food and offer beers. It's my opinion that they have the best quiche in Anchorage. They also are reasonably priced and you can get a good meal for about 15 dollars."
9357,"We absolutely love Domino's Pizza and our local team in Eagle River, AK. represent the corporation extremely well. Always delicious food, friendly faces and a pride in service that's not easily matched.

Well done..."
9358,Great place to work. Fun environment. Great staff.
9359,Love all the crafts
9360,"We only stopped for a potty break, but there was porta potties available. Very happy to find those. Lol"
9361,Another big box store
9362,The service was great (even for pickup)! We had D12 and everything was beyond delicious. I got this for my mom for a late night snack and even ate half it. This place is great and we will definitely be regulars when were in town.
9363,love the beef and cheddar
9364,Had a great experience with Culi.  One of the best.
9365,"Big fan of Duluth for several years now and couldn't be more excited to see a brick and mortar storefront right here in Anchorage!  Great selection of what their catalog and online store covers.  They have a great lounge area for you to sit down, relax and grab a cup of coffee - Ron Swanson would be proud.

Lots of staff on hand for any questions as well as a clearance room.  And don't worry - there are sales and deals to be had even on day one.

If you are new to Duluth - they make solid, easy fitting, long lasting clothes that you will get maximum mileage out of.  And their Buck Naked underwear and Ballroom jeans are stuff of legends.  Legends."
9366,Very good selection and great price.
9367,Warm beer and bitter burger's. Others in group had good seafood.
9368,"Bought a Groupon, unfortunately for 3 facials. The place is run and disgusting. They don't even try to treat you well as a customer. The secretary (?) Was sitting in a chair texting when I walked in and only looked up for a split second and asked what I needed. ""i have an appt for x time for a facial with Ashley"" (heads up, the Groupon says Ashley... Pretty sure she doesn't work there, it was DeAnn who did mine... And had cancelled on me prior). The facial room looks like a cluttered dorm that hasn't been cleaned in months. She legit put some steam on my face, then slapped on a sheet mask (ya know, the ones you can get for a buck at Walmart, target, etc), left the room for about twenty minutes, came back, rubbed some lotion on and that was it.
I could've given myself a much more peaceful and moisturizing procedure at home. I've gotten facials for YEARS and being a traveling nurse, I've had to change spas regularly. I have never had one so horrible. I'm not even sure she was licensed.
Plus, the sign on the wall basically demanding tips is insulting, and so ridden with grammatical and spelling mistakes.
I wrote a review on Groupon, as well. I truly hope no one goes in there expecting a clean, calm or relaxing experience.
I can only imagine the 5 star reviews are from employees and friends. This place is AWFUL"
9369,Terrible place to deal with. Didn't even know about this debt until after it was with Cornerstone (helps crooks). It was an oversight with GCI (crooks) on my final bill when I moved out of state and without warning Cornerstone immediately put it on my credit report.
9370,"Small wings, mediocre sauce, stoned delivery driver....not a bad wing spot. üëçüëçüëç"
9371,Fishing is ok.
9372,Awesome service quick efficient best in town!!!
9373,Fantastic food. The bartender was awesome and made sure we always had a beer in front of us. I'll definitely be back!
9374,for GOOD service sit in the BAR.  If you want terrible to mediocre service sit in the other part.   Food is not bad.  Pizza is good.  Enjoy eating there now I know where to sit to get good service.   Takeout can be hit or miss.
9375,Remodel was good. Clean and lit well inside. A huge improvement from before. Glad to see The Dome back up and functional
9376,Typical mall.  Nothing fancy about it.
9377,"a bit pricey, but a must see if your in Juneau. The experience alone is worth the visit. One of the more interesting Bars In America"
9378,Excellent customer service
9379,Best place to buy your liquor
9380,"Dollar bowling Sunday nights is a killer deal, with a fun crew of regulars happy to offer useful tips (mad shout out to Monty especially). Better than expected chicken wings, have always had good service at the bar, and though I've occasionally gotten a touchy ball-return machine, tend to have a very solid bowling experience. My preferred lanes in Anchorage. Beer list is better at Taku Lanes in Juneau though :D"
9381,Asiago rustic bread is amazing! It's like pesto bread but better!  I love the free samplings of bread and the cheerful staff as soon as you walk in. We go here about every two months or so and have always had good service and food.
9382,Very scenic area
9383,"Great variety of equipment,  ATV selection,  & customer service."
9384,Stopped by on black Friday since it was convenient for us and had a enjoyable time. Our waitress Renee was fantastic. She made the average dinner out at a chain restaurant amazing. We will be back sooner than later because of the experience.
9385,"Provides convenient service for South Douglas residents, beach goers and fueling the boat for South Douglas fishing departures."

9398,Bathroom
9399,"Good service,"
9400,"Nothing overly fancy, just good, filling, tasty food."
9401,"Love the food! There was ample portions, as well as fresh food. It was very obviously cooked to order. Plenty of ease of access for handicap parking and dining. Excellent job of getting the food cooked fast so we could eat it there. We were not waiting long and made it back to work in time, to not be late. I will definitely be enjoying thier cooking again!"
9402,I would give them 5 stars but it seems they don't carry Mongolian beef which is my favorite but other than that been pleased each time I'm there.
9403,"Great food, not crowded at dinner time."
9404,Warm and welcoming vibes paired with great food. Arguably the best pok√© in town!
9405,Food tastes good but the lobby could use some upgrading and cleaning of counters more often.
9406,"I feel very fortunate to have found Dr. Robert Allen at Alaska Medical Specialties. edit: They also have a great ND (Naturopathic Doctor) named Markian Babij, that helps Dr Allen with my case. If you need a urologist, or have oncological concerns, AMS is certainly worth checking out."
9407,"Food was fast but cold, hashbrowns soggy, veggies not caramelized enough. Eggs over cooked."
9408,If you haven't been you need to.  They make fantastic sandwiches on in house made bread.  They make scrumptious pastries and huge cinnamon rolls.
9409,Customer service is not their priority.

9415,There really need to be more proactive to ice control in the five hours I was there I watched 3 people hit pretty hard from falling on the ice.
9416,Great food. Family owned so they treat everyone like family. Great niche for group use.
9417,"Always a good choice, we don't have this up north"
9418,"Hay if your in the area and your shopping for a vehicle stop in look around talk to the staff ask questions lots of questions if you find your dream ride look it over top to bottom under the hood in the fender wells, check the oil level and color check the coolant, brake fluid color and level, and battery connections. If you don't know how YouTube it and don't right! If anything is out of place or off walk away! If your already sold anyways use it as a talking down point check your KBB & NADA listed pricing ne dealer buys for more then the lowest listed price and they sell at the top side but will take the middle and maybe even a little under of you have good points about common problems with your particular vehicle. Good luck and I hope they have what you not just need but want!"
9419,Not too bad of a mall
9420,Awesome stores & well kept clean
9421,Always the best breakfast
9422,Great owner.
9423,We don't go to this theater very often as the quality of the pictures and quality of the screens lack big time. You can see the creases in the screen and color differences between sections of the screen. Also a blue dot. Yes a blue dot on the screen when the movie is playing. It's annoying to say the least. If you are from another state I don't suggest enjoying a movie here. The service is always friendly here and it is a clean theater.
9424,Ok
9425,Great place to get cannabis!
9426,Donuts are amazing
9427,Seriously awesome ice cream!!! If you are headed up to eklutna lake it's worth it to stop and enjoy homemade ice cream. In some of they're ice creams they have local flavors like fireweed. We enjoy stopping here!

9452,"(Translated by Google) When visiting the Portage glaciers, we went to this information station and the service was phenomenal. The place has a place of sighting of the lake and the glaciers; with informative signs and a counter where, according to the type you have, they suggest the trip to the glacier that suits you, we went to the Byron glacier, with a two-hour walk, you arrive at a large river at the base of the glacier, and A large bed of stones. A spectacular place!

Toys for kids and apparel."

9481,"Every time I eat Taco Bell I ask myself, ""WHY do I do this to myself?"". The food is OK, at best, but not bad. The assembly is always careless and very sloppy.  There are just better options for Mexican food here.  EXCEPT in the middle of the night. Thus... A trip to üåÆ Taco Bell."

9508,The best pizza ever
9509,"Good food, lots of selection. My husband had the Alfredo, kids had Mac and cheese, and I had the pub steak. I wasn't a big fan of all the different sauces, one on my steak, one on my veggies. Mashed potatoes were pretty good. Bread was amazing. As well as the Mac and cheese. Alfredo was ok. Loved the brownie dessert as well.

9550,"I eat at the Niggivikput restaurant regularly, and have found most of the food I've tried there to be excellent.  The wait staff is friendly and very attentive, and the prices are on par with other offerings in Barrow.  They're constantly updating the  menu items, so there's almost always something new to try."
9551,I was a bit disgusted at the fact that the cooks were handling our food with their bare hands. He's grabbing raw meat to toss onto the grill then wrapping my breakfast burrito. Hopefully I don't get sick
9552,"Worst place ever never again place was empty but for one table. First no greeting when I entered 2 the person in front of me ordered two simple sandwiches that took twenty minutes the sandwich maker never called for help other employee could be heard working in back she walked by once and several minutes later 2hen she realized he had mad little progress she then came and took my order, I ordered the chicken sub but their was none thawed out and the line was filthy and poorly stocked not acceptable in an empty restaurant took pictures and will be contacting management"

9554,Pretty standard gas station. Nothing fancy.
9555,"Very good, and delicious."
9556,"Overall things balanced out to an okay experience.  I had a very tasty shake and some ""bottomless"" fries to go along with it.  The atmosphere was quite loud, much more rambunctious than I have experienced in other Red Robins, even though it didn't seem that busy.  It made it a little difficult to talk with the group I was with.  It also took a long time for us to get refills on our ""bottomless"" items.  Perhaps it was just an off day or they were a little short-staffed?  I did enjoy all the different art pieces you could check out."

9572,"I was looking forward on buying a lemon meringue pie. Asked the lady working at the bakery section if they had any lemon meringue pie. She said no, however, she asked for my number, with my understanding that when they make some lemon meringue pie, she would call me. To my surprise three days later after my therapy section's, I walked over to Carrs and lord and behold, there was a lemon meringue pie in the freezer! Did I buy it NOPE, got upset of the lack of effort, on them not calling me like they said. So I went to Fred and Myers and brought me my lemon meringue pie!"

9590,"The rudest person I have ever incountered. Mona who answered the phone was no help, rude and down right mean. If I employed this person, I would fire her.

9591,Omg so good
9592,Service was friendly.
9593,"Independence Mine State Historical Park is a fascinating place if you love history. The site still has most of the original buildings and has signs explaining each one. It was very fun to walk around and read each sign and go into the buildings. (You can't go into all of them, but you can go into several.)"
9594,Great place and great service really quick
9595,"Awesome hike. Local spot, gets a lot of traffic sometimes."
9596,I was shopping for Christmas tree. Prices are fair compared to Lowes. I like here better because they open the trees so you can really check them and make a good decision.
9597,"Can't get enough of this place. I think I've worn out three credit cards so far and working on another. If you need something in quantity or just like to see what's new, this is the place to go. Also a good, quick food stop with very reasonable prices - for Anchorage..."
9598,Love the biscuits and gravy.
9599,"Middle Way is always a great bet when it comes to breakfast!  Quick, healthy, and consistently pleasing!"
9600,Huge selection
9601,"Quick, convenient and delicious!"
9602,I love theor sandwich but the has been a decline in service recently.  I still recommend  for lunch.
9603,"I have very high standards for all services and they did an awesome job with tires , balancing , staff, whole package.  Even price was better than the others I checked out."
9604,Sicilys pizza always comes through when you need them to. Especially nice drivers and delivery time is FAST!
9605,Very educational. Great to see the eco-friendly building in one of the most scenic places on Earth. Trually wild. Fresh air blue skies. It is most definitely worth visiting. It is well worth the bus ride. Denali is a place that amazing. It's trually special. If you are wanting to go. You should. I can't wait to go back soon.
9606,"Just a run of the mill breakfast. Honestly could have gotten the same quality of food at Denny's. Very packed on a Saturday morning. Wait staff was overwhelmed. This is evident in the 20 minutes we sat at the table before we asked if someone was going to take our order. Food was hot and fresh. Took another 20 minutes for us to get our check after we had finished eating. For a place that is trying to move customers in and out of the door, you wouldn't know it."
9607,It smells like good weed!
9608,Khols is great Nichol and Misty both helped me find what I was looking for and did it with extreme accuracy and respect never did i get any attitude or bad vibe from them they seemed very happy and more then willing to help me find what I was looking for thanks again Misty and Nichol you guys are great!
9609,Get all my parts here
9610,Liquor dept had everything we went in for. So not bad
9611,Good food and good menu.  Gets crowded and gets backed up.
9612,Great workout. Family friendly due to stairs and well outlined path. View from the top is awesome on a clear day.
9613,Great pricing for 2-4 people and for party rates. They have discounts for military and UAF students on certain days. My kids had a blast. I can't wait to go back.
9614,Fresh
9615,"This is a diner and even though they were packed when we went for Sunday breakfast, the service was fantastic. My bacon and eggs were perfect but the gravy on my biscuit was pretty tasteless. They have a lot of variety on the menu and the portions are very large, but the prices are not cheap."
9616,"Food quality was very good and nicely presented. Prices are in the high range for the ambience, tables are small and seating is tight."
9617,Decent food for the price.  Fryer grease needs to be changed more frequently.
9618,"it's freakin' huge, complete with a sitting/cafe area and fireplace. Nuts!"
9619,They do a good job filling the niche of 'oysters and champagne as their selection of both is quite varied.    Not a place to go on a budget: oysters are $3 each and champagne starts at $12/glass and goes up from there.  VERY tiny venue!  Great atmosphere.
9620,The staff is slow and inconsistent. You order stuff but they don't add it to your order. You always have to check your bag to make sure you got everything and they made the food the way you ordered.
9621,"Nice little bar. Couple pool tables, juke box. Perfect for frosty beverage and conversation. Nothing fancy but clean and friendly."
9622,"Even though to me it's better to watch movies at home, it's still great to go out and have some fun."
9623,Delicious
9624,Best soup and salad bar on the Kenai
9625,Good food pretty waitress.üòÅ
9626,Absolutely love this place! And process are reasonable for being Alaska!!
9627,"Its alright. Nice selection of beers. I had an amber and it wasn't forgettable.  Go with friends. Its kind of dull if you're there on your own. Although, they were grilling pizzas outside as i left. That could have been cool."
9628,Nothing to write home about
9629,"Macaroons making me macrazy.
But really, an incredibly easy way to gain 10 lbs by eating all the cookies.

They send their employees to France one time a year for macaroon training, and it shows. Each one is the exact same texture, and the flavor in every bite.
The flavor options are hit or miss, but that's personal preference, not lack of culinary skills."
9630,Service was fast. There was a nice quiet atmosphere. Plates were large and filling.
9631,Great place!!! My kids had a blast.  Good pricing as well.
9632,Great selection of apitizers and beer on tap
9633,Pretty solid ramen! Very spicey if requested.
9634,"Got my iD fast by nothing but knowing my social and birth place, so i give them 5 stars"
9635,"Nice staff, quality service, quick turnaround."
9636,"If I could give a zero I would. Word of advice, make sure YOU check all the fluid levels before you leave.  They will do whatever they can to cover up their mess and leave you with the bill. They caused irreversible damage and basically told us to get bent."
9637,Nice mall.
9638,Very well I hope to see you all soon there
9639,"Employees always have a good time, and the food always pleases."
9640,Clean one stop shopping
9641,"The Hot Turkey sandwich was great, but the berry smoothie has been changed from the original, and I didn't like the berry smoothie at all. Although I did see that their giving cheese with the bowl of chili now.

Chicken bakes are still good and the rest is eh just there."
9642,Unbelievable food and atmosphere!  If you want to show your loved one a lovely evening or just treat yourself this is the place.  From the staff to the sweet course you will be moved.
9643,Wait staff was friendly and accessible. The good is absolutely delicious! Even if wings aren't for you there are tons of alternatives
9644,Water heater I needed was out of stock couldn't find anybody to help me locate a new one or know anything about it
9645,Beautiful views
9646,Prices seem high
9647,Shop are in between season s
9648,Burgers were great! Servers very friendly! Patio seating...very cozy & quaint.
9649,The price for a family of 6 was great with the special I got! The experience that we have on the boat seeing the humpback whales and the orcas was Unforgettable. The prime rib and salmon Buffet on Fox Island was more than I expected in terms of taste! I'm thinking of making this a yearly tradition!
9650,Kids pool is so warm.
9651,Great place to watch birds all year around.
9652,"Love Cabelas, great place for outdoor needs. Bargain cave is good for great deals."
9653,"Nice room, although a little noisy. North Fork restaurant food was excellent but the building was over heated a lot. Good staff too."
9654,Large park with hundreds of miles of trails most of them paved. Access to the beach. Lots of families and outdoor people enjoying it. Plus you may see a moose
9655,"The Meatball sandwich I had was pretty good for the most part. I didn't taste the cheese when eating, which Is probably not a good thing. Overall though, it's a good sandwich place and I would give it a try."
9656,"If you are into sandwiche's, or healthy food, this is the place to go, you can sit down,& eat, or take  out. I LOVE THIS PLACE, IT'S A FABULOUS PLACE TO GO. They're Friendly,& pretty fast,& understanding here. I ALWAYS  feel welcome here. üòãüòÅüòéüëßüëåüëçüíóüíñüíØ"
9657,"Good brews, nice and friendly staff, but crowded then what would you expect in a tourist town on the 4th of July....  If you go be sure to stop, you'll enjoy"
9658,Good location.
9659,It was ok
9660,This place has such a variety of things for everyone!! And everyone is helpful. And don't  forget your fishing and hunting licenses!!
9661,Clean with good displays
9662,"I Sked do they install  parts guy said yes, had a throttle position sensor  sensor  he said he has to put whole throttle body   he must think every body is a dummy why not  install  what the customer wants  not what you  want"
9663,Slow service
9664,"Lots of fun!  Location is downtown Fairbanks, so, a bit on the quirky/quaint/hinky/eccentric/run-down side...leave your valuables at home as there is no place to put them inside and you don't want to leave them in your car... I enjoyed the explanations on what to do and not do - nice sense of humor üòÑ  I wish the cost was a little less or that there were coupons or referral bonuses or something - $30 per person for 1 hour seems a bit much.  That said, we will go back again! (and maybe get a coupon/discount?  Hint, hint?)  üòÅüòÅ"
9665,Dirty looking when I was there. Smelled of strong cleaning or bug control chemicals.
9666,Rustic place...fair prices...good variety of people.
9667,"Restaurants, hot spring, ice Museum, so much to do here.  Very good facilities."
9668,Most bang for your buck. And delicious
9669,I really enjoy their steak salad.
9670,"Amazing Food, get the chajangmyuon"
9671,I'm happy to deal with terrible parking and battle carts for cheap food. Costco door staff often draws smiley faces on our receipts for my 7 year old son. Nice little thing he gets a kick out of.
9672,"Nice variety of runs on the hill. The lodge is nothing extravagant, but it was an enjoyable place to ski."
9673,Fun
9674,Nice place.
9675,Ok but would be nice to use quarters
9676,Nice store.  Good selection. Friendly service.  Very good prices.
9677,"I must say, skeptical at first cause of the looks of the building, inside and out, but once you get a taste of any of their choices, you will be glad you walked in. I've had a few of their sandwiches and have loved every single one. My favorite though, is their chicken wrap. I always add avocado to it with extra of their ranch dressing and it's heaven in each bite. The price is what is expected of sub places, not cheap, yet not pricey either. I tend to go there for my lunch break over any other restaurant in the downtown area.

UPDATE: This is my first time going since they changed ownership about 2 months ago. I must say, although the chicken wrap is still delicious, the serving size has decreased drastically. They are charging me an extra dollar for avocado now with less in there than the $.75 cents they were charging before. Also, they had/have this promo where if you buy 10 sandwiches, you get the 11th free (punch card tracking). The old ownership would allow me to use my punch card for the chicken wrap with avocado included whereas the new ownership is charging me for the avocado now. Even though it's still cheaper than most of their food items. I will commend them on the customer service, they were all (2) very friendly when I showed up for my pick up. They had my wrap bagged up and ready to go really quick but that could be because there weren't any customers in there but 1 sitting and eating their food. I don't know how factual this is yet but I think they might be doing away with their soups. That may hurt them a lot since they have a huge crowd that goes just for their soups."
9678,I really enjoyed eating here. The wait staff was very timely even when there was a larger than usual group of us. The food was served very hot and fresh. Thankful for the unending root beer floats.
9679,Always feel safe and welcome in this bar.
9680,Not too shabby of a place for some beer and burgers. Average service. Pretty nice portions for prices.
9681,Quick and reasonable breakfast / lunch
9682,Nice community
9683,Classic and greasy.
9684,Must stop at Anchorage
9685,"The food was poorly prepared,  and of poor quality"
9686,Great prices on beer and amazing food. The service is stellar.
9687,I had what might have been the best burger in Anchorage! I can't wait to take my wife there and try something else.
9688,Fun for kids
9689,Friendly service.
9690,Nice
9691,"Good drinks, pretty legit Mexican food"
9692,Favorite place
9693,Love this place
9694,Gluten and Dairy Free Options! Unfortunately the staff was less then welcoming and none of them knew the WiFi password. Normally this wouldn't be an issue but it was advertised all over the store and we recently moved so I was in need of a place for kids to  talk to their deployed Dad.
9695,Love the location. ‚ù§Ô∏è
9696,"Has a wide variety of teas and other goods, I really love their chocolates and spices. Their taco seasoning is great"
9697,Wonderful staff bringing me delicious food! Awesome place.
9698,Expensive salads for what you get.
9699,My wife loves this place she could eat here every day and multiple times a day.
9700,"Fast, friendly, and great every time"
9701,A little more that you would expect
9702,My complaints are that their live pet selection is very small and they seem to focus on very small pets like mice or hamsters or fish
9703,"Really exceptional.  Our experience recently at the Coast International Inn at Lakehood  was well above average.  The location, proximity to a floatplane seaport and the Town of Anchorage was a blend of the best of both worlds.  Their shuttle service is the best I've experienced anywhere.  On our final day, we had a smooth checkout and another shuttle ride to the Alaska Bus terminal.  There we hopped aboard a Veggie-oiled powered diesel 20 passenger vehicle that drove us all the way from Anchorage to the Town of Homer at ""Lands End"".

The combination of Alaska Airlines, Coast International at Lake Hood and the the Alaska Bus scenic 200 mile drive was AMAZING!"
9704,Prices to high meat selection could be better service has gone down hill
9705,Nice store very helpful
9706,"Delivery is is a rip-off, Never Again, you pay for your order yet always something/s is always missing."
9707,Went to get a slow leak fixed. 40 minutes It was taken in and done. Thanks guys!
9708,"Friendly, great customer service. Food was hot, fresh and ready to go! All the employees were working together really well. Keep up the great team work!  You don't see that in fairbanks these dsys!"
9709,Fast friendly service.
9710,"EXCELLENT SERVICE! Paul and west were fantastic, they went above and beyond to make sure we got extended information on our new happy pets. Very friendly, compassionate and professional service.  Will be a return customer!"
9711,Good selection and prices reasonable.
9712,Don't want to shoot I was just after you does it really did like that but thenbnb guy;^ w bnüôÇüé±hat
9713,Love the breakfast waiting staff is always nice.
9714,Love the variety of pet supplies and natural foods and treats.
9715,great food.... but had to be the worst service I have ever seen. the waitress tried to deliver the wrong food to us severall times and the waiter tried to take our order twice in five minutes. It was crazy
9716,Amazing fish and chips the staff is very friendly and professional .
9717,"took too long to get our order, and they dix not bring as t the same time for my wife snd me."
9718,Great selection of pet supplies. High quality with affordability and the customer service was exceptional.
9719,"The burgers are great, although they did mess up the order. The chicken wings were light on the seasonings despite being halfway up the hot scale."
9720,Wait time was long in drive thru.
9721,Wonderful food! Professional friendly services!
9722,"An amazing lodge near Talkeetna, it has beautiful views, spacious rooms, walking trails, bike paths."
9723,"Do not pay attention to delivery driver, in need of better customer service!"
9724,The best Walmart in the Anchorage area. Comfortable atmosphere. Bravo
9725,"It's small, kind of a wrap around strip mall size. But it's cute. In the winter it's nice to window shop as they have a few stores (including hot topic), benches, and it's indoors so it's warm. They also sometimes have vendors here like artists, jewelry makers, and bee keepers selling local honey."
9726,The prices are great and the staff is always pleasant
9727,The Crow's nest breakfast was really great.
9728,Awesome
9729,Great place for late night drinks when I want to party
9730,Amazing food
9731,Fun easy going upscale atmosphere with attentive bar tenders.
9732,Very friendly and they promise to match every offer in the state.üëç
9733,Nic place
9734,It was good but i dont eat there alot. I would stop by a little more if they had low carb tortillas.
9735,Nice place
9736,I like it
9737,Good place to stop at
9738,"This is a must stop when going to Eklutna Lake. They have several Alaska flavors, the best of which is Fireweed Honey. The Wildberry and Blueberry is excellent as well. We make this a yearly trip because it is that good. This year we got a Caramel Breve hit coffee, it was good too, not watered down or over sugary."
9739,Decent. Busy most of the time.
9740,Convenient location with service to airport or train station. Breakfast selection was great for a four night stay. Nightly cookies after a day of exploring Fairbanks. Rooms cleaned and up to date. Occasionally could hear airplanes or road noise but not too close to road. Would definitely stay again if traveling in Fairbanks
9741,"a little nicer than some walmart, but it's still a Walmart at checkout lol"
9742,"Not your regular donut, the creative mastermind behind these delicious mashups brings new things to the table every week. Great donuts and good coffee"
9743,"Great prices, impressive portion sizes, friendly staff."
9744,"Store employees were very helpful getting the item that I wanted, and loading it into my vehicle after I purchased the water softener salt."
9745,Helpful cheerful staff
9746,"Barbers name was Drew, was lucky with no real queue on Sunday, easy going conversation, no feeling of being rushed and was able to suggest and deliver great haircut. Price was midrange, and this place is now probably my favorite barber shop."
9747,"Only coffee stand I go to and I don't even order their coffee, lol. Been a fan of the red bull smoothies since they came out!"
9748,Very nice all the way around
9749,"Window assistant was rude, slow, and inaccurate. We got our food and didn't have our drinks. Instead of asking us if there was anything else I had to remind him about our drinks."
9750,"Great place, friendly staff. A great place to shop for home improvement and hardware. They sell many boards by the foot and have the pest prices on lumber I‚Äôve found. Also have chicken feed. Would recommend."
9751,Outstanding food and great service. Mooses Tooth will always be a favorite!
9752,Recommend concealed carry. Sales professionals available for your 'medication' needs at all hours!
9753,Great coffee in a neat location. A good place for vegan foods. Plenty of baked goods at the register.
9754,"Food was good, view amazing. Sit in the restaurant. Christian was our server and he was great! Super helpful, friendly, answered questions. Also, we were probably the last table of the night sat less than 15 minutes to close and he seemed happy we were there and that he could serve us.

If we were sat immediately in the bar and just met Christian the would be more than a 5 star review. However, we went to the bar first waiting on a table. The bartender seemed uninterested in having more people to help claiming that several seats at the bar were taken by patrons that were outside smoking. Other customers got up while we waited for seats and sat next to these empty seats. Multiple times people tried to sit in these empty bar seats and were greeted with an abrasive bartender asking,  ""Do you plan on staying here?"" Then after someone's reply she would say there are people sitting here but they are outside smoking. There was two water glasses in those seats that looked like dirty dishes as they were sweating from the completely melted ice that once was in the glass. We sat at the bar for about an hour, I think the hostess forgot we were waiting on a table but that was ok cause a patron sitting next to us was great conversation. If the bartender was our experience here this would be a 2 star review with only the view making up for the stars. Sit in the restaurant. You will get great service and a wo derful view sans attitude from the bartender who doesn't want to tend bar...."
9755,My burger was over cooked and the place was a mess and disorganized.
9756,Friendly staffing and very nice atmosphere i will definitely shop here again
9757,I loved Walmart with lowest prices.
9758,Close to all the shopping store.
9759,"A must visit if you can. We took the Kantishna Shuttle all the way in to the park and back and was a great way to explore the park. A trip to Wonder Lake is highly recommended. Great views of Mt Denali. We also got a chance to see a lot of wildlife - bears, wolves, dall sheep, moose and caribou with a lot of birds and other small animals."
9760,"Good place, better then our old theatre by far. Needs more business"
9761,Out of business
9762,Very Professional....
9763,Challenging parking but worth the visit. Great variety of camper shells and knowledgeable sales folk.
9764,Lots of Antiques
9765,Good greasy food.
9766,"Good quality work, friendly folks. Got us in and out on time."
9767,"Beautiful hike, with an awesome view"
9768,"This is THE BEST FOOD IN TOWN. The food was amazing, the decor was beautiful,  and the staff was great. Love this place."
9769,Fast service open late
9770,"(Translated by Google) Ahhhhhhhhhhhh sushi !!!!!!!

(Original)
Ahhhhhhhhhhh sushi!!!!!!!"
9771,Everything too expensive there
9772,"They remodeled the store to make it like the other ones, and now it sucks. Smaller and less variety, can't find anything and there was absolutely no reason because it's an fn safeway"
9773,Friendly service. Excellent pho! Most tend to be too salty but this was perfect. The spring rolls were a little bland though.
9774,It's ok. Just like any other walmart in town. Shelve stock of variety of items.
9775,It was so beautiful there and I had caught a cute little frog on the bottom of the path that goes down.
9776,"There were like 6 people there, karaoke was cancelled, it was a bust... left after 5 minutes.... Halloween ... it was dead. üôÑ"
9777,Drink was good.... but had to wait 45 minutes for a coffee. Saw woman at window talking loudly with other patrons and made there drinks before mine.
9778,"Is super good ,not to high price"
9779,"Old fashioned lunch place, with traditional food.  The sliders are great"
9780,Great flower shop.  They even did our wedding flowers and they were very affordable.
9781,"This is my fav fred meyers store in anchorage. The layout is easy to guide through to find what your looking for. They have great quailty clothes at great prices, plus they always have sales going on. I went here on blackfriday super busy, lots of people everywhere, & the workers I spoke with and cashier were so helpful, friendly, and fast. When available I always try to stop at this store. The produce, bakery and sushi is always great.... deli...not so appealing. Only flaw. Bank usually has a line  and staff is rude"
9782,Pizza is always fresh and good always hot.
9783,"This being one of my favorite place to eat and take my family was rather disappointing today, I ordered my favorite dish and ended up chewing some glass which took my appetite and of course I didn't order anything else. So sad this happened because Olive Garden was one of my favorite places."
9784,I love this family. Quality work with fair prices. All 10 of my toenails were ingrown when I came in for a pedicure and Ms. Tu took care of me like it was nothing. I felt so much better when I left other than the general soreness associated with ingrown toenails. I won't go anywhere else.
9785,Large store has more groceries compared to other targets in Alaska. They‚Äôre currently under construction in the Starbucks and Pizza Hut department and their customer service area. The stores clean their cleaning the registers after every use as much as possible. Enjoyed my quick shopping trip for essentials.
9786,My food was cold. The beef was not seasoned and my sweet potatoes fries tasted sour for some reason.  It was my first time eating there and I don't plan on ever returning.
9787,"I ordered a pizza for pick up picked it up no problems. Got home and not even 5 min later they called my phone telling me they had me on camera stealing tips from the jar and the cops have already been called that i needed to bring them back and that they had already watched the cameras. So i return to the store knowing theyre mistaken walk in and ask where the manager is. ""hes in the back watchin the cameras"" . . . Soo you called the cops on me before you knew who it was? After all said and done they found out it wasnt me and that there werent any tips to begin with. Never got an apology and to this day my name is in the computer as a DO NOT SERVE at all pizza huts. Thanks guys. you do your jobs GREATTT."
9788,The food doesn't get enough love. This place is fun and let's people sing terribly so that you can do the same and smile/laugh with those closest. Friendly staff and community make Asia Garden a locals favorite.
9789,Decent food and good customer service but a little over priced
9790,"Impressive! I remember leroys back in the day as that late night breakfast place that was open years ago. This night I honestly didn‚Äôt want to come here but my family insisted, and holy moly have they come along way the pancakes were delicious the smell omg just great kudos to the cooks! Oh and can‚Äôt forget the coffee it was good too!  Staff was nice our server I think her name was molly, hustled and was friendly and beautiful young lady even if she delt with some drunk ppl. Overall I truly enjoyed leroys keep up the good work. We will be back"
9791,In summer its amazing
9792,"Great place to shoot, big on safety, follow the rules and have fun!"
9793,Excellent options and their handmade cupcakes are incredible!
9794,One of Anchorage's better sushi place. Good selection of rolls and their fried rice is one of my family's favorite. The owner Jeff is super friendly and does know how to take care of his customers.
9795,Over charge for used games and don't offer fair compensation for the same games when traded in.
9796,I met the owner and he is such an amazing person. Very accommodating and a joy to work with. The best service I've ever received at any pizza establishment. Not to mention the most beautiful pizza pie!! Thank you! (P.S. I love the music selection that was playing! ü§òüèºü§òüèº)
9797,The boxes are affordable and not gross
9798,"Not happy with the service,won't be going back to them for anything"
9799,Nice ... serene
9800,More variety then the other 2 stores in town
9801,Bought dog treats
9802,Great view
9803,"This review is purely from the perspective of a former employee. I believe in what the agency tries to accomplish and their mission statement. However, this is by far one of the most discriminatory and self serving agencies I have ever worked for/with in my career. I believe a huge part of this is due to the small town mentality and being the only agency of its kind in Seward. The Board of Directors are clueless and in fact they are so behind the scenes that I met maybe 3 of them during my 6 years as an employee.  The Executive Director does not separate her religious beliefs from her decision making. It's really a shame because there is so much potential for them to make a positive impact on the community but they need new management."
9804,Great place check it out üòÉ
9805,Best food in town
9806,"Food was fairly authentic, delicious, and tasted very fresh. Service was fast and friendly."
9807,The fishing is great.
9808,"Very cool place, good food and a great veiw. Great for dates and family dinners alike."
9809,so went through the drive-thru last night and the lady messed up my order and didn't even give me my receipt and today King fix my order
9810,"To start with the positive, the food is hot and good when you get it.

The negative is attempting to order your food is very difficult and there are frequent errors on the order."
9811,Great pizza for a great state
9812,Amazing event to visit... fun for the family and kids. Dress warm from head to toe...
9813,"As a travel agent: I highly recommend this tour operation.
Candace and her family set up marvelous tours in Alaska.  Good prices and lovely people. Staff is friendly and they know the territory.
I did the dog sledding at Dallas Seavey. We did dog sledding, walked in the snow with special shoes and had a treat of smores. I can't tell you the chocolate used...you have to take the tour to find out.

I can also set up tours and packages with Salmon Berry.
Send me a message."
9814,Excellent ceviche!
9815,Food was great customer service was horrible and no refill on coffee
9816,Gotta love the gear here...
9817,Satisfying staple food
9818,Thank you!
9819,Food is Ok and the service is usually good. The BBQ is ok for most. As long as your not from Memphis or Texas or are a connaisseur of other BBQs.
9820,Always good
9821,"Always order online first utilizing the drive thru for quick service... The coffee tends to be abit on the bitter side everytime, but acceptable..."
9822,Good variety new and untouched areas.
9823,It was like every other extended stay.
9824,"Quick, reasonable, professional, and friendly people to work with. I left with having all the options in my surgical case explained.  Questions were answered and explained. I would recommend this facility to anyone who has an orthopedic issue."
9825,My first time dipnetting. Much windier than I expected.
9826,Great food as usual
9827,Good prices
9828,Reasonably priced restaurant in Healy good for comfort food.
9829,Great food and nice atmosphere.
9830,Staffed by friendly locals this venue hosts a wide array of local and traveling talents. The only reasons I don't give it a five-star is due to lack of any dancing floor space and sound quality issues on more than one occasion

9832,Good found what I needed and then left
9833,Service can be a little slow but taco Tuesday is a must. Then men's bathroom is sticky and stinks sometimes
9834,Always great food and service.
9835,Terrible service and menu is why over priced. Will not return. We were seated quickly and got drinks (soda). But that's it. 15 mins went by and the server never came back. We finally waved the waitress down just for her to tell us the bar tender would be our waitress. We waited a few more mins. We took a few sips from our drinks and they made us pay 9 dollars for 3 soda's. Will not be returning or recommending this place.

9841,"Stopped in yesterday afternoon for some fried rice and it was so good I came back tonight for supper! I can taste why its number 1 Thai in Fairbanks! The Thai Tea is splendid as well, I will be back soon and regularly!"
9842,"Kriner's Diner is still one of my favorite places to grab a burger. My personal favorite is the Alaskan burger, I add bacon, with nice hot crinkle fries...it makes an excellent lunch with great service, friendly folks in a relaxed and comfortable ambiance..."

9844,Great food and service

9848,Just about anything you need
9849,"I originally gave The Landing Hotel a 4-star review.  But the GM reached out to me, I mean, THAT is service.  I have edited my original post to a 5-star review."
9850,Super cool pit stop with more than just a parking lot
9851,Very knowledgeable staff at this location. Was able to get my phone problems resolved in one stop. GCI has many service plans and they were able to explain which one is the best for me cost wise.  At another location I had been told I would have to post a huge deposit and the staff here was willing to take the time to double check and determine that a deposit was not required to establish a cellphone service.
9852,"Best place to go if you want a proper line up! And all the homies can cut, no matter your race 100 #YLG #DaTruf (If I wrote it, then its tru)"
9853,Great food as always!
9854,"Smelliest store in Anchorage! Yuck, nasty and stinky"
9855,"If you want some pure nature with a few of those needed amenities,  visit Kodiak, AK!"
9856,I think the only classy restaurant in town with a quality selection of food and drinks. It has an excellent wine selection.
9857,"Good food, fast service. Children's playground could be stinky."
9858,Awesome foods & drinks
9859,Scrumptious wings. Good beverages. Was there when they had a lovely band playing on a week night.  Even have a small dance floor. Rooms off to the side for meetings or parties. I will get back there to try other foods as soon as I can. Service is EXCELLENT
9860,The staff is really nice and they have live music occasionally. The prices are a bit high.
9861,Went in for a quick coffee and bite.  Not a frequent McDonalds customer.  Staff was great.
9862,"best food in matsu valley period! I haven't had 1 thing that wasnt prepared to perfection. crab cakes, sandwiches loaded tots, soup!"
9863,"Went, was there"
9864,Great food very filling  and amazing
9865,Great spot to find some of Alaskas most engaged entrepreneurial minds!
9866,I did not like the attittude of the workers there. Plus I found things in my room thst diffinltly
9867,It was great awesome burgers
9868,Great service!!!!!!
9869,We try to go every Friday for fish tacos. I ate their twice this week!
9870,"This Subways is pretty good, compared to other subways in rural areas. The only odd thing about this subway is that they sell pizza of all things. It's the second subway I know of in Alaska that sells Pizza, aside from the Anchorage Walmart on Debarr Road. Anyway, I would recommend this subway if you need a sandwich in Valdez."
9871,"Great food, fast service, and calm quiet atmosphere. Probably one of the best Mexican resturaunts I've been to. Location is sketchy, but all in all a great place"
9872,"Same as Seward Waterfront,  is the same place.  Very busy,  1st come, first served."
9873,Good service
9874,Clean good music
9875,Staff was great to work with
9876,Good sushi! But not enough options if you are gluten free. Bring your own gluten free soy sauce.
9877,"When I was a child, I remember going here with my grandmother and cousins. The pizza was predictably decent, the place was dark and full of wood paneling and the like in that fashion from the time. I remember being in high school and dropping a couple of quarters in a video game machine there in the lobby while waiting for my pizza.

I went here recently, with my granddaughter and my husband. The EXACT SAME VIDEO GAME was still in the lobby. The paneling was still there. The old bench seats from when I was a child? Still there. Everything was a little bit darker because, you know, age and all. Decades of dust, regardless of how well tended, had darkened the upholstery on the top of the seats.

The waiter was surprised that anybody was walking in for food. He nonetheless was very friendly and helped us come up with an affordable order of food. When the pizza came out, it was still predictably decent, a good, standard Pizza Hut pizza.

I guess they get points for nostalgia and retro and all, and I cannot fault them for anything. But this is a really good location, and it deserves a bit of an update, instead of looking like a run down ""after"" set for a time travel movie."
9878,Nice restaurant
9879,Love the food but the dining area could be better
9880,Very friendly staff
9881,"Straightforward accommodations within a quick drive to the park entrance, but not stuck in the hubbub of ‚Äúthe canyon‚Äù. We had a great stay here."
9882,"Best pho restaurant in Anchorage, AK. My family's 1st choice when dining out. Clean environment. Friendly staffs. Great tasty food. Spring rolls, pho, chicken wings, roasted ducks, pathai, and vermicelli noodles are my favorite here."
9883,Expensive but really tasty. They have a wide variety of homemade ice creams.
9884,Always have a blast attending the performances. Top notch productions. I highly recommend VPA.
9885,"The place is nice, the beer glasses are great. Hate shaker pint ""craft"" brewerys. This place doesn't have that. But there's a lot not great about it too. For instance 6 out of 10 taps are IPA's. I mean come on, is this all craft beer is? That was certainly disappointing. Also the beer names... lame."
9886,Awesome Everything

She made sure I was comfortable the entire time and that the stone temperature was acceptable. The room was beautiful, the music soothing and the staff professional and kind. I highly recommend Adagio if you need an escape and some pampering."
9896,They would rather me take my cat to the pound then drop her off there. Lady was erude saying I would take an emergency cage instead of a stray. Hours on voice-mail should be updated to what they actually are also(covid isn't new anymore) Shocked a friend referred me here.
9897,"Best automatic carwash in the Anchorage area. Clean, professional and does the best job at washing my vehicles. The extras such as, drying towels at the end of the wash and the employees spraying prewash your cars before entering make me continue to return."

9900,Great good I'll recommend for everyone has craving for  Filipino dish you would love it
9901,"Good burger and fries. Onion rings were okay. We ordered delivery on a Wednesday at 5:05 in July 2020. Said would be 30-40 minutes. Didn't arrive until 6:15, an hour and ten minutes later. We had just about given up. Food was slightly cold so assume he did several at the same time. But still really enjoyed the burgers."
9902,"Always enjoy my shopping experience here.
Thanks for making it a breeze."
9903,Good food reminds me of home.

9906,"We stopped in after seeing all the commercials for El Rodeo. Strong margaritas, authentic entrees, and delicious desserts! Great service from the entire team and super accommodating to dietary exceptionalities. They also accept any local Mexican restaurants coupons. We will be back."
9907,I stopped in there about six months back and I don't know what was going on but their Fried Chicken was not on point. Today I'm very pleased to be able to say that that has changed and that they're classic high quality of fried chicken is back to its standard. Seriously this is one of the best places in town for fried chicken and for any types of shakes you may want
9908,"Good food fair price.  Staff was friendly and welcoming. Had the shrimp parm steak with salad, green beans, and cheesy broccoli.  Steak was cooked the way I ordered and the extra shrimp was worth the price.  Portion size was perfect for me .  Nice walk from hotel."

9917,"This place rules! First off, late night eats until 5am, perfect for hungry service industry folks. Ruben egg rolls, pork belly tacos, breakfast burritos, steaks, sandwiches, salads, milk shakes... The variety is great and the quality is high! $10/avg menu item price. Cool aesthetic inside, too."
9918,"Cool, laid back place with live music nightly.  Great local beer selection."
9919,"I dont know what happen this place but they are slacking... first my husband order a milk shake and he got a melted milk shake, my eggs where not even cooked all the way  and i they microwaved them? I got the same eggs and after i ate half of it i found a hair in eggs, my salad was welted like it had been frozen.. my appetizer came at the same time as the food to eat. come on man step up your game Denny!!!  i use to love to here been going here for 10+ years and went to eat there tonight and was shocked about how its fell off so much!!!!!! But the manger Lauren made everything right and has awesome customer service... they better not her go or they are screw.  ."

9923,"Best place for tint, vinyl wraps, paint protection film and so much more! They always take great care of every vehicle!"
9924,"After having climbed in several gyms in southern California and been to the old Anchorage rock gym dozens of times, I am happy to say that the new location and taller 60' walls are a tremendous upgrade and comparable to the best gyms in California. There is a weightliftimg area that is fantastic for cross fit and group workouts with a couple full sets of drop weights, regular yoga classes for those that are interested and an ample bouldering area. Routes are regularly updated and the staff are both skilled and highly professional. Birthday parties are common here and there are routes for all skill levels and ages. Not to mention they are right next door to Mooses tooth to quench your hunger and thirst after a good workout! I highly recommend the Alaska Rock Gym!"
9925,We were stunned at the $4 a gallon gas! The place looks like a dump and not well taken care of. Travel 30 miles North for normal gas prices and a decent place to stop.
9926,"Went on a whim because road trips need ice cream and was blown away. Ice cream was reasonably priced for specialty, good portion sizes and DELICIOUS.  WOW!"
9927,"Classic Italian pizza, and by that I mean not the thick dough and sausy tomato pie Americans are used to. It's light, fresh and flavorful. You taste each ingredient, and they're lovely. I highly recommend the prosciutto and melon appetizer. A sweet and salty delight that's a joy. Finally, finish with one of the fresh fruit gelato. Heavenly."
9928,Great food
9929,Not impressed
9930,Beautiful
9931,Beautiful!

9933,"Archangel is a beautiful bowl, gentle slopes for xc skiing along the 3 mile approach to the Reed Lake trailhead in the winter. Looking forward to hiking to the Lake this summer."
9934,Super. Premium. Ice cream. This is the best ice cream this side of the border. And the service is as smooth and comforting as the velvet thunder!
9935,"Clean affordable rooms, excellent, friendly staff, very quiet"
9936,Love the view and location if this place.... 1100....688...
9937,I love this place. Their spring rolls are the best!!! I almost always order the coconut sauce chicken. The chicken is super lean.
9938,They do haircuts the way you want not what they want for you!
9939,"What else can you say, marvelous scenery; buildings get high use, very clean.Sled dog talk needs revamp badly- pacing back and forth, repeating 'right' every 2 sentences."
9940,Such a great experience! They are doing a wonderful thing there.
9941,"The best shop in town.

I've had experiences from many shops, through my own experience, and through helping friends and family. Compared to the other 5 shops all over town I've had experience with, this is by far the best. They go out of their way to help their customers. They have great customer, cheap but great quality service."
9942,"Convenient, had Starbucks...good...a variety of stores."
9943,"The employees are friendly, fairly knowledgeable, and even though the reps aren't trained as technicians for phone repairs they try to help. If you are having technical difficultly I would suggest going to either apple or best buys Samsung guy because they can fix your issue. This att store is always  clean but can be crowded with people, so be patient it's worth the wait."
9944,Loving these beautiful  fall colors
9945,They do good work in helping disadvantaged youth.
9946,Good selection of unique mixers like elderflower club soda.  Super delicious.  You must wear a face mask as of today to visit this place.  FYI
9947,"Crowded, but always clean"
9948,"Wow! We just ordered for the first time and picked it up. I‚Äôm glad we used a gift certificate from Christmas because I would be angry to have had to PAY for this horrible food! We ordered 3 burgers, paid $48.00 plus tip and when I cut mine in half (the burgers are big) I ended up having to recook mine because it was too pink. The hamburger bun was a soggy mess which promptly fell apart into a unpalatable pile of mush! The French fries were also less than as far as taste and quality.  Save your money, I can‚Äôt imagine this place will stay open for any length of time considering my families experience with this restaurant.  0 stars"
9949,Excellent customer service and supplies.
9950,This was the first time we have been here and the food was horrible. But the lady at the front was nice. My step moms food was cold and my food was suppose to be ham but it was some kinda lunch meat but it definitely wasnt ham. We told them that it wasnt good and the manger got mad and we paid $40 for it and neither of us ate are food and they didn't give us a refund. Never coming back here!
9951,Could be more professional of service.
9952,Good American Style Japanese food.
9953,Always good food. Not always good for you.
9954,Love that they are updating! Can't wait to see the finished product!
9955,Very easy and convenient aslong you know what you need.
9956,Easily one of the best sandwiches I've eaten! All the ingredients are fresh and the specialty cheese was the cherry on top. Can't recommend them enough.
9957,Good pizza
9958,nice place
9959,Best and freshest Thai in Fairbanks!
9960,"It's about what you expect from any Taco Bell. Not particularly nice nor particularly trashy. The food is quick, service is decent. Lots of high school students, so, good to support someone's first job."
9961,Prefer Sportsman's Warehouse over Bass Pro & Cabela's.
9962,Great food and atmosphere!
9963,"Nice and new, but parking lot gets a bit difficult to navigate with the entrance/exits easily getting clogged"
9964,Great beer
9965,"Don't go unless it is a very last resort. It's clean but very frugal, and the price is really high."
9966,Delicious! Best pizza in Fairbanks!
9967,Troy is a detailed oriented Home Inspector. He literally checks everything and he gives you a great sense of confidence to know that if you are making a home purchase you can be assured that everything in the home will be checke and he will follow-up to ensure that whatever issues that came up previously  has been worked on and addressed so that eay you can rest assure in your mind that you are making a home purchase with confidence. We were thoroughly impressed as we were recommended to use this Home Inspector by our trusted realtor Connie Heyworth with Coldwell Banker.
9968,It's taco bell.
9969,"Didnt have my part, and didnt chase my disabled car away as i waited for part to come from anchorage :)"
9970,"Kids love the play area, oh wait, they don't have one at this location.  What is that all about? Only the Huffman location gets toys for the kiddos. I love the milkshakes"
9971,Is the grocery store what's there to rate I enjoyed Charles my cashier when I stop
9972,I went to Lowes because one of the managers said to bring my oven to the store and I could pick out another one. I was in the middle of baking bread for people and my oven fan went out again for the third time. My oven is electric. They didn't have the one I wanted in the entire state of Alaska. I wanted them to order the one I wanted and lend me a loaner until mine would come in 2-4 weeks. They had no electric range loaners. They had 1 cheap range for sale and that was it. They said to pick one of the floor models. I really didn't want any of them but I picked one because I needed something to cook with. The oven I have is horrible. The knobs are infront and not kid friendly...I have 7 kids. It's only one oven and the one I had and wanted replaced had 2 ovens. I am very unhappy. I cook all the time and feel like I was forced to settle for an oven I don't want all because they carry few electric ranges.
9973,"Been with you guys over 3 years , no problems, and praying it stays that way ‚ô•Ô∏è"
9974,Coffee is good
9975,Servings are small.
9976,"Stayed one night in the winter. Really nice, friendly staff."
9977,This new manager has the location cracking.  They have definitely turned this location around.
9978,"Food Is great, friendly, a bit slow, but it worth it."
9979,"Friendly fast service, lots of flavors"
9980,Great gluten free choices. The staff here is always super kind and upbeat. The food is delicious. We eat here often. I highly recommend this restaurant.
9981,"Used to be good food here- my family and I have been coming here for years! The fried rice is usually gross and the sesame chicken is definitely not sesame chicken. Last time I had this , my mother and I had food poisoning. Last time I brought a friend from out of state here... We found hair in his food. The workers simply denied our claims even after seeing the hair although they did take the plate, removed the hair and gave him the exact same plate. I would bit recommend this place and will not return."
9982,The best breakfast in Fairbanks by far.  Exceptional service.  Never a bad meal.
9983,"Smaller place than the big REIs, but has just about anything you might want for outdoor activities. Staff is helpful and prices are decent. They also usually have a pretty good clearance section."
9984,Lots of activities.
9985,"Not that many Burrito options.  But in all seriousness, just normal Mexican fast casual food."
9986,"Nice store, good inventory, walked around store and looked at everything I was interested in. No one offered to help me so I left."
9987,There are a lot of great places in this Mall
9988,Great place to come and eat good food great service

9990,"Well worth the admission, we will be back."
9991,"Love the Snow White Wheat, and the new Stout is great"
9992,Good service
9993,Experience in the shop is great. Don‚Äôt bother trying to call though. You‚Äôll never get through.
9994,Went to a string event very nice.
9995,"Since moving here about a month ago, been here 2x. The food has always been on par and the beer selection is phenomenal. Bartenders have always been welcoming"
9996,Service and the tea was old tasting
9997,"Food and service was good, $$$"
9998,Consistently good food
9999,"I like Popeyes in general, but this location is pretty bad. First if all, it‚Äôs not that clean. Every time I go in it just looks closer to grimy than shiny. Second of all, they mess up orders, even when it‚Äôs very slow. I was in there a few weeks ago when no other customers were there. We ordered a dozen chicken tenders and biscuits to go. They asked if I wanted spicy and I said no, so they told me I‚Äôd have to wait while they cooked them. That was fine...I‚Äôll wait for fresh chicken any time! But unfortunately, when I got the food home, the tenders were not only spicy, but VERY spicy. We couldn‚Äôt eat them due to stomach issues and so had to throw the whole box of chicken away. Dinner was 2 biscuits each...cost= about $24.00. Pretty expensive biscuits, huh?

Very annoying considering I sat at a table and waited 15 minutes for them to cook non-spicy chicken. And it is ain‚Äôt like they confused my order with someone else‚Äôs, since we were the only ones there!

It will be a while before I give this place another try. I don‚Äôt like throwing $24 in the garbage."
10000,One of my favorite spot to chill at
10001,Great prices
10002,Great office to get and try all of NPCR's coffee
10003,Customer service watches people load 12ft sheet rock by themselves and not one offer of help.
10004,Great place to learn
10005,This has always been my fav bookstore. Great place to come to and read while enjoying nice cafe food.
10006,"If you want ice cream with your favorite candy mixed together then visit Cold Stone Creamery.

I'm a simple guy, so I order plain-old ice cream.  Cold Stone Creamery doesn't use the scoops measurement, so you'll need to point to a cup size.  You'll get a cup size of ice cream in your waffle cone or waffle bowl.  I had vanilla in a waffle cone and it was very good.

There is plenty of seating here, but it won't take long to fill the seats.  In fact this location had a line out the door with four employees working.  The wait can be exhausting, but worse is the fact they have no seating outside.  On a sunny day sitting outside would be much nicer than inside beside a slow moving line of hungry people."
10007,"My FAVORITE place to eat Chinese food... in ALASKA. Yes I know there are nicer and more high end restaurants, but this place has awesome food and they fill up a plate. Sesame chicken is by far the best compared to anywhere else. Just my opinion."
10008,"Large store. Lots of Alaska souvenirs, tshirts sweatshirts, hats.  Liquor store, fairly well stocked. I was there late afternoon Saturday and some items were out of stock. Many other businesses conveniently close by. Best Buy, Subway, Sportsman Warehouse etc"
10009,It good ok
10010,Love going there for breakfast
10011,Older building but very spacious rooms and a great gastropub
10012,"My first visit - three years ago - the food was excellent. I haven't eaten here in a little over a year. My recent visit, the burgers were very greasy and not as good as they use to be. The fries were very salty and didn't seem fresh. The food just isn't as good as it used to be, especially for the price."
10013,Challenging but so much fun.
10014,This is my spot!!!!! I love their spicy shrimp yakitori!!! Also their salad dressing is so good I could seriously drink it! Never had a bad experience here and they'll always have me as a customer!!!!
10015,Nice recreation area in Fairbanks. Great work on cleaning it up and offering close local recreation.
10016,"Excellent food, service and people."
10017,We went for brunch very loud due to multiply tvs with football on food is great had to bring leftovers home will go back after football season
10018,The greatest waitress! Love to share their lives with you and their love of their customers! Goid food too!
10019,Has $5.00 lunch deal. Just like in the lower 48.
10020,"Less and less value every year. Now you can get 1 piece of prime rib for $2 less than the all you could eat buffet they had before covid which use to include salmon, cod, halibut, salad bar, prime rib hot dogs, desserts, drinks ect.  To get the salmon, cod and prime rib now its $80+
But they've also been removing menu items and giving you less for your money each year. So this isn't really much of  a surprise."
10021,It's very fun but the place looks cheap and old.
10022,Typical laundromat. Friendly service.
10023,Excellent chimichangas
10024,"Always a pleasure dropping in for a bite to eat. This time it was a quick stop on the way home, but the service was quick, friendly, and prompt, as always.
A note for those who have not yet tried their food, bring cash or be prepared to use the onsight atm."
10025,Loooove this place! Great and fast service. Portions are huge so they're totally worth the money! I had the chicken flautas which was so good. And the fried ice cream!
10026,Just another family park. Nothing special.
10027,Good place to go buy new  iphone Samsung or whatever kind of phone are looking for
10028,Cool
10029,"We've been saying for 2 years, let's try this spot, it's supposed to be really good.  And guess what, it was AWESOME!!  They only have 4 tables so everyone is cozy. The gal taking order tood one after another for a solid 30 minutes non stop. We shouldn't have waited so long. It's a must stop place. Oh except if you struggle to finish a regular burger you'll only be able to eat half of the gunslinger, so they make mini versions of all their burgers."
10030,Probably one of the best places to get sushi in Anchorage.
10031,Had a great time
10032,Fav place to go for crafty stuff
10033,"Sheena did an amazing job with my hair. Listened to what my requests were, offered her expert opinion and everything worked out wonderfully! The place has a relaxed and fun environment.  Was great!"
10034,Very helpful and friendly volunteers. The Food Pantry can be accessed once a month. Check their Lutheran Social Services Anchorage web page for times and location. Call the phone number for any additional details.

10080,I was there with a friend my friend's dog was really sick they got a blood test for the dog and if they were willing to read the blood test before they left they would have found out that the dog was really really sick but instead of reading the results they waited until the next business day which was over the weekend and ended up costing my friend a lot more money. And they had the results for sure before they left it's just really sad it could have cost a life.
10081,Helpful staff.
10082,Great quick stop for a great cup of java!
10083,Very nice atmosphere.  The food was spectacular.  Our waiter did a fine job in explaining the menu and the service was exceptional as it was unobtrusive.  Could not have had a nicer experience.

10099,"My father was visiting from out of town and we decided to take him to Seward for the day. Even during the slower seasons of Seward the Sea Life center was an enjoyable stop. My favorite attractions was the underwater viewing sections. We got to see puffins swimming under water! It was also amazing to really grasp how big the sea lions are when viewing them practically a glass panels distance from you! It also makes for some cool photos too.

I highly recommended this as a place to visit year round and for all ages. Exhibits were very kid friendly. There is a touch tank too!"
10100,The food was very good and they donate a percentage of their earnings to the first responders/fire department. The people were so nice and it didn't take long at all for it all being made right their in front of you
10101,Michael's and hot topic. There isnt much of a mall there.
10102,"They are so amazing!! I'm involved in every step of Vinny's care, including a post-op picture! They are lifesavers for sure. He had an allergy emergency that I did not know how to handle and guided me thru it seamlessly."

From what I saw, the ambiance is great.  As for the pizza, it is quite delicious.  $20 for a medium specialty."

10166,"Can't speak for sales but the service department is laughably bad and fraudulent.  Told me I needed a new AC compressor that I literally just had replaced a week before. They must not have even looked because the whole engine was dirty except for a shiny new compressor. They tried to screw over my parents, multiple co-workers, and friends. Trust me and ovoid if possible."

Their halibut was decent but not anything to rave about. I'm definitely looking forward to trying most of their menu items. My mouth is watering when I go through their drive thru and see all their food!"

10192,To start the service was excellent! We were met and immediately seated. While perusing the menu we were offered some Miso soup. Being that i love sushi I decided to give it a try. I went with the Fuji Yama Maki. It is served with a fattier tuna and avacodo inside and lean tuna on top. Excellent choice if you want to get a feel for the quality of fish they use here. Overall a great experience. Will be coming here regularly!

Would definitely recommend, professional and a customer service focused company."

If you are looking for paint, Deanna is the sweetest, and always helpful."

10200,"It was pretty good, but my friend had grit in her regular burger..."
10201,"Its convenient, due to winter conditions. It doesnt get everything; however they have a microfiber station. Which I recommend due to your doors freezing shut. Get out and wipe down your doors.
If you get the subscription, you can wash your car daily."

10204,"I had my garage unit heater serviced due to the pilot light not lighting/keeping lit.  Extreme heating came out, were on-time, and did a thorough job of fixing the issue.  My technician was thorough, honest, and took his time to ensure the problem was fixed (by cycling the heater) before he left.  He also noticed that the air filters on my furnace were in dire need of replacement and replaced them free of charge.  This company is very honest in their pricing, their service and ethics.  I was very impressed with everything and will be calling them again."

10242,So many animals me and my family had a great time
10243,"The food and drinks were great! We ordered the new wild north lemonade and an arctic warrior American ale. My husband ordered an all American cheese burger, while I ordered a mushroom burger with a beyond meat patty."
10244,Don't really like eggs benediction but the crab was well seasoned and the bisquits got hard r the longer I waited to eat it and the potatoes we're somewhat sweet Porto chips somewhat soft so the meal was inconsistant

10246,So friendly! Food was amazing!
10247,Bottomless steak fries!!!
10248,"Better than expected, it isn't a super Walmart by any means, but it's good for what it is. The store doesn't sell anybfresh produce but it has everything else you'll need."
10249,"I'd give them 0 stars if I could.  I was looking for something that the app said they had 7 of in stock.  It didn't have an aisle or bay listed for it's location.  I asked 2 people, a younger gentleman and an older blonde lady.  They looked it up on their handheld scanner and then acted as if I didn't even exist.  They started wandering around i thought looking for the part but that was not the case.  2 minutes go by and they're both nowhere to be found.  Without saying a single word to me.  They vanished.  I expressed my disgust by putting all the other items I was going to purchase back and left the store. Upon leaving I saw the blonde lady helping someone else on the computer.  Not a single word did she say to me.  I will never return to this store.  I considered returning to say something to the managers, i'm willing to bet that the managers don't care which is why this behavior exists in the first place.  I've had better customer service with TSA.

I went to the one on Penland Parkway and the whole attitude of the store was different.  People were friendly and helpful."
10250,"Great atmosphere, food, and beer.  I would suggest to anyone.  The price is reasonable."

10256,Good food.  Has a lot of healthy selections.
10257,"I stopped by today to get an estimate for a repair of a large scratch on my fender. The man I spoke with sent me to another place, where, he said, I could get what I need done for less. Wow. What business does that kind of thing? Not many. The man was also very informative and spent at least 10 mins sharing some of his knowledge with me.  Superior customer service. If I ever have to get a big auto body job done, I will go to Mirage, and not one of the more visible (and way too snobbish) auto body shops."
10258,They serve a nice bowl of oatmeal.
10259,Good food
10260,"All the food I've tasted so far, I loved all of it. So far my favorites are Lau Lau, Kahlua pig, kalbi ribs and definitely the house made Mac salad. They make all the sauces in house. The waiter and waitresses are all very polite and helpful. It's a great family atmosphere to take friends and family."
10261,"Great theater, bigger and more variety than dimond. (Although i still love going there)"
10262,"Great restaurant for most anything, especially late night or any time. Only sit down diner style shop that is open 24x7."
10263,"My breakfast was disappointing. Limp greasy bacon, barely warm eggs and disappointing home fries. My husbands french fries tasted like dirty oil. Definetly needing to change that fry oil!!  All around I am being generous with two stars."
10264,"For Ketchikan, this is one of the best places I found.  The menu is extensive and over 6 weeks of working in Ketchikan, I tried quite a few things.  They were all pretty good and the portions were huge.  It's usually pretty busy and there were times that service was slow, but also times that the service was great.  Overall, it's a great find in Ketchikan, which is probably my least favorite Alaska town."
10265,they are sorta mean over there. That drove me away. Food is good people are not so nice
10266,It's Carl's Jr. I enjoy the western bacon cheeseburger. Fast and friendly service.
10267,Awesome selection and great prices on fresh fish.
10268,"Honest , reliable , affordable and so fast .. I was in by 9 and out driving again by Noon ! Crank seal and i have a Ford Taurus.. both notorious for being a pita! The owner is friendly and the staff is knowledgeable. Overall the best experience I have had with a mechanic since my father."
10269,"Pizza slices were generously sized, but somewhat tasteless and slightly burned on the bottom."
10270,"Service is Slooooow.  Took forever to be seated even with five open tables. Go to the one uptown not the one by JBER.  You would think they would be better prepared on a Saturday.

12/12/2019 came in for breakfast and was greeted by this little critter, the receptionist seemed unfazed."
10271,"This pool has areas for everyone. A wading area, diving area and shallow areas. It also has two water slides. The life guards are very safety conscious and patient with the kids, but do in force the rules with authority as they should.  The locker room and shower area were clean. Electric, mounted on the wall hair dryers were also nice."
10272,"Every time I come here it‚Äôs something new. They‚Äôve messed up my order a few times and service is slow. Just recently asked about salads because there‚Äôs none on the drive-thru menu, the guy got an attitude because I asked if they still sold them. Really I can‚Äôt ask a question without you being rude?? Then after I left I noticed they didn‚Äôt put any dressing in the bag or sauce for my nuggets. Wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if this was the first time it happened, it‚Äôs been a common occurrence."
10273,"I really enjoyed my burrito.  Unfortunately, there isn't a Qdoba where I live and I try to eat here when I am in the area.  Being able to choose my ingredients makes it taste the best to me.

They now have fully meatless options."
10274,Good fast service but like everything in Alaska it's expensive!
10275,"It was ok. Except their ""always cooked fresh at 6am"" cinnamon rolls hadn't even been started and we got there at 8... The meal I decided to get was decent though"
10276,Great prices with or without a membership
10277,"Food is good, price is fair"

10287,Standard walmart. Got in what I needed and got out.
10288,"Enjoyed the food and the service,  had a pork quezadilla. That was delicious, fresh salsa bar made the food even better but not needed.  Would go again for sure."

10303,Great service! Helped me pick out an amazing pair of shoes! They even recorded me running on a treadmill to see how the shoes helped me run
10304,If you enjoy good Mexican food this is the place to go. Great staff too!
10305,Alaskan family owned and operated.  Always friendly service and yummy menu items. Your 'Diner favs' with some family twists‚ô°
10306,Great bar close to base...even provides a DD service!
10307,"Spacious Beechcraft 1900C's. The A&P on duty was nice enough to let me get some shots for our charter next week. Of course  they have their gripes like any other airline, but their service has been nothing but helpful the last few months."
10308,This store is ok. Pretty good prices but not a great selection.
10309,Class top to bottom! Definitely bucket list!
10310,It's the only cinema that shows new releases within 100 miles (maybe more)
10311,Love it!
10312,"Located in the Uptown Motel in Kenai, AK it is the stopping place. It was packed and is well known by locals and hunters alike. We had about a 20 min. wait. Portions are big, so prepare to take a box home with you. Lots of taxidermy on the walls. No photos to post for this review."
10313,Clean n great service
10314,They helped me with my specific tastes and hooked me up with just the right juice.
10315,"Friendly staff, good quality parts and equipment. I love this place, like a candy store for engineers or techs. Thanks guys!"
10316,"(Translated by Google) Fair, for the price you pay you got some food.

10317,The best
10318,Love this place
10319,"Finally found that place up here in Anchorage that makes a REAL sub!!!  The subs here are phenomenal and are hard to beat. I used to be very biased and only liked my Jersey Mike's subs but after I tried the Superbowl, I was pleasantly surprised!!!  10/10 would recommend to anyone that loves a real sub sandwich!!!"
10320,Nice place
10321,Great place for events.
10322,"Bueno que puedo decir de cada compa√±√≠a de cerveza que visito son super cada una diferente decoraci√≥n y cervezas. Lo que puedo decir es que tristemente la atenci√≥n no es la misma en 56 que he visitado. Me encanto anchorage porque se define en su decoraci√≥n, te hace sentir como quieres estar en una cervecer√≠a me encanto esas mesas entre los tanques o sea eres participe de ese entorno sientete como un probador de cerveza y disfruta la decoraci√≥n, la atenci√≥n y los aperitivos.....Las Ipas son mi pasion
..super mi tercera brewery en decoraci√≥n en Alaska muy original"
10323,Its tacos!
10324,Parts department
10325,Love $5 Friday's
10326,"Movie experience was acceptable, The seats were not bad, however the counter people were not expedient, they were out of basics like red vines, I was accused of not paying just after I had paid with a credit card, and had to display my receipt, and kids were jumping in-and-out of chairs during the movie."
10327,Love the selection
10328,Being open 24/7 is awesome due to NEVER knowing when u might run outüôÇüëç
10329,"Friendly staff, reasonable and competitive prices, and good pizza. Next time I'm hungry at the mall, I will definitely consider stopping by here again."
10330,I was told my oil change wpuld be 25 minutes.. i waited one hour and 20 minuets before i had keys in hand and was able to pay for my service. I was very Disappointed
10331,Book trip 9 months ago and told u that their boat engine was not working just three days before the trip while we have already been travelling and could not do much to change our travel plan!
10332,"Great food, great service, quality menu."
10333,Bought my flowers from here and my Mr. Avocado the staff there also gave me pointers
10334,Service is ok.
10335,Always great
10336,"Home made buns, hand cut fries.   Best burgers and fries in Anchorage.   But be warned:  It really is a saloon.  Kids are welcome, but I don't think I'd take my grandkids.  Too bad for them. GREAT burgers!"
10337,Good pressure..lots of soap
10338,"(Translated by Google) It's a great adventure

Es una gran aventura"
10339,Usual Walmart
10340,Very friendly and good food
10341,Loved it
10342,Love.the meatball marinara
10343,"What a place. Drunk people sit and the bar and sing full volume at 11:30am on a Tuesday like the weekend never ended. If that's your style, this is place for you. If that's not your style you should probably find somewhere else to get your drinks. But even if that isn't your style it's totally worth stopping in for their out-of-this-world garlic fries. The rest of their food is pretty mediocre. I really just go for the fries."
10344,It was closed and it seemed like a lovely use of space and recycled materials.
10345,Good deals on designer clothes for kids
10346,Very beautiful area that has it all if you are an outdoor activities enthusiast you need to check out this are of Alaska. You will not find a better way to to see Alaska. Fishing is great as was the hiking and the sites and scenery speak for themselves.  Must see if you are in Alaska you will not be disappointed.
10347,Great place to find everything you need. From groceries to outdoor sporting goods.
10348,"Great prices, great work. And she was friendly"
10349,"I want to like this diner. I want to love this diner, because it is my new local diner. However, the food is extremely bland and greasy. I've tried 5 times now to love them and it isn't even a chance at liking. The service is mediocre at best, the pies taste like something from a grocery store freezer, not something homemade. The breakfasts are over greasy and everything tastes like the grill, no individual flavors to enjoy. The meatloaf, which is a personal favorite, definitely needs improvement. Denali Diner or Windbreak are still my go to diners."
10350,Love this place...staff is always fun and polite ! Corn fritter fridays are awesome ! Fish and chips tasted excellent although more chips than fish which was a disappointment for the price
10351,"Everyone here is so friendly and good at what they do.
The office is aesthetically pleasing and works with billing third party.
Definitely recommend if you need an adjustment.
They do offer massage as well."
10352,Try to apply hopefully they hire me Angela Idzinski
10353,"Has what you need, kinda dirty"

10355,Awesome food and service
10356,People are helpful and friendly.
10357,Friendly people. Good product has oil point system is awesome
10358,"Great Hike! Small but decent trailhead (like most of the state kept trails). Low elevation gain, most of it is done while driving to the trailhead so that's a plus. Early fall is a great time to go, everything is getting the fall colors and it's not so thick. Trail ends after about six miles in at a rocky hill with two lakes one on the left (the very light blue) and one to the right (the more royal blue colored one). The start of the trail you are within a little but of trees but the rest of it your above so there are only a few small clusters of them."
10359,"Food was cold and my desert was not fully cooked, I was eating batter. I had the waiter take it back and he just added more ice cream to it, so I was now eating cold batter"
10360,"Kenai Fjords is a remarkable park. If you are traveling through Alaska, and you find yourself in Anchorage or Seward, with a couple of days to spare, it is most definitely worth the trip down the Seward Highway, through the Chugach National Forest to visit this majestic park, which is full of trails and kayaking opportunities."
10361,"The best pet place.  Awesome people who know what's up. Easy no hassle,  home feel.  Lots of what you need (or want) plus more. Stop in,  you'll be happy you did!"
10362,"We've enjoyed the Lighthouse Bakery every time we've been in. Their fish and chips are very good. They have a light breading on the fish which I prefer to the half fish half bread kind.
Their coffee drinks have been wonderful and their peanut butter cookies are so yummy! They are soft!
The cheese quesadilla was not my favorite simply because all of the shredded cheese was not melted and the grease content was kind of high but the fries are really good.
If you're in to Indian food they have a buffet Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening. It was kind of random for a bakery but I hear theirs is really good.
Would definitely visit again!"
10363,"Great, great food. So far the best burgers in Ketchikan. Double party, Beecher cheese, onions. So good. We had both the 108 and Cowboy burger. I tried the truffle fries that were good but the plain fries were excellent as well. They don't have a kids menu written down but he offered to make anything for my toddlers. I ordered them two chicken strips, which were big and crunchy. Both kids are more than I was expecting. The drinks were also fun. I ordered the smoked cocktail which he did at the table, my daughter popped the bubble and was so excited. Loved the decorations as well. Only two improvements our burger buns were slightly cold and would love to see some kind of flat service in the restroom to change diapers as right now they only have a extra chair in one of the restrooms."
10364,"I mean the food is decent, I wouldn't call it amazing, it will do the job, the staff sometimes look like they really don't want to be there but they are friendly regardless, they get 4 stars because the opened up to online orders which makes it amazing for someone like me, I can order and go pick up it up from the table with minimal interactions with people."
10365,Great venue for parties of 40+ upstairs in the banquet room
10366,Great prices
10367,Great place  to watch a movie
10368,"Good food, great selection, nice people. The food comes out hot and freshly made, no sitting under a heat lamp. They have a good variety of entrees to choose from and they're all delicious. Take out, dine in, or delivery."
10369,"Food was fine. Service in typical fairbanks style. Took an hour to get entr√©es in the half empty restaurant because the ""kitchen was slammed."" Sat with dirty app plates and empty drinks for 45 minutes while we waited. Going on 15 waiting for the check. Fries were good."
10370,"Staff is always friendly! Our charter would be in rough shape if we didn‚Äôt have this local store to maintain our boats! Thanks guys, and gals!"
10371,Bad.
10372,Good service during the Covid-19 Hoax.
10373,GREAT BURGER! BOTTOMLESS FRIES.  NOT PRICED LIKE WENDYS BUT GOOD ATMOSPHERE MEANS MORE MONEY I GUESS. üòÜ lol

10392,"I've been taking my vehicles here for almost 3 years now. Donnie has always taken good care of me. They're easy to work with, very knowledgeable and they do not try to b.s. you into work that doesn't actually need to be done. 10/10 would and have recommend to anyone."
10393,"Good place for cold beer, good music and good people."
10394,Love this place

10429,Market spice tea is awesome!
10430,Marisa is amazing!
10431,Good food and always fresh. Owner is top notch and always there to oversee the work is done right during busy hours. Owner also donates his time and money back to the community. Menu has a wide variety from fish sandwiches to foot long hotdogs to top notch corn fritters. It takes a little time for food to be made but because it's fresh it's worth the wait. Good place to go if you're a visitor.
10432,No frozen drinks. Very crowded.
10433,"Third visit and so
Pleased with the service!  Gina and Chelsea were so efficient and kind.
No anxiety minimal and discomfort.  The dentists themselves Dr. Moon,

Friends"
10434,"I have taken two trips with Kultina Salmon Charters and have a had a great time both with them both times.   The guides are very friendly and know how to land big fish.   Matt one of their guides is one of the best fishing guides I gone with in a long time.   He dam near jumped off a cliff to net a big king for me!

They also have a pretty great campground."

10446,It's a sports bar.
10447,Great place
10448,"Food was okay, the waiter forgot all about my husband's drink until 45 minutes after we had already ate all our food. Than she disappeared for 25 minutes or so, we walked up to pay than she noticed us. Won't be going back there. You can probably make better food at your house."
10449,Creamers field has a lot of history. An old dairy farm. Now it's a great place to go on a stroll through the woods or just watch the cranes and other migratory birds.. Creamers field also hosts a crane festival every August.

10467,Good place to get lunch or dinner. Service can be hit or miss but is generally pretty decent.

10469,Love them
10470,Friendly staff. I wish I knew the employees name that looked..and found my Bluetooth ear buds and tucked them away for me. Thank you again!

10473,Very good ladies that know their business about getting your system back on track.
10474,Has many mobile homes
10475,"The tour was an amazing experience, and the farm is beautiful.

The tour guide was humorous and informative. We started with feeding the reindeer, then saw the bison and baby yak. There was also a baby moose, and the tour ended with looking at and feeding elk.

The tour lasted around 45 minutes, and we learned a lot of basic information about these animals."
10476,"Great selection of Mexican food. Located in a good, central part of downtown Juneau. Good service."

10480,Awesome
10481,"Amazing, I have been a patient for over a year now, the Staff and Dr Musa are masters of their crafts. Every aspect of care has been seamless and precise.

I have gone to other pain management providers in anchorage and Algone far surpasses the quality of care provided by a long shot. I can now live my life with minimal  pain thanks to Dr Musa.

My family cannot thank you enough for your professionalism, compassion, and expert knowledge."
10482,Want to watch seaplanes land & take off? This is your spot.

10489,"Long story short they lied about my account being closed and paid up, then failed to call me, then failed to notify me by mail after I gave them my updated address so I ended up getting a call from a collection agency many months later- GCI apparently failed to call me as well during that time. Terrible"
10490,"I work by here and love this place. There protein smoothie is amazing. If one girl whose new makes it though doesn't taste right. To watery. But over all love there breakfast, avacados toast, and juices. Will return"
10491,Very nice people. They listened and did my nails the way I wanted them done. Great atmosphere.
10492,So so

10494,Took a bit for the food to come out
10495,"I love their breakfast which is pretty much the only thing I eat here. Also, McDonald's Coke is the best in the world, plus its inexpensive. The location is good, right on my way to work. The facility is maintained and kept clean. The food is always hot and service is usually very fast. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the drive thru line can get ridiculously long at times during the day. Wish they could somehow speed that up."
10496,Great donuts
10497,I mostly order there Roast beef sandwich.
10498,Sweet little lady had procedure done on her ear. Fantastic staff! Not too costly

10504,"Fair prices, good organization, nice staff, make sure everyone wares gloves, the system and how they operate was awesome. Sometime out of stuff and sell some rotten stuff (well it wholesale) you better look and choose the good one."
10505,Price price price!
10506,"The cabins are quaint, and are not going to win any beauty contests, but they have what you need. The views are spectacular, the lodge staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating. The worst part was having to leave this beautiful place."
10507,We called this company because of drainage problems over an extended period of time.. they came in diagnosed the issue and jumped into repairing the problem fast organized and so efficient  from beginning to end.

The staff was extremely helpful and put my mind at ease that my dog was going to be well taken care of. They had no problems with me texting and asking for pictures, of Barkley, throughout the time that he was there. Great place.‚Äù"
10515,Brunch Burger!
10516,It is ok
10517,Levi was extremely helpful in addressing my tree concerns. Very knowledgeable and attention to detail.  Work was performed in a timely fashion with a crew second to none. Would recommend
10518,Staff was helpful and we picked up a doggy bed
10519,"They are really friendly and have good recommendations if you domt know what your looking for, other then that they are well staffed and attended to you quick whether or not you checked in online. Love my haircut"
10520,Quick and easy walk in ready!
10521,I love breakfast at Oasis. The crab eggs Benedict is amazing. You can get half portions for lighter appetites. They had blueberry coffee available from North Pole Coffee too. Soooo good. Friendly staff too.
10522,They have awesome canned smoked salmon.
10523,Great clean store
10524,I they do good on trying to get families in housing
10525,Good taco salad
10526,They have a nice small exhibit here about the wild animals. The restaurant next to it is pretty good too.
10527,"Sometimes, a national chain is a national chain because they are doing something right. That is the case with this wings place.

What tasty morsels you can get here, folks! I have been here about a dozen times now and the wings have always been crisp on the outside, yet on the inside moist and fresh.  The meat is never dried out!

I have tried several of the varieties of wings here, but my favorite is the lemon pepper. All of the ones I have had were very good, so don‚Äôt hesitate to order your favorite flavors. But in my case, it‚Äôs all about the lemon pepper.

The rolls are pretty good, but the side item I like best is the mini corn on the cob! Juicy and delish! Also never dried out!

Added bonus: if you come in here enough, they  remember you and even know your order! It‚Äôs really nice to go to a place where everyone really does know your name! Makes you feel like you are in old time Anchorage again."
10528,Very helpful
10529,didn't really like that michelle had forgotten the wrap towel and then forgot the astringent that your supposed to put on after the wax. then she was my pedicurist. nice atmosphere very relaxing. I guess i had three missed appointment i have never been sent an email or anything on the matter. so when you have three missed appointments theres a 50% surcharge before the appointment. They have an  a tea thats so deliscious it doesnt need  any sugar. They also have coffee and vanilla creamer. I went in for a  buttox wax. They have a towel and wipes on the table.  No pain. I was told by another waxer to put oil on the area an hour before and  your wax should be virtually painless. When you walk up the stairs on the firts room rifht right  wjen you walk into the waxing roo. If you look to the roght theres some purple hair dye and it looks like some wax stuck on the wall by the front right corner of the wall. The waxer told me that sje told Allure they need to repaint the walls
10530,"Always great.  Food, customer service, atmosphere!!"

10538,This store has so many European foods I love & many items you just can't get at regular grocery stores.
10539,"Nice glacier. Go there in the evening, when its less crowded."
10540,"Beautiful location.  Only parked for the day, it was nice to be able to get so close to the shore."

10543,Great place for lunch and tastey burritos
10544,"Too pricey for the meal you get, staff is professional but not in the best of moods in the mornings! We were there for breakfast."
10545,Great food great service. Our waiter was awesome. Will be going back.
10546,Such a cool old building. It seemed very well maintained and had lots of space for the event I attended.
10547,Suuuper easy to get my new car. Shawn helped me through all the paperwork and took the time to explain to me the math and got me the best possible outcome for my loan. Thanks guys!!

10558,Really cool. Never expected to ever be able to see a living Snow Leopard but they had 2 there!
10559,"Pikes is a great place to have a drink. Sitting outside by the river on a nice day is great. My wife and had several drink and they were excellent!

The food we ordered was a different story. My wife ordered a medium steak and received it very well done. I ordered chicken tenders and they were over cooked as well.

I can't say that I will eat there again, but the drinks are terrific."
10560,Ok food. Indifferent service
10561,"A place for everyone here. Community focused, Christ centered."
10562,Great place!
10563,"Love the view ,,,sad the walking trail is getting overgrown"

10565,"We decided to take our 2 year old here because he is obsessed with dinosaurs. He enjoyed running around and looking at the few dinosaurs they had but we all grew bored after about 20 minutes. There is a ""dig site"" in the back for kids but we didn't partake. The staff is very friendly & allowed our little guy to roam the museum with the stuffed toys he found in the gift shop. I thought the price for 2 adults was kind of steep for the amount of material to look at & time spent inside. Our little one does however want to go back to get more dinosaur toys!"
10566,Fast and friendly
10567,"I own a saab and come here for most things I need. The guys know what they are doing and what they got themselves into (each have a knowledge that works together). They don't seem to mind my kids there and are friendly to them. When I ask questions they dont use layman terms, they talk like they do to other mechanics and such lol. So I love that.
I recommend giving them a shot"
10568,It's the only makeup store in town
10569,Great food even better prices and the food is always cooked pretty fast great local Mexican place
10570,"Great people, great service."
10571,Gorgeous
10572,"Always a good time there, good food!"
10573,Delicious as always. Customer service was excellent as well!
10574,It's okay. A bit over hyped and priced for the quality of the food.
10575,Great food!! Locals love this place so it is usually crowed
10576,Scrumptious fresh donuts in creative flavors
10577,"As usual I was completely satisfied. This place pulls out all the stops from atmosphere, service to food and price. Well worth the drive from anywhere in the municipality! Loni was a fantastic server with perfect recommendations and smile."
10578,These guys are so awesome because one of them changed some tail lights for me.
10579,I prefer Subway or Pita Pit. But ok in a pinch.
10580,Great place to study or hang out!
10581,"The food is always awesome, but the music is always way too loud.. Last visit felt like we had to yell at each other just to talk!"
10582,Great store

10590,Still the best burgers in town.
10591,"We made the trip to Fairbanks just to visit the Santa Claus House (Dec 22-23). I must say that I was very disappointed that it didnt feel like xmas, at all. In my mind I thought they'd have a large open space, decorated with xmas lights/decorations, for the kids to be out in the snow. The parking lot was small and dark and the store had little to no lighting around it. There was no light shining on the large Santa, in the front, so we couldnt take any good pics. I really thought they'd make an effort to make it look like Christmas inside and out since its supposed to be Santa's House, after all, but they didnt. There were no xmas lights anywhere. The only lighting was to the front, of the store, to show the facade. Going inside, I thought it'd feel like xmas too (cozy with warm feelings and all). It didnt!! It looked like any other gift shop except this one is filled with xmas ornaments (ranging from a few bucks to over $1000). Its pretty crowded, enough to make me paranoid about accidentally bumping into a shelve and breaking something, especially when we're all wearing our huge winter clothes. I didnt even enjoy myself because I had my 3 and 5 yr old children who I had to keep super close to me and under eagle eye supervision because the store is filled with expensive ornaments on the bottom shelves where kids can easily reach and break them. Not sure why anyone would call a place Santa Claus House and make NO attempt to make it kid-friendly. Its almost like they purposely planned for children to NEVER come inside. Unless its a business strategy ""lets fill this store with expensive breakables, call it something kid-friendly to trick parents into bringing their children, and maybe they'll break lots of things so the parents are forced to buy them"". If so, I guess it works. ü§£
Oh, I almost forgot... the only space for children was a 2 adult bench that was situated 4 feet from a wall-hung TV, that played the Polar Express movie. In other words, a max of 7 SMALL children (toddlers) could fit in this space (3 on the bench and 4, on the floor, at the feet of the 3 benched children). Again, no planning whatsoever since the TV was up high (about 5-6 feet from the ground) so the floor children had to bend their little necks to watch the movie.
The only thing I enjoyed was being able to buy deeds to own a square inch of the North Pole (still not sure if theyre real but super cute). I also liked how Santa was there but we didnt get a chance to take a photo because they werent accepting any more people. We showed up around 4:30pm and they said they had enough people, on the wait list, to last them until closing (6:30pm). They did mention that its never busy at opening (10am) so we planned to go back the next morning. We got there at about 10:30am and we still waited about 1.5 hrs. I guess you have to be there before opening time so you can be the first in line. I guess I hadnt noticed, on the first day, that Santa didnt have much of his own space. Like everything else in the store, Santa's space was very crowded too. His space backed up into another aisle filled with ornaments. I guess they dont make more of an effort because it IS free to have your photo taken. Note: you have to bring your own camera but they do have an employee that takes the photo for you. Also NOTE: the employee taking the photo is no professional. She cut the feet off our photo so it looked a little awkward. Overall, it's definitely not a trip worth making (unless youre really into xmas ornaments) if this is all you plan on doing. You'd be better off visiting a mall Santa!! At least, there, your kids are more free to roam."
10592,Good prices
10593,Nice and friendly atmosphere..
10594,Staff was nice. There cars aren't the cleanest on the inside. Need better detailing compared to other Chevy dealerships I've been to.
10595,Great service!
10596,Very good
10597,Bigger than the Anchorage stores
10598,Over priced and not the greatest tasting coffee.
10599,Refreshing ride. Quiet. Great venue to take visiting family and out of town folks.  Purchase tickets during advertised specials.  Expensive.
10600,I was great fun took pics rode the slide
10601,"Service was excellent, food was good, and all employees were very friendly."
10602,Fast service
10603,"Good short trail for kid, need to pay adult $10, kid $5."
10604,Got me in fast and with the best deal I could get
10605,Great place to take a walk with the kids.
10606,The good place to walk your kids walking wife walking dog. Don't feed ducks It's bad form bad for the environment Bad for the species  That's all I am gonna say about that.

10612,Good coffee and cakes
10613,"It was pretty dead even during ""busy hours""  kinda a ghost town here :/"
10614,Lots of people in line means they know what they're doing
10615,The people were very nice. The food was delicious and arrived quickly. The restaurant has been remodeled nicely and is very clean. This restaurant will definitely be added to our places to take friends.
10616,"Out of the way, different and tastes great! One of the least expensive places to eat with normal goodness. Great friendly service. Though I did choose to buy drinks elsewhere at two bucks a pop for soda in a can!"
10617,Love Arby's new face lift. Looks great. Plus they have a lot of new meals on the menu.
10618,Just gorgeous
10619,Nice place
10620,Quick service on my return. Only one of the doors was open. Lots and lots of stuff on sale but I felt some of it was priced cheaper online.
10621,"Trails here are top notch, but they need more parking. on a nice summer day the parking lot can get completely full, including the overflow."
10622,so affordable
10623,Great view
10624,AIH staff we're friendly and helpful... They answered all questions that I had. About a power washer.Even went online to see if they could order a certain part..
10625,Overpriced and not worth it  Try  BIG  Boy
10626,Informed.
10627,Helpful and happy staff.  They do a lot with the limited budget afforded to them.
10628,I‚Äôve bought many things from here over the years. Everything they have is quality and the prices are fair. I don‚Äôt even look at used trailers because guys want money for old trailers that can almost get you a brand new one that you have a huge selection to pick from.
10629,One of the best Fred's to shop at. Deli was fresh and customer service fast and professional.
10630,Yummy
10631,"Went here specifically for the fish tacos.
They have their very own special blend seasoning that you can purchase.

Served with red cabbage, sauce and amazing.

They also have several beers on tap and a full liquor license.

Looks like the views are awe inspiring during daylight per the chalet style windows.

Great service from Nelton. On point.
Looking forward to going back."
10632,Excellent Italian food!!! We are NEVER disappointed! Outstanding customer service. Love Sorrentos!
10633,Beautiful and magnificent scenery
10634,Food was cold
10635,Because it exists!
10636,"Extremely courteous, dedicated to continual improvement of his businesses and himself, and genuinely cares about his customers. My entire family are glad we had the pleasure of finding him nearly three years ago!  - Thanks Marquise!"
10637,Low quality ingrediants. More like an air sandwich. A lot of day old bread and very little meat and cheese.
10638,Great place to shop and find great things to eat
10639,Love this place
10640,Nice little galley of local Alaskan artists. Good diverse selection at reasonable prices. Will visit again.
10641,My friend and I both enjoyed our meal very much. The staff was attentive but not overbearing. Our food arrived in a timely manner. Iam picky about giving 5 stars. I really enjoyed myself.
10642,NICE
10643,Good quality merchandise and fair price. Visited on Sunday & thought it was a bit short on staff.
10644,Quaint little hotel with friendly staff. Small rooms but there's a little legroom üòä office hours are 8am-8pm
10645,"The best hikes around fairbanks that are also very kids friendly for training you and your kids, plus they have wonderful events held through Facebook for you and your avid child hiker and nature seeker!"
10646,"I'm a member here for now.  What is hard to justify is continuing when the aerobic equipment is so poorly maintained.  The location is great for me and staff pleasant but if a club were to open with a better maintenance schedule, I'd have to move."
10647,"The service was the best I've had from any restaurant, and the food was INCREDIBLE"
10648,What a view.
10649,"Love the pho, and very cool environment."
10650,Good
10651,Not the place to go for a meal (unless you're vegan).  But the coffee and atmosphere are okay.
10652,"I've been here twice in the past week, mainly because it's the only option past security for food besides Starbucks and vending machines.  On the 1st visit, the tiny $7.50 bowl of chicken noodle soup was no better than a can of soup, maybe worse and probably smaller. And the staff were completely inattentive.  On the 2nd visit, the ""Gastro Burger"" patty was small, overcooked, and appeared to have been frozen, despite The Local's claim to use the freshest, and most local sourcing available for their produce and meats.  And I hope you don't like fries with your burger, because your spuds come in chip form only here. This place has the slick marketing down, but fails to deliver anything approaching decent food.  If you can wait to eat in Fairbanks or at your destination, you'll be happier."
10653,Very good honest shop.
10654,Always have what I need! Friendly staff.
10655,Shopping here is a lot of fun
10656,Monster car wash!!!! Great job!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ

10660,Great service
10661,Not the nicest mall but definitely seems to be steadily improving since sears moved out
10662,Nice large park
10663,"First thing I noticed is it smelled like stale beer. The coffee was thin and watery and no butter or cream cheese for the muffin ordered . The tables were sticky and wobbled .
Consider other options ."

10670,Very good Mexican cuisine with an excellent salsa bar
10671,"Great deals here, I love that they deliver until 1:30-2am!"
10672,"One of the best restaurants in Anchorage! Try the artichoke & crab dip, asiago parmesan crusted halibut & a scratch margarita or lavender cosmo!"
10673,"It's a gorgeous McDonald's one of the best I've seen.   But the food is blah.   So McDonald's is McDonald's, but all fast-food in town has a cardboard taste.  Im sure it has to due with how things are shipped up here. Letting the tourists know so they aren't surprised."
10674,Great selection of Candy!
10675,They are always responsive when I have a question and helpful when I needed to make changes to fit my budget better but not sacrifice coverage.
10676,Everything I need !!!
10677,Such a cool and awesome store filled with all that boys and men can have fun with outside
10678,"Small museum with historical artifacts.  Very good, informative 33 minute video.  Really enjoyed that.  Small gift shop.  Sled dog puppies available to hold.  Also have adult team of dogs pulling a wagon ..... rides are $10 per person."
10679,"Great place, rocks and bones, jewelry much more. Lots of things you won't find in any store."
10680,It's fast food
10681,Best yet
10682,Decent. But they dont allow concealed or open carry.
10683,So beautiful scenery.
10684,They mess up the order here and there but other than that it's pretty good.
10685,"Ian is the best server!  The entire staff is nice.  Our 7 year-old has declared, ""Ian is the nicest worker!"""
10686,Good food and affordable  !!!!!
10687,Nice staff
10688,Just about everything that you need.
10689,"Worked at Cooper Landing two summers. Made it a point to drive to Sterling just to eat at Magpye's.
Excellent !! Well worth the drive !!"
10690,Another selection of goods to chose from. Nothing that sets the store apart from anything else locally.
10691,"I was extremely disappointed by the service provided. We only ordered beer and still waited 20 minutes to receive it - which we go and ask again to accomplish. Additionally, after during our entire time there, nobody ever checked on our table to see if we needed anything else. I went back to the bar to ask for another beer and waited 15 minutes while they notified the server and waited for him to come to the front...to pour one beer...Finally, I had to request my ticket to pay, which they could not immediately locate and had to create another bill. For all I know, the food may be incredible, but the service is some of the worst I have ever experienced."
10692,Only grocery shopping in town and the selection of meat and produce is okay
10693,"(Translated by Google) The beautiful staff are very friendly and can get most of the items you need. However, the price is a bit more expensive than online.

10695,"Decent playground gear. Soccer fields are well maintained. Has a basketball court. Pavilion available, it can be reserved. Needs a swingset."
10696,Great selection and friendly staff focussed more on helping people find what they're looking for and making sure it will meet their needs than on making the sale. This is not a place that answers your question by sending you to isle 9. They stay with you until you're done.
10697,Ilove their soup. Always  fresh and hot.
10698,Delicious
10699,Great place for many adventures
10700,Awesome pizza jalapeno  papa
10701,Food was way too greasy and too expensive and who puts their pepperonis under the cheese and for $30 I could have went to McDonald's and got greasy food that wasn't soggy on top of that my wife is now sick way too much sauce not enough crust never again will I be going there

10708,Shopping that's all
10709,I read it this visit five stars because of the excellent help that I got was real quick getting through the register on the way out that's the kind of service we need
10710,"Samurai Sushi was the choice for lunch today. This place has been established for quite some time now and has never  displeased. Friendly staff, good sushi and a full menu to choose from. The lunch boxes are great but if your hungry I'd recommend the Samurai Special Lunch. This place is relatively inexpensive but you can easily make that check grow big exponentially.
If your out and about seeking a new lunch place and feel like some far east feast, I recommend giving this place a whirl."
10711,"I had heard this place was hit or miss and that the service really sucked but I wanted to try it out, at first when we walked up there were two girls who looked at me and my boyfriend and they continued to talk like we weren't there and then sat us, not a long wait but they were rude, but then we got a really sweet server (I'm a server and I could tell management haven't taught them basic things I was the first week at my job) but she was good, and very prompt in drinks order ,and the check which was very nice. My boyfriend ordered the halibut tacos and I'm not sure if they were supposed to be cold or warm but they were cold, even the meat. My pasta was barely above room temperature, it wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese on the top, but the spinach artichoke dip was incredible, oh my Lord, id go back just for that, soooo good and the blueberry cheesecake so good, all the food was great but temperature is important and they didn't have it"
10712,Good food
10713,Great food! Great beer! Great atmosphere. Try the Yak quesadilla.  Enough said
10714,Lmao
10715,Great hidden find in downtown Fairbanks!
10716,"I'd give them a -10‚òÜ's if it was possible! I hit a moose, I set up my repair appt and my Geico lady referred me to Enterprise... the lady @ the repair shop said that was close by & a good choice. So, I called ahead and explained to a manager (Eric) that I had special circumstances and needed ground clearance. I was assured that they had me covered. I drove 4hrs on that day, arrived & they had no trucks and nothing with ample clearance.  They wanted to charge me $7 more a day for appx 1in of extra ground clearance in an upgraded vehicle & I opted to take the FORD FOCUS instead. I live down a long bumpy dirt road & if they don't care about their car neither do I! I'd never use them again!!!!

UPDATE: Corporate responded to my feedback asking for more info. I sent it to them & they claimed that they would call me & never did.

They just tried to make it look like they cared about my issue... so that people reading this review would see that they replied.

Another FAIL!"

Pool, sauna, steam room, whirlpool, loads of new cardio machines, two rooms full of free weights and weight machines, a walking track, what more could one ask for? There is a full program of exercise classes, including classes using the pool. They offer personal trainers, tanning rooms and massages. There are courts for basketball, tennis üéæ, handball and racquetball. There are six locker rooms. and  an area for children. They even have treadmills with built-in TVs. You can‚Äôt beat it with  a stick. I got in a 1000 calorie workout today and I feel great!

Love the staff too they‚Äôre always super pleasant."
10734,Great accommodations.
10735,Guys working there are really great people
10736,"The service is prompt and friendly. They have Traditional Turkish Coffee! ü•∞ An all time fave of mine, and they have the Traditional Method of preparing it toboot! I am happy to find that out! I have friends fron Turkey who spoiled me with the ""right"" stuff! üòã"
10737,"Love the staff! Every experience I have had with David's Jewelers has been above and beyond. I am a very clumsy and accident prone person resulting in a lot of damaged jewelry, they fix it for me every time with speed and ease! I can't even tell what happened to my ring.  They also clean with water and not UV on my Morganite jewelry which is a sensitive stone. A+++"
10738,Great service!
10739,"It gets so warm due to the lack of circulation in the building. I stay in the back because the front of the bar allows smoking.
I only go because the bartenders are super nice and I love dancing on their dance floor! (:"
10740,Honestly have gone here far more times than they deserve... The food is sub-par and drinks typically more expensive than most places around town. Really need to revise their menu.
10741,So pretty!!! The flowers are beautiful and the staff is so nice! I love walking around and enjoying the scenery. You can also buy plants here if you'd like which I think really cool!
10742,"Food here is very good.  Wish they would train their servers to pay attention to the customers, then I would come more often.  If you don't get coffee (which they bring with a carafe), you might as well give up on drink refills."
10743,This is generally the best fully automated car wash. The quality of wash isn't 100% consistent but reliably better than others in town. Alaska does a number on cars with mud and snow so no auto-wash is perfect.
10744,What a great stop for wildlife and unique road travel..Thank you Amber for all of your ideas!!
10745,Costco has some of the best prices and selections in town
10746,Chepo's has the best food the best service I love it I drive an hour and a half just to get the mini chimis thanks friends
10747,Love this place. One of the best views on tge way to Girdwood. Definitely worth the stop!

10749,Good customer service!
10750,Halibut tacos and ceviche are SUPERB!
10751,Cute home decor
10752,Parking for maybe 8cars total
10753,The store itself is very convenient and great. If you are not a rewards member you may pay more than you should on some items. Overall excellent store.
10754,Good food and great service
10755,"Was there for an oil change. Great service, in & out in less than an hour.  The only negative thing was that when I pulled up to the Service Dept. There was no place to park, and when I went to leave a Tow Truck blocked me in and the driver would not move. Even though I saw him looking right at me. The good thing for Lithia Hyundai of Anchorage is that the tow truck is not one of theirs."
10756,Service is quick and courteous and food is always hot.
10757,"Good food, very friendly and courteous"
10758,Dirty
10759,"Gallos on Arctic has always been one of our favorite  restaurants.  But tonite we were highly disappointed.   The prices have gone up and the quality tonite was on the verge of terrible.  Sadly, we will need to spend our money elsewhere."
10760,Amazing work and got me in fast. Worked on my 2010 BMW 335i xdrive. Also super friendly and they walk you through all what they do. Also ask before they do anything which is super thoughtful. Come check them out and their be able to get you in. It amazes me that they do import vehicles as well because you know Fairbanks.. it's tough.. and it's way better then going to Anchorage or waiting for ever for an appointment at other places.
10761,So good!
10762,They're doing the best that they can under the circumstances.
10763,Nice little hike!
10764,I usually like Wendy's but the location at Seward Hwy and Northern Lights is terrible.
10765,"The Dimond Center is great! There's all kinds of stores here, a food court, as well as food shops throughout the mall. There's games and activities like ice skating, bowling, and Dave & Busters, a full service movie theater (with AMAZING chairs!), and retair stores galore. From Abercrombie to Best Buy, you're sure to find what you're looking for at the Dimond Center. The mall also employs its own armed security personnel, as well as a staffed APD office for public safety. APD does regular patrols, as well as mall security, in the mall and in the parking lot. I'd lock your doors in the lot for sure though, crime has gotten bad in Anchorage. This is overall a family friendly place, and a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon!"
10766,"The best as always. Milkshake is a must and the Breakfast burnger is my fav though many many just go for the chicken which is pretty amazing chicken. Excellent burger, staff is always fun."

10770,"Ate here a couple times, pizza is ok and I like that you can buy by the slice. Also 2 slices and a pint (of good beer) for $12, hard to beat that  downtown for a meal"
10771,Great shop to stop at for souvenirs of AK. A ways out from Fairbanks but worth trip. They also have an ice cream spot in the store.
10772,Very limited selection prices are higher than I'm used to
10773,Airport
10774,They work very slowly for 45 minutes waiting for my food.
10775,Great food and waiting staff and a wonderful view!
10776,"They do a great job packing and freezing your fish and the best part its YOUR fish. Not what a lot of packaging place do, they will swap pounds to pounds. I like knowing I'm eating what I caught and how fresh it is!"
10777,One of my favorite place to get a vegan burger. The staff is super friendly and it usually isn‚Äôt too busy!
10778,"I highly recommend this store.  There is everything from fishing needs, outdoor needs and plenty of warm clothes to keep you warm.  When going out fishing there are plenty of rod and reel combos to choose from, line spooling available, plenty of handmade lures for saltwater fishing to choose from.  If you need rain gear or muck boots this store has it as well. Very robust selection of goods from rain gear, fishing gear, camping gear and more. Thanks again B&J Sporting Goods."

10785,"Hillside Family Medicine is closed during lunch hours.

If you're looking for a doctor, but you need flexibility due to your schedule then consider Hillside Family Medicine.  I work late hours, so I can only see a doctor near 5 PM or on weekends.  Hillside Family Medicine always does their best to get me an appointment the next day or during that week.  The doctors and employees are very polite.  Plenty of parking, but awkward leaving the parking lot due to adjacent intersection.

10787,"We had out Durango in for routine service and found out that they did not fill the washer fluid or replace the caps on several items under the hood.  We did not realize this until out daughter took her 2500 in to have the studded tires swapped for summer tires.  There were a couple of recalls.  She had an appointment.  First delay - mechanic that was to work on her truck did not come in.  Second delay - now truck has over $4,000 worth of repairs that need to be made - maybe she should just trade it in for a new one!  She was willing to look.  Realized a week later that they had not even started on the truck!!  By this time we had noticed all the issues with the Durango - poor service from the service department - so really did not trust their advice.  Had a quote from another mechanic for 1/3rd the price.  We have been loyal Dodge owners for sometime -- will NOT be using LIthia unless they are the only dealer left in the US!"

10792,Great for big and small dogs to play!
10793,Pizza hut is there. Lunch between 11 and 2
10794,Ate lunch at the restaurant. Upstairs so had a bit of a view. Good food. Good prices. Worth the stop.
10795,New art exhibits on 1st Friday and pickleball on Mondays.
10796,Our first hotel in Fairbanks Alaska..It's a real clean hotel.. Breakfast is not included that's the annoying part...
10797,Excellent lunch option.
10798,"Employees at this airport are unprofessional and rude. My husband and I asked an employee for a cart to help us with our carseats and heavy luggage, because we had two sleeping babies in our hands, and one of the guys leaned against the cart and told us no and turned away. Thats the last time we will use that airport since they dont seem to be family friendly, or just friendly in general."

Very happy with the final outcome and would advise if you had any issue in the store please reach out to the store manager. So glad I did."
10806,"Kitchen staff working in kitchen with no head gear on there head, touching their faces, no gloves on and touching ready-to-eat food with their bare hands, and rags hanging over shoulders. The food was good and service was fast, but I noticed the above while waiting for my food  in their open kitchen"

10811,Amazing!
10812,"Ordered parts for my car, was called and told they were in, picked them up and went to have them installed, turns out they were the wrong parts (front end instead of rear end), they reordered my parts and i was called and told my parts were in a few days later, turns out the wrong parts were ordered again, im still waiting on my parts, $230 i have paid and three weeks later and i still dont have the right parts, never do business with these people, they cant even order parts right."

10821,"Tarn is a true Volvo geek and that is what you want when you turn your baby over to someone for maintenance and repair. We worked with the dealership for years and that's fine, but Independent Auto is fabulous. Flexible, knowledgeable, kind and thoughtful. If they have a used serviceable part on hand, they will offer it (if you want to save some $ and time vs. new parts). They know the quirks of all the makes and models. We are really happy to have found them."
10822,Great Mushroom Burger
10823,Very unhelpful staff.
10824,Prompt and friendly staff. Plenty of TV's to watch any game you are interested in. Great beer and food selection.

10857,Not a lot of people but a lot to hike around and look at.
10858,Best place to buy ammo in anchorage
10859,They did a pretty good job you know getting the tree cut down. They took the brush away and cut the logs in nice lengths. I definitely think they could have cut the stump lower than what they did but it is what it is. There communication was also not the best. Overall good though.
10860,Always have the best prices!!
10861,"Good selection, nice store and a helpful staff.
Plus, best buy is competitive in pricing with Amazon."
10862,"Jerry was awesome. No pressure, addressed me not my boyfriend (car only for me, still polite for my boyfriend but addressed me for all car related decisions), very informative and did his best to work within my budget and wishes.
Mark also awesome. He helped get me extra coverage and stay within my budget.
Everyone friendly and helpful. Relaxed atmosphere."
10863,Drinks are great could have more options for people who don‚Äôt eat meat.

10889,"It‚Äôs disappointing to see how much it costs just to walk on a trail and enjoy one of alaska‚Äôs Natural resources. They even want 10$ for my 1 year old who gets pushed in a stroller.

10892,Often has some good deals can be seen from the road and has two different buses go right by it and another 2 within walking distance.
10893,"I'm new to the area and picked Jenski, at first, because they were a fee dollars cheaper then others. I continue to bring them my business because of Bayli. She is very helpful and makes sure I'm happy with the service. She gets my car in asap and double checks her work. The gentleman at the front desk was very nice and kept checking on me as I was using their free WI-FI in the lobby. They offer rides to and from, if needed, so I didn't have to wait there."

10896,"Re: Denny's @
3950 Debarr Road, Anchorage, Alaska 99508
Saturday, December 14th, 2019 (am)
I've been to many Denny's up and down the west coast from San Diego to Anchorage. Today I went in for breakfast at the address above. I was greeted with a smile before I even got to the front door by a young man who was making sure the front was clean. When I walked in the door a lady halfway across the east room made eye contact with me, smiled and immediately approached me and ushered me to a seat giving me a choice of table or booth. I purposely chose a booth that had sight into the kitchen area. Earlier this year I had a terrible experience at a Denny's in Oakhurst, California so I wanted to observe the people here who would be preparing and serving me food. I wasn't sitting more than 30 seconds before a server approached me with a smile and greeted me and offered to get me beverages. She brought my coffee and lemonade and took my order and gave me helpful suggestions. The restaurant was fairly busy yet my food came rather quickly. It was all delicious. While I ate my breakfast I sat and observed my surroundings. The place was clean, the staff had great attitudes. The teamwork was exceptional. I could see staff high-fiving each other in the kitchen. I saw staff in the dining area happy and laughing with each other and it truly warmed my heart after a stressful week of work. When I was finished eating I took my ticket to the cashier area and was immediately helped and asked how my food was. At that time I asked to speak with the manager but he was unavailable. He had rolled up his sleeves and got in the kitchen to help. Now I am thoroughly impressed by this location. A lady approached and offered to help me. I believe she was the assistant manager. Now a group of staff has gathered with concerned looks. I truly believe they cared. As I told them about my great experience and how awesome they are and how they made me feel I noticed some watery eyes. Again, my experience was exceptional and I truly believe they care and like being hospitable. I am so glad that this Denny's is closest to my home. I hope you will take care of them as they deserve."
10897,Beautiful place to stay!
10898,Nice & comfortable coffee spot & great tea options.
10899,Best store
10900,Amazing tour.
10901,Always be open to new talk
10902,"Great pizza! Great beer.  I just have a feeling that they are really bothered by customers.  Half the decor on one wall is making sure customers know that the don't split checks,  don't complain about long wait times and don't use their Wi-Fi.  Oh and yes they close at 9 but if you order after 830 it has to be take out.   Good food just don't like the machismo/big city vibe."
10903,"I really liked the ticket machines inside the lobby, especially when you are running late.  Clean.  Comfortable seats."
10904,"If you aren't too hungry try out the sliders. Two is perfect for me (my man needs 3).  Also another favorite is the portobello fries, a definite mush try.  If you're in the mood for a burger, you won't be disappointed here!"
10905,Great View
10906,"Awesome staff,Jerry is a true professional"
10907,Java Chip Frappe...enough said!  The pastries are yummy too!

10912,Everything is wonderful and beautiful!
10913,"Beautiful day on water! Finger lake is great for the whole family. Camping, fishing, wading, bird watching or simply enjoying nature."
10914,They deep fry there wings to a crisp and pour sauce on half of them.  Overpriced and poorly done.
10915,The service was top notch!   The food was great!   It didn't take long to get our food and all the staff was friendly throughout our visit
10916,"The food is always great, and so is the service. I always end up spending too much money but it's worth it. Their baked goods are ah-mazing!"

10920,"Great bagels, bright and cheery, Everything Bagels has excellent service with staff and owner caring for you. This is a wonderful place to kick back, relax with friends over a cup of coffee and food."
10921,Was very nice people great service and just good honest food.  Portion sizes are huge so be warned..
10922,Terrible service. Their mozz sticks used to be amazing and homemade and now they are frozen. I asked for my burger to be well done. It was not. My server said no it's well done when it was clearly pink. She said she will bring it back and gave me attitute. Whi argues with a custimer like that? After 15 minutes and didnt get it back i asked for the check. She came back with the check and a new plate and a bigger attitude. I told her i didn't want it and she said well it's here. I asked to speak to the manager and she said well we kind if are all the managers.  It was a terrible dining experience and I'll never go back.
10923,I love this store!
10924,This place is breathtaking if you love the nature and want to get away from it all. Hike for hrs pitch a fire at the campground and just relax. You can get on a boat for some glacia outing bring ur kayaks and just hit the breathtaking waters. Love this place
10925,"Quick, honest, thorough. I had my Subaru tinted here and was not the least bit upset. I would recommend this place to anyone. When i researched getting my windows tinted, they were the cheapest and had military discount."
10926,"lame as hell!! no actual information about alaska in my opinion and i live here.  theirs a empty prebuilt cabin inside, a representation of the northern light(kinda), a tundra scene that should have been updated 20 years ago(they have oil money and grants so theirs no excuse not to) and a gift shop with ""authentic"" native gift....for 40 dollars lol, some pictures of the northern light for sale for 97.00 that arent any better than the one i took with my iphone! its a place to scam tourists out of there time and money and make them think this is the alaska experience. the most culture there is a  bush plane hanging from the celing...no thanks and thanks for the boring afternoon"
10927,"Wings to make your taste buds do backflips, one of the gems here in Anchorage, the deep fried zucchini, service was friendly, fast, very professional."
10928,"""I like to take my friends / family here for some yummy mediterranean food!"""
10929,"Our times here are always amazing. Food is delivered very fast after ordering, all of the staff operate in a professional and friendly manner, making their rounds to each table, far more frequently than other restaurants in the fairbanks and north pole areas. Food is always as delicious as it sounds on the menu! Absolutely the best Chinese restaurant for hundreds of miles."
10930,Crowded and feels like it's falling apart. Some of the bartenders are nice
10931,No car here.
10932,"Terrific views, nice trail"
10933,"So many things to choose from, souvenirs is a big hit here!"
10934,"Sweet and Smokey

House made bbq sauce (gluten free)
the sauce to me was way too sweet, I prefer salty/savoury over sweet, but I appreciate that its in house made and my husband has the sweet tooth and really enjoyed the sauce.
Keeping true to the smoke house name, the meat punched me in the mouth with Smokey flavors, it was pretty awesome.
The pineapple coleslaw was honestly my favorite part even the pineapple was smoked, and for me to say the coleslaw was the best part is a big deal since I usually can only eat 3 bite of coleslaw and then gage by the 4th.
The cowboy fries (pork, cheese and bbq sauce), the fries were delicous and I'm a large fan of nacho style cheese sauce but the pork made the fries too soggy and it was way too sweet, I couldn't finish them but my husband did.
The service was helpful and quick.

My final word is that if you are one who prefers salty over sweet then this might not be the place for you, but if you enjoy a caramelly sweet bbq sauce that's not too thick and not too thin, then I recommend you drive by and try this place."
10935,Nice place. 5 stars.

10939,"Genuine: the owners have been quite accommodating for through this pandemic and are ensuring their customers are well cared for and have the best dining experience possible.

They provided outdoor seating with individual heaters for each table- minus the coat, I felt like I was dining indoors. I was quite toasty and felt I was experiencing an authentic, Alaskan experience while dining outside in the snow.

The service was remarkable and the food- I don't think I can say enough about their menu! They're so crafty! Not only do they have a list of craft beers a mile long, but they've gone above and beyond to provide a menu that anyone would enjoy. Their burgers are drool worthy and they give you the option to go vegan and GF.

If I lived closer to them, I'm pretty sure I'd be at their doorstep nightly.

10945,Geek squad protection fixed my problem.
10946,"I have had drinks and food in this place several times with friends. The food is decent, and normaly the service is good. However I noticed at off times the service goes to the toilet. My waitress sat aroind talking to a guy sitting at the bar and never even came to refill my drink in the hour and a half we were there."
10947,I love frontier outfitters.
10948,Not very helpfull employees.

10961,"I.... have found and purchased the strongest weed I have ever smoked at this shop right here. They constantly keep a supply of very strong strains available.  You ever needed to smoke after a flight? Lucky you! The house of green is located very close to the airport and are open til midnight!
Local Secret: Gas Monkey is my favorite and apparently all of anchorage as well because it sells out in a single day....."
10962,"Do not use this business.  Any other way to ship your goods is better.  Use a barge if you have to.  Your freight will arrive sooner with less trouble.  This is an honest review, not just an angry attack.  They are truly the scourge of the industry."
10963,They got it all.
10964,"Great experience!  Arty was super friendly and accommodating, getting us into the right sized unit on very short notice.  Very helpful and knowledgeable explaining insurance options as well.  Thanks!"
10965,Always a over the top experience. I say that because i go in planning to spend 10 dollars and end up spending 40... hahaha great place otherwise. Good marketing
10966,"Always good, always reliable, never have left this place dissatisfied, if you're in Anchorage and want a good burger, look no further"
10967,Yes
10968,Fun hill to sled located in Nunaka valley.
10969,Today check out was fast.  Usually dread going with my kiddos due to slow checkout.  But some items are even sold out at Wal-Mart too.
10970,An amazing coffee house with great coffee and enjoyable local art for sale.  The old church at the base of mount marathon makes this a wonderful place to have a cup of joe with a good book you have been wanting to read.
10971,This is such a cute little place to get coffee or grab a bite. The old building is charming and a nice atmosphere.
10972,"One of my favorite breakfast locations. Very busy on Sunday mornings but the wait isn't crazy. The service is quick, friendly, and the food is delicious. Never had a problem with the quality. Parking can be a little tough if it's busy."
10973,This place is part of Fred Meyers in name only.  I had customer service with attitude.
10974,Good place for Asian (Indian) needs.
10975,On weekends it‚Äôs my go to I‚Äôm a daily Starbucks drinker and when I‚Äôm in Anchorage four days out of the week this is the location that I have decided to stick with I love the staff here. Vern is the manager she‚Äôs wonderful
10976,Good excelent
10977,"Excellent shop!  Visiting from PA - stopped in
Quality and quantity is amazing. Staff friendly and most helpful.  Anyone who knits or crochets will find what they need."
10978,"Intelligent service backed with knowledge and easy information sharing made this experience preferable as a comparison shopper.
A sign in gives you a service roster, comfortable seating in the wait area ready to accommodate anyone with large windows, TV and open space.
The best price in town for my desired services also sweetened the visit for me, l will advocate for this business."
10979,Best sunsets!
10980,A great stop to read about and see some of the history of the area.
10981,Good prices
10982,Love this place. As a hairdressing apprentice I appreciate that I can get my supplies here.
10983,Its fast
10984,Can be pricey depending on the product.  People are great but only one checkout open most of the time.
10985,"Have stayed here several times, and the staff is more than helpful. Do wish that there was a refrigerator in the rooms because I like to keep food cold,  and then heat up in microwave-especially if I'm here more than one day. But I do like staying here because of the convenience of being in the downtown area."
10986,Not bad. Better selection on South side.  A few great people to help but a lot of lazy people.
10987,"I have no complaints about the food, but the atmosphere certainly leaves something to be desired.  You go in hungry and everything looks great, by the time you leave you have seen the worst of humanity and realize that you are part of the herd"
10988,One of the must visit coffee shops in Anchorage
10989,"We rented a kayak and all the related gear from these nice folks in Anchorage,  then took it out for a spin around nearby Jewel Lake Park. Highly recommend this place."
10990,"Service was awesome, food was off the charts. Steak and Shrimp where the favorites for the night!!"
10991,"My son and I came here for Saturday Brunch. There were some Pro's and a lot of Con's.

The Pro's we experienced was the view of the ocean and some of our food.

We ordered calamari, a kids breakfast and the praline french toast.

The Calamari was amazing. My toddler even ate it. I enjoyed the artichoke that was mixed in. After we ate our appetizer we waited thirty plus minutes for our actual food. Tables that were seated way after us, which we waited awhile to get our appetizer, were even served their food before our appetizer.

We waited so long for our breakfast the waitress brought my sons strawberries out seperate that should have been on his plate. That is how long we waited.

We waited so long I contemplated leaving.

Our food finally gets to the table and my son's food is cold. His bacon is so cooked it is beyond crispy, it was burnt. It wad dry, as in no moisture left in it. His eggs were sweating water because they were over cooked and rubbery. The potatoes look like they came from the freezer with dried shrivled bits of mushroom added and an onion here and there.

My french toast was fabulous. My bacon was crispy but not burnt crispy like my sons. Again what is with these potatoes you guys? You could do better.

When the waitress asked me if my child liked his food he told her no and I explained why and she didn't seem to care about my sons opinion. She just insisted he took another bite of eggs which he tried to do and spit it out. Because the rubbery dry texture was making him gag.

He ate none of his breakfast, he ate my bacon. I ate two pieces of my french toast none of my potatoes or my bacon because it got high jacked by my starving kid and we got our bill. We paid for all of the food and honestly I don't know if I want to come back.

She never offered to have it remade, even then would that had taken another thirty plus minutes? In total we were there for an hour and fourty five minutes and not much of that time was spent eating.

I recomend to everyone if you are wanting to wait for good breakfast food actually made from scratch and not over priced go across the street. That is worth the wait."
10992,"They left food out of my order but the manager corrected it on my next visit.
Thank you"
10993,"Great environment, people, and work."
10994,Expensive
10995,"Its a little spendy beside $6 Tuesday for my liking. I often find the seating annoying because of people kicking the back of my chair often. The cost of food and drink isn't worth it unless you're wanting nostalgia feeling, I'd recommend going out to eat first.

The screens are big and the sounding is good. The chairs aren't uncomfortable, it really depending on the seating and other individual's around you."
10996,"A wonderful experience: from the moment we walked in till the last bite of the delicious Blueberry Eggrolls dessert! The short rib entr√©e cooked to perfection, as well as the sea scallops ‚Äúmac & cheese‚Äù! We loved everything about the place: the location, the atmosphere, the staff and most importantly their dishes!"
10997,"I love their thin crust, veggie pizza... And they are right next to D&B, so you can fill up before going in... A little spendy, though... But with it on occasion üòâ"
10998,"Well, where to start? Desk staff friendly, willing to help in any way, flexible free hotel shuttles to train Depot, visitors center, all places nearby. Rooms clean, super quiet and comfortable rooms, decorated nicely. Downside: expensive restaurants, no air conditioning. However, it's been at or near 90¬∞ all days we've been here. Highly unusual! And it's near a stream, lots of tree cover and nice fans so it wasn't intolerable"
10999,Gotta get the puppy's nails trimmed.
11000,Excellent breakfast!
11001,Good fresh mexican with a great salsa bar.
11002,Very helpful staff and they have everything you need for vaping
11003,"Great local store for snacks, vape/cigarettes, and N95 masks."
11004,"This is a long time Anchorage restaurant... There's lots of memorabilia inside...

I remember going there as a young kid  I get a.  feeling of nostalgiawhen I went back there.   There is much memorabilia for the state of Alaska and definitely captures and older time period"
11005,"This is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere in the US. Whenever I'm in Anchorage, I stop here. I haven't had anything I didn't like, and their daily specials are delicious and usually unique."
11006,"Hands down and I am from NY you will never get better authentic caribean cuisine anywhere in Alaska.  Keep it up proud of my Latinos.  Show what we have to offer from our culture , flavor, quality , exquisite taste . Nothing like this here. Thank you for been here in Alaska. And to those who only have done 9 reviews dont listen to them . Some people just dont read the restaurant hours clearly posted in the front and on line so is the menu. So that 1 star not valid . Gracias por la comida es excellente."
11007,"At first I didn't really think I would leave there with a new car and already had that mentality as I walked in. I have to say I was totally totally shocked that I actually left in my first ever brand new never used car from Lithia Chevy South Anchorage,Alaska. Omg, Alex the sales rep was flippin awesome, friendly, easy to talk with and made things very easy to understand. Arnaldo, who was one of the financial report at Chevy south, was just as awesome as Alex, and explained everything in layman's terms to help fully understand my financial responsibility. I can't say enough great things about my experience at Chevy south, and Kudos to GMAC for financing me too. I will ant to totally thank everyone who was involved, and I just can't say enough about how great Alex and Arnaldo made my experience to actually drive home in a brand spankin new car. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

Sincerely from the bottom of my heart,

Michael Frye
Very proud owner of a 2017 Chevy Cruz"
11008,"I suppose my review reflects the current slow death spiral of malls across America.  The mall is older and despite efforts to update it's facade it still shows it's age.   The variety of stores is great, however, and the inebriate problem has diminished since they upped their security."
11009,New Life is welcoming and loving. We felt at home immediately.
11010,Great service!
11011,"I gave this place 5 stars because they have very knowledgeable and reliable staff.
Earlier last month we purchased LED bulbs to replace our florescent lights from here.

HUGE, shout out to STEVE. He gave me expert advise on how to convert our florescent fixtures to LED.
The quality of product exceeded our expectations.  We are happy to have light in our office again!!!
We are now believers in Brown's Electric in Wasilla, Ak. And will shop exclusively with them.
We highly recommend Brown's Electric in Wasilla, Ak.
And a big thank you to Steve!"
11012,Best burger I had lately
11013,"Way too pricey, they wanted $25 for the lane for 1hr plus $5 per person for shoes that's $35 for 2 people. We ended up going to Jewel Lake Bowl $10 per person for 2.5 hrs shoes included and very clean nice place."
11014,"Bright, clean shop! Friendly staff."
11015,Was able to keep Helen the Husky over night let me work out a price line deal.
11016,One of my new favorite places
11017,"I went in there to see if they carried replacement pads for my headphones, they helped me figure out what I needed but they did not have them in stock. They offered to special order them (for free!) and price match with a website who had them for slightly cheaper. They had some issues getting them because it was not in the catalog from the manufacturer but they got in direct contact with Shure to get them for me. Kept me informed the whole time and called right away the minute they showed up at the store.

I am extremely pleased and will be shopping there again next time I need anything music related. Great staff, great price, great service.

I could not ask for more from a local business."

11019,Good food and service.
11020,"A wonderful walking park with kayaking or paddle boarding, great for dog walking and young to old crowd that is comfort and safe"
11021,"My favorite toy store. Friendly helpful staff, by far the best collection of woods in Alaska."
11022,"Got the Heodoppbap (spelling might be off). Basically a giant poke bowl~

Sauces, miso, radish dishes served before the meal are somewhat vinegary and dominates the other flavors so you don‚Äôt really taste much other than vinegar. The bowl itself was MASSIVE. Like a pho bowl. Had to take some home and eat for lunch the next day.

If you get the ice cream, the Red Bean is the BEST. I‚Äôd say second best is the Green Tea one if you don‚Äôt like beans.

Overall a great family friendly atmosphere that can also accommodate date nights. Has a sushi bar you can also sit at. I‚Äôm curious to see what other hits I can experience while trying to avoid the misses."
11023,Just wonderful. Great for adults and kids.
11024,Great and helpful staff prices are a little high but you always get quality products
11025,Great ice cream and service.
11026,"Nice,clean ,good smelling inside place.We mentioned that we are limited on time,and asked , how long does it usually take for food to arrive,they said about 10 min, and our food was prepared in 10 min. Everything was tasteful and fresh. Stuff and servers are very polite and professional.I am definitely coming back."
11027,"Food was delicious, priced appropriately for what you get."
11028,The staff at this location is awesome.
11029,A hidden gem in Anchorage! Usually cheaper for nicer rooms than comparable hotels near the airport. Staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast definitely needs some improvement; fix that and it would be a 5 star rating for me.
11030,Really fun to design your own pizza üçï!!  Great crew!
11031,One of my favorite Anchorage cafes
11032,Amazing place 2 eat dont need 2 dress up 2 eat and amazing food
11033,"Beautiful view of Juneau, make sure you hike to the cross but skip the restaurant which is gross-go back down the mountain to the twisted fish or hangar üëç"
11034,So delicious. This place always hits the spot. Free soda if you ride your bike
11035,Nice store. Large variety of everything
11036,Good pizza.
11037,Its McDonald's. The $1.00 $2.00 $3.00 menu is additional $0.50 in Fairbanks. And lots of people with confusion of what they want
11038,"Nice experience visiting the museum.
Lots of information of Alaskan arts , history and the way of native people‚Äôs living.
Lots of real local animal specimens"
11039,"Nice stuff, high prices!"

11054,Awesome. Great food and friendly people.

11060,Great place
11061,"Clean restaurant,  good food.  Service with smile."
11062,Always so yummy with great service for years!!!!
11063,"Nice and organized location, staff is happy to assist you and will go over options they have available.  Only rating it a 3 because their pricing is not even remotely competitive, its Alaska and I'm aware the options up here are not as rich as say Los Angeles but at least be more competitive so I'm not reaching for my phone to buy from Amazon.  So an msi board gamer plus and an I5 8th generation and one stick of 8gig cheap china memory for almost 800 is a bit steep when amazon sells the motherboard for 119 and the same processor for 299 I'm not getting the sense they are interested in competing.   Its a small shop and I'd love to buy local but smart buyers will rather wait 10days for amazon shipping than 500 they could buy gas and groceries for. If the pricing was maybe 100 or even 150 off the difference I'd be home building my computer now."
11064,Fun and funny!
11065,I found most of what I wanted The managers and other workers are kind. They provide free fruit for the children that come shopping.
11066,"Came for dinner tonight, all was good, till someone at the table, got a plastic piece in there Curry.  We where told be the staff it was an onion skin.  The manger did not see the foreign object that was in my food.  But did trust what I said and took the dish off my bill.  Thank you for that.  He did not seem very sincere in his apology."
11067,"Yes. This is the place -- with, frankly, some of the very best wings we've eaten in Alaska (or anywhere else). Especially on a wintry day, a perfectly respectable hot pizza, a good sandwich and fries, and a shared plate of wings ought to warm you right up. We love the lodge-inspired look of the place. Tip: try to snag that seat near -- but not right in front of -- the fireplace!"
11068,"Best sushi in town! Service is fantastic, the whole staff treats you like a friend. Highly recommend! Make sure to try the King Kong roll."
11069,"I love the steak taco salad, but all their foods are choice!"
11070,"Rating of 5 stars because of the food I chose. The Baja Tacos were great. The prices are reasonable, great service, and a clean restaurant.  I also had the Ceviche made with Halibut. Delicious."
11071,Cool place to grab a couple beers in downtown Fairbanks. Great tap selection!
11072,Mexican.... Food..... Yum
11073,Decent subway.
11074,Decent selection of holsters. A bit over priced on handguns.
11075,Excellent authentic German food.  Definitely leaves you feeling full and sometimes with leftovers to take home. All food looks amazing and tastes phenomenal. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for German food or even to anyone just wanting s good meal.
11076,"Gonna have to give this one a mediocre score. While my dish was tasty, my date got a roll that tasted kind of off and ended up making her sick after we left. I really wanted to like this place too..."
11077,"Closed down, way over priced"
11078,Nice quick get away.
11079,Heather does an amazing job and the staff are friendly!
11080,Here is your chance to get up close to a glacier. Bring light gear to hike closer but not to extreme. Well worth the stop on your way to or from Valdez.
11081,Was trying to shipped something from Fairbanks to Oregon. For some reason it got to Seattle and they remarked the paper work saying the destination was Fairbanks. They tried to deliver it back to me. Called customer service to try to get it all straightened out. They were very rude saying it was my fault and i need to pay for the shipping down and back from Seattle. Yea.. Should have used Span Alaska or Lynden Transport.
11082,The animals are beautiful and the scenery
11083,The food is really good. They have weird hours and I have no idea how to deal with the half-service thing they do.
11084,decent price fast service
11085,Good food.
11086,"Super nice and friendly staff except the security guard who works at night. He us extremely rude, rides around all night spotlights your tent, walks around your campsite while you asleep. It was very weird. Day staff made it a nivmce trip though"
11087,"It's a smaller store, with a smaller selection."
11088,I've had issues everytime I go in. One time they checked us in and put us in a room only to call me 30 minutes later telling me my appointment would be cancelled since I didn't show up. You could hear my kids and dog playing in the room the whole time. I wouldn't recommend going if you value your time.
11089,It was not a very good experience. The food was okay but not equally portioned. The waitress was having a spastic fit so overall not a very good experience
11090,"Great hotel!  Service, food and accommodations are great!  Staff was awesome as well!!"
11091,Canby all you can eat
11092,"Good food, good service, what else is there?"
11093,"Had my hair cut by Danielle. Turned out well. The slicing/point cutting she did to achieve long layers turned out good. My husband doesn't usually notice when I've a haircut but he did this time in a positive way. He said it looked very nice. I would go back. $40 for a wash, cut, and dry is affordable for Anchorage. The waiting area is small but I only waited 5 minutes past my appointment."
11094,Awesome
11095,Amazing place. Awesome history.
11096,Man oh Man ... service were awesome.
11097,not that much hospital.
11098,"We went with our grandchildren to McDonald's for lunch and to play on their indoor playground. The food was as good as usual and the staff and service was very good. The staff were especially pleasant and helpful. The grandkids loved the playground area and didn't want to leave. It is great because it has all soft flooring so the kids don't get hurt if they fall, and the equipment seemed to be very clean and well maintained. If you wang some rainy day fun, go yo McDonalds and get a happy mezl and let the kids play inside!"
11099,Always busy not always enough staff working
11100,Tasty touristy place with tourist prices.
11101,Good food
11102,"Friendly service, good food, clean restaurant :)"
11103,Very big menu for such a small place. Cash only. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. My food was fine; the service was exceptional. I ordered a turkey sandwich. I guess I presumed it would be grilled or at least warm but it was just a normal cold white-bread sandwich like you'd make at home. Nothing wrong with it but nothing special. The jalapeno poppers were fresh and tasty. I asked for a fountain soda but they only serve cans. They went the extra mile and poured my can into a glass over ice to make it more fountain-like.
11104,I always like to eat in this restaurant I love their sourdough bread. Yummy!
11105,Customer service needs to improve
11106,"They are okay, but made my hair shorter than asked for because they were distracted by the phone."
11107,Great shop great hours had a issue with a product and these guys made me happy then some I'd recommend this shop over any in the valley also they price match huge benefit as well.
11108,"Home Depot will Only issue in store credit. If you do not have tbe oeiginal in store thermal printed receipt.

Lowes is WAY BETTER!"
11109,The service is always hit or miss with this place.  The food is usually always the same quality and it's pretty good.  Most of the bartenders make a good drink.  Get a window seat and you'll probably see something entertaining happening outside.
11110,Nice place to shop
11111,"Very enjoyable experience. Place is immaculate and artists are fantastic! George Bender is amazing, execellent cover up!"
11112,"One of the 3 musketeers helped me , he was awesome!!.. thank u Dartangan."
11113,Great food and nice friendly atmosphere
11114,"Great pool and hot tub the spring is 18 and older go when its cold, it will be much more enjoyable."
11115,Quick and friendly service. Happy to use this location anytime I need move something.
11116,Great pancakes
11117,"A very convenient location to get snacks and whatnot. A little expensive, but that's expected because of the location."
11118,"Lots of fun, the ride is great, the scenery is beautiful."
11119,"Chicks look better here than at mc.d's drive thru. Oh, the $1.25 sliders are worth it."
11120,Super nice and people
11121,"I chose the special 2 cheese burgers, fries and drink. Asked for 1 slice cheese per cheese burger. They don't do special orders."
11122,"Nice, new bowling alley. Not very big. Food was good."
11123,Welcome to my concert hall! I hope you love it as much as I do.
11124,Adorable little cafe. Clean eats!
11125,üî•üî•üî•üî• greatly priced and delicious food. More than enough to eat for dinner and lunch.
11126,"Although they have very nice gear, you can find it much cheaper in Fairbanks at many of the other outdoor stores. I am surprised they have stayed in business, seems dead every time I have visited. If you like throwing money into a fire this store is for you."
11127,Good parts and not that expensive
11128,An awesome hotel to stay in...nice lake view and there's sea plane base...so you could enjoy viewing the sea planes take off and landing...also if you stay in this hotel ...you can fly in Sea plane for a cheap 30 $
11129,"Very good food, friendly service, and great prices."
11130,"Subway is subway, prices are bit high but that's to be expected in Barrow. The food is always fresh, if you are hankering for subway give the Barrow subway a try."
11131,"Nice place to view sea life in Seward.  Unfortunately, on the day we visited all the tanks were murky due to the large amount of rain the night before making viewing difficult/impossible."
11132,"Some employees are rude and uninterested in providing customer service. It's really unfortunate. I go out of my way to avoid this location now, and go to the Abbott location."
11133,Best place in Anchorage for nails
11134,"I love this restaurant, always friendly staff and yummy eats."
11135,Enoch and Darrell was very helpful and patient with us. Like reeeally patient. We appreciate it and those guys definitely deserve a promotion/raise they‚Äôre doing carrs good
11136,"Trustworthy is now the only hardware store in town, and it is a well-stocked store with everything I needed to get a critical job completed in a time crunch. The floor salesworkers knew exactly where to find everything I needed. I was able to get in, shop efficiently, and get home to finish my project. I'll definitely be back!"
11137,I love some Arby's and this place was not disappointing good service
11138,Cool
11139,love the cash discount
11140,Friendly customer service and comfortable workout environment
11141,Park for everyone
11142,"Always get great service on the graveyard shift,  which is unusual for a fast food restaurant."
11143,Mason did an excellent job on my husband's back. We love going through Mason. Dont get me wrong the tattoo artist there are good too. But we've known Mason for years.
11144,Spacious theater with good acoustics.  Easy entry and exit even during Covid.  The entrance to the building is in the ‚Äòback‚Äô to left left side of the parking lot .  We wandered a bit before finding it.  The center is located near the high school.  We almost went to the Sheldon Jackson art center by mistake...

11154,Hard to find parts that they have in stock
11155,I was going on a daily basis they managed to screw up my beverage twice but instead of apologizing the blamed me for it !
11156,"Had to wait over an hour for an order that was supposed to only take 15 minutes. When they finally brought food out to curbside the server couldn't stop saying the F bomb. While my 4 year was in the car. Food was good.

Update: Went back a few weeks later. We called in the order and we were told food would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Because we were on our way back into town, driving down Seward highway, it took us about 25 minutes to get there. When I enter the establishment I was helped right away and was out of there in under 5 minutes. Like last time the food was good. They definitely do have the best buns in town."
11157,Parks alright usually not to busy
11158,"Great tasting sushi, friendly service!"

11163,Best liquor store in Anchorage
11164,"The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  Good product."
11165,"Takes forever, but great food to pick up"
11166,The food is always excellent and I keep coming back because of it but the service is always bad. Water never gets refilled and once you get your food they forget about you. Only bad thing is the service. Pad Thai is amazing.
11167,"Great food, reasonable prices, good portions, friendly service."
11168,"Everyone loves Kavas!!! Fast service, good food, and good people!!!"
11169,Parking is a nightmare.. don't bother just dropping by reservation only..which is crazy cause its a dump

11171,Old Alaska  at its best
11172,"Dr. Fortson is the best skin doctor my family visited. She‚Äôs straightforward with the options you have. She has great front desk staff, not much wait in the lobby, and seldom is there a long wait and they keep you posted if they are behind of schedule. Take the stairs instead of the elevator when able,ood excercise, make your heart & pulse work. Parking lot is not a problem in her clinic. Great location.  Before you have aesthetic procedure and buy those expensive packages, see her 1st!
If you have persistent acne, and you tried blue peel, phototherapies, expensive products & more painful procedures, don‚Äôt waste another hundreds of $$. See Dr. Jayne Fortson!

And her MA‚Äôs and frontline staff are very nice."
11173,We did the sleigh ride with them and had a FANTASTIC time!  The ride was beautiful and the kids enjoyed it.  I'm thinking of doing the romantic late night ride with the cabin with my wife.
11174,"Love Wendy's food, but sadly there is so much changeover at this location that service and wait time is highly inconsistent. It is however, always clean and well stocked."
11175,Packed restaurant still had awesome service!!!
11176,"I like it because it's indoors and it also has regular service hours, and the plus is that you can check mail anytime it's 24/7 access which is awesome convinent."
11177,Love the Alaska zoo! Such nice trails and educational info about the animals. Im a lifelong Alaskan and I still enjoy going!
11178,Very clean lovely house keepers and front desk clerks

11180,Best Chinese dining experience in the FNSB.
11181,Has one of the largest international produce selections in town and amazing produce sales ü§©ü§©ü§©
11182,"I had an excellent time when I visited this location with my friend, the burgers here are excellent as well as the alcoholic beverages and they will also bring you a bowl of pickles for free if you request. The staff here is very friendly and accommodating. I would recommend this place 10 out of 10 and I will be back!"

11189,"It's nice and clean. However, there are leeches so swimming is a no, no! There are a couple of people fishing here and there. Didn't witness any actual catching going on. We actually came upon a family who's kayak flooded in the water and we were able to rescue them to the dock. It was a great day at the lake."

11198,"went there to pick someone up, lots going on"
11199,"Have been here a few times. I really like their holiday decoration sales. Christmas items were 25% off and we are still 2 weeks away for Christmas. Most stores dont put items on sale until after the holiday has passed. We bought this gorgeous wooden angel with a carved nativity scene on its gown. Im not sure why it didnt cost more than what it did and it was even less with the 25% off.
We have also asked for help finding things and the employees are very friendly and helpful. They are also very knowledgeable in their respective work areas."
11200,Their bison burger was amazing
11201,Food was not up to par. Waiter tho was great
11202,Matt was amazing! He got me into a great car at a great price! Easy no hassle no pressure! This was the best car purchasing experience I've ever had!
11203,Always has the best deals on meats in the valley!
11204,"Never disappoints. Great beer, awesome pizza and perfect music."
11205,Good drinks and food and people
11206,Extremely high priced and stingy with the meat. Before you know it they will be charging you extra to walk in the door.
11207,Great place to watch new movies
11208,Lots of parking but a bit of a walk.
11209,"Update 5/19: DISAPPOINTED. I was with my aunt for the first review, she got her phone screen replaced, got a case and a protector. The 2 gals that helped were great. However, about 2 weeks later her whole screen stopped working while out of town and she had to get a new phone. She went back with the device to see what they would do, and there was 2 gentleman in the store who were very rude and unprofessional. She was not expecting a full refund, but the complete lack of customer service was disappointing. There was no offer of any kind, no protector at the $10 rate, no case discount, which in addition to the rude attitude was frustrating. Maybe if they would have at least been kind it would have been a better experience. Do not recommend.

Super fast and friendly service. Love the$10 replacement deal"
11210,The budtenders are amazing. Look forward to see my girls in the A.M
11211,"A superb experience, much exceeded expectations, did trip to Hoonah and saw eagles and 2 bears. Back to the legend and cultural show. Walked through the old salmon Cannery museum. Really good shops. Saw orcas of the icy Strait Point and had a good coffee at the cookhouse. Superb Day and so peaceful. Thank you."
11212,Big selection
11213,"Just ok,, interesting shops"
11214,Excellent food and service. Started the Fairbanks Thai food reputation

11218,Wonderful source of information and the displays are simply amazing
11219,Loved the sampler. Had it again when I came back s few weeks later. Gotta go here. Great dining room views
11220,"This train depot dates back to the original colonists' arrivals to the Matanuska Valley during the 1930s. It's a City of Palmer historic landmark. Rarely used anymore for its original purpose, it is now Palmer's community center.

I just attended a middle school graduation for a granddaughter here. Recent upgrades and renovations have taken away from it's historic ambiance, but were much-needed. While I sorta miss that the flooring doesn't creak and moan anymore and the old feel of the depot was sacrificed for sake of modernity and functionality, the graduation went well, in part thanks to the improvements.

The exterior of the depot remains original and is worth a look if you're in Palmer town."
11221,Great beer
11222,"I was very specific asking for a large stuffed crust pep with jalapenos and parmesan packets.

I got a thin crust with no parmesan packets for $30 rip off!

When I called to see how they were going to fix it the girl was rude and said sorry, there's nothing she can do. Then said they were out of the cheese for the stuffed crust! How is this my problem?"
11223,Great place. Fresh produce and meats.
11224,Love this place medium rare is truly medium rare

11228,Guido's is an Anchorage classic. I recommend the stromboli
11229,Always a great place to go in the winter! We go there saturday evenings after ice racing. Good burgers and hot fries and good help.
11230,Loved it great for a hot day and tons of flavors to choose from.
11231,"I got dumped here by the same girl, at least 3 different times. I never want to go here again."
11232,Very nice place nice customer service great workers with great attitudes
11233,"The food was good but the company was unbeatable. Two amazing women who I'm totally blessed to be around. And there was a dinosaur? And pirates and mermaids? I mean... If not for the cod, do it for the atmosphere."
11234,Great food and service!
11235,"Antonio's was a real experience. The atmosphere is excellent inside this small restaurant. Great atmosphere , wonderful service and very authentic Greek cuisine. Went here on a business lunch for the first time and was wowed buy the whole experience. I had a gyro it came with potatoes and a salad with excellent balsamic dressing and an amazing feta in perfect proportion to the meal hand-delivered by Antonio himself. In addition to the already great experience he brought out 3 amazing Greek desserts for me and my associates to try. I will definitely be returning to Antonino's Greek Bakery."
11236,"Super fun place with a huge outdoor hangout, including Sunday bbq's and live music. Personal favorite part: Vegas size (~32oz) Long Islands for $12!"

11244,Great pool tables! And drinks of course.
11245,"Great food and the owners and staff are so nice! I'm very impressed with how well this restaurant has handled the pandemic, they will be my go to for Chinese food in Anchorage for as long as they're open."
11246,It's a store you buy food
11247,"Not a true buffet,  they charge a lot for every trip you make. Was shocked to pay $30 for a lunch. Never went back and won't.  Panda express is a better choice."
11248,Produce is often moldy. Prices are nice.
11249,"There is nothing here. I like Super Bear, Asiana gifts, and Udder Culture. HOWEVER, I havnt tried the new Poke etc... yet"
11250,Don't leave your car here.
11251,Frames! Damn love them frames!
11252,"This is, hands down, my favourite gym that i have ever worked out at. I like that they have options for everyone, of all fitness levels and ages. i enjoy the vast space the fitness center has to offer and the amount of equipment and variety of workouts available.

i think the best thing about this place is that it is family oriented and everyone, from members to staff are friendly and welcoming!"
11253,Need new  Machines in the back and the front needs new tables and chairs it just sad here in the northway area
11254,Could be better üòâ
11255,Pro Desk is where at!
11256,Ok pizza. The crust was too hard.
11257,"They are good but not amazing, depending on who your cook is you may get a awesome meal otherwise it's lacking. I've had it where the bruger I ordered was soggy which is not great."
11258,"So pretty, hikes and wildlife."
11259,Interesting tour of the history of the totem poles
11260,"Mongolian beef delicious,  staff was courteous and helpful."

11263,"Cozy, welcoming, and delicious! We read, colored, and enjoyed a special mommy-daughter date with sprinkle topped cocoa and fudgy chocolate cake!"
11264,"The food here is pretty good, and the friendly service is extra special.  There are many cafes in Talkeetna, and we randomly took shelter from the rain and chose this one for lunch.  We enjoyed our meal and loved the ""pride of place"" everyone exuded.   Food seems to be all made from scratch in house."
11265,"Got a gift card as a present, a little slow on service but the staff were very friendly and nice"
11266,"Quad shot White Chocolate Mocha, with CBD Oil, was more than delish! Great quality, friendly Barista, and the wait time was not too long at all. Highly recommended!"
11267,Have only been there once so far since new owner... Don't really know yet
11268,Wonderful place! Their meats are beautiful! Now they have ready to heat dinner items. They look sooo good!üòã
11269,"Better than expected, it isn't a super Walmart by any means, but it's good for what it is. The store doesn't sell anybfresh produce but it has everything else you'll need."
11270,Amazing! All the ingredients are so fresh! These people really know what they are doing. Absolutely fantastic.
11271,Honest staff. Go the extra mile.
11272,"I would have rated the salon much higher if it wasn't filthy, didn't have catty girls at the front desk, horrible variety and presentation of products. One thing they have is an amazing stylist named Chelsey Smith! She is fun, energetic and artistic. She really listens to her clients which is so important!!! Hopefully she can move into a cleaner more upscale salon where she belongs!!!"
11273,Stopped for lunch at Taco Azteca has full service and more of a self service side food is good
11274,Good hiking trails around this area..some trails are accessible to most anyone..and the views are always awesome
11275,The wait was too long. And the food was mediocre. Perhaps they were under extenuating circumstances because of covid-19
11276,Sister brought her car to get charged over tires oil change
11277,Good food fast
11278,"A little spicy but good food. Excellent, friendly service. Casual"

11283,Everything you need for a party... ANY kind of party... The staff is knowledgeable about everything in the store and they are very nice. I want the Cthulhu figurine they have for $50
11284,"The store was very dirty and the staff are awful. Despite the Burger King app pointing you to this location they do NOT accept mobile coupons. The store manager is very rude and told me to go somewhere else if I wanted to use mobile coupons, since they will not be accepting them. Very disappointed in this location."
11285,"One of my favorite parks for everything and everyone!  Trails, baseball fields, open fields, a nice pavilion."
11286,Large selection. Prices are fairly reasonable compared to other local competitors. Took about 1 week for paid delivery.
11287,"Classic Dave and Busters experience. Definitely not the cheapest day out, but was worth the fun. Wish they had DDR"
11288,Towing By The Best.
11289,Great food. We enjoyed the food and people.
11290,Awesome Buffet!
11291,Always good food and service.
11292,"It's a Subaway! There's two of em on Kodiak island, Alaska. Both are about the same. The one downtown seems to have more mature people working, and therefore slightly better service, but it's ""fast food"" so what do you expect. I usually get a meatball sub toasted, because the bread is barely baked to begin with. Cold cut subs, I'd recommend not toasted."
11293,"A great resource for information about the Portage Glacier and surrounding area.

Make sure you know the hours ahead of time, because you may find them closed when you get here.  If the wind is strong then you can't beat the view of the Portage Lake from behind some windows.  Sadly you can't see Portage Glacier because it has receded out of view.

Plenty of parking for cars and large RVs."
11294,This place is a must every time I'm in town! I absolutely love the tuna salad salad and their soup is phenomenal.
11295,"Very good food. Nice atmosphere.  Service was very good, especially since the server/bartender was alone and the place was full."
11296,"Great sushi, lunch specials are great as well."
11297,"Wife always loves the cocktails, love the bottomless fries, always a good meal..."
11298,Great place for delicious affordable food.

11304,Awesome resort area.
11305,"I just had the very best patty melt ever!!
It was grilled to perfection! So cheesy and delicious! The only bad part was when it was all gone! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
11306,Service was fast and the server was very attentive.  Generous amount of food and delicious. Price was fair.
11307,Moderate waits. Reps usually helpful

11309,They have a very nice clean place. Food is very good with a large assortment.
11310,Very kind and knowledgeable. Fun owners!
11311,GCI it sucks the church me for Internet. I never use
11312,Great place to buy my drinks.
11313,Great place to bring your family!
11314,"Great for the beginning kayaker, stand up paddle boarder etc.  Would have been a five stars but I got swimmers itch on my last trip.  Not serious but very unpleasant.  My fault I know it's late in the season and I was in the weeds."
11315,Very friendly and knowledgeable people. Highly recommend. Very reasonable prices as well.
11316,"Consummate good vibe dive hole-in-the-wall.

Popcorn, whack jukebox, and fun people."
11317,Amazing food and the igloo was such a fun ambiance. I was able to eat there as a vegetarian with gluten free needs. Super fresh and delicious salads and the margaritas were top shelf ü•∞
11318,"Bells is an incredible nursery, jewelry store, candy store, coffee shop, home decoration store all in one.  Hard to find, but worth the trip."
11319,Prices are medium to high for a basic breakfast. The coffee was good but they charge you 2.99 and leave the carafe but charge you for each cup.
11320,"I've been to this theater about a hundred times. It's always been clean, warm and welcoming. The staff has always been happy, helpful and never have had a case of rudeness."
11321,Grab a machine and play
11322,Very clean! Awesome sounds and great pictureüòé
11323,Love that burger
11324,Good section.Easy to find what you want. Good service.
11325,Great food and service. Bartender (Laura) makes really great Mocktails!
11326,"Excellent food and service almost every time, we're late with my order last time, but they resolved the issue promptly!"
11327,"What's better than watching a movie in a theater?, eating pizza, and drinking beer that's what....."
11328,Super great campground
11329,I love that they have separate areas for big and small dogs. I also really like that there are toys there for the dogs. My dog loves going and it is always an enjoyable time for both of us!
11330,"Definitely best food in town! If you are a tourist (like us) and don't know where to go for dinner, try this out! You won't regret it!"
11331,"$$$ Prices Listed Below $$$

In my opinion the best muffins made in Anchorage are right here at Fire Island Rustic Bakeshop.

There are three locations, but I was told the √úber Blueberry Muffins are made here.

This location is smaller, so seating is limited.  The parking lot can also be a little tight, so consider parking on the street if busy.

11333,Fast service
11334,Great information on all types of cannabis products!
11335,Great and fast service. The car we got was perfect for this trip.
11336,The place was literally 52 degrees at 3 in the afternoon. Almost all the food was cool to cold. No toppings for soft serve ice cream. And the bathrooms were filthy. I was very disappointed.
11337,"The music was good, the food was great, and the beer flowed! Rather disappointed with the crowd that was completely maskless. I can understand sitting outside in a group of trusted friends without masks, but that was not the case. This was a large crowd that intermingled! I would like to thank the management for ensuring that their staff were using the scientifically backed precautions!!"

11346,Good food! Good portions! Great service!
11347,Amazing ice cream
11348,"If you ain't drinking alcohol they seem to treat you like a second rate, less important customer. The food was good but four adults eating together and they brought two orders then twenty minutes later the third and five or so minutes after that the fourth persons meal came. Needless to say, the first two person's meal was cold by the time the last plate arrived (are we supposed to NOT EAT TOGETHER???). VERY DISAPPOINTING. I do not recommend this place."
11349,Good food and service
11350,The food wasn't that good
11351,"UPDATE BELOW! I went there for a much needed antibiotic on a Saturday, had to leave work and miss an hour, only to get off work and discover they did not send the much needed antibiotic to the pharmacy. Literally the only reason I went there and they couldn't do their job. Incompetent. Also the doctor ignored me most of the visit, and used a lot of terms I wouldn't understand, I had to ask him to explain everything he said. I needed urgent care, and they were not quick, and did not give me care.

UPDATE
I was contacted by someone that same Saturday night, and they got me the antibiotics I needed. They went above and beyond to fix their mistake."
11352,Service was a little slow and the food took longer than expected.  It wasn't crowded.  Caribbean jerk wings were Hella bomb and the onion rings.
11353,Crispy chicken ready fast and hot. No complaints
11354,It's a bar u feel at home in
11355,Good family lake park as it awesome new b structures to climb and play on.
11356,Fresh fish every day
11357,Always a joy. Great food and staff.
11358,Great shopping
11359,"Slow service,but good drink."
11360,Pizza was good. Prepared fast and easy to bake. For the price though I don't think it was worth it. I'll probably go to Papa Joe's on the old Seward next time and grab a hot pie.
11361,Nice new playground equipment.
11362,"Average food, over priced"
11363,Was a tad expensive. Guess all pizza places are. But I'm was actually surprised by the quality. Would choose it again
11364,Culturally great people
11365,"Price is OK, service is OK but the food is a bit underwhelming. We've been at least 3 or 4 times now and had similar experiences. Same sauce used in multiple dishes (gnocchi and pork medallions) my wife's vegetables were way undercooked and the pasta my daughter got was overcooked (falling apart). Overall, not terrible for the price, but there are so many great food choices in town, hard to pick this one again."
11366,"Its Walmart... That being said, this place is actually nice to shop at for Anchorage. Everyone says the Dimond location is better but I disagree. This place is more organized and the staff are friendlier. It doesn't seem like you have to look forever to find anyone for locked up items which is nice. The only downside is the vagrants that hang out by the grocery side entrance at the little garden square. They usually don't bother you but every once in a while you'll have one ask for money or for a cigarette."
11367,Very clean facility
11368,"They told me my windshield would be replaced in an hour, and it was! 55 minutes actually. These guys did a great job and I would definitely come here again to get, just hopefully not within the near future haha"
11369,Great Thai food and smoothies!
11370,"Best view. On certain days will leave in awe. If you're moving here make sure to stop and take it in. Worlds best views in Homer, Alaska."
11371,"Busy, pricey, upscale for my taste."
11372,Gorgeous yarn
11373,"food is great, always fresh and hot and tasty, I am a chef and John is one of the best chefs and service is on time  ."
11374,"Very friendly service. The waitress helped us very well, and the food was very good."
11375,Frames! Damn love them frames!
11376,It's one of the oldest tattoo shop in Anchorage... and love the boys and the work they do!!
11377,"Can get crowded from the local people as it‚Äôs one of the best Thai food I‚Äôve found in Alaska. We had the parang or purple curry (very good), the yellow curry just OK,  very good pad Thai and fried riceüëçgood bar selections. I was hoping their ‚Äúegg rolls‚Äù were going to be spring rolls, but they were bad Chinese egg rolls!!! Enjoyed their outdoor seating. Nice staff, but are busy, just have patience."
11378,Beautiful beach!
11379,Good hike. Great scenery.
11380,Great food and great service
11381,"Packed, but servers were on it. If you want a table during ski season, be ready to wait. Pro tip: You can get your own water from their water stations if you pound through water like I do so you can ease the work load of the servers"
11382,"Great for a couple, decent for a family.
The main feature of this hotel is the bathrooms' large bathtubs adjacent to an opaque double window that swings open to the room.
Not so private, but very convenient if you want  to watch TV while soaking.
Two adults can share this tub.
Probably."
11383,Really enjoyed the food it was great good all you can eat
11384,I have had sandwiches from here they are very tasty.
11385,Best ice cream in Anchorage on the south end.
11386,Nice people and fair inventory a Little bit high on prices.....
11387,Great hike today üíöüí™üèΩüòéüëçüèΩ
11388,Best coffee by far. Local
11389,"Terrible place! They need to shut this place down. I should have read the reviews before ordering here, but, it being Pizza Hut, I never thought it could be so bad here.  I placed an online pre-order at 1020, with an estimated delivery time of 1130. Never received any notification updates, no call, nothing. I tried calling and it just kept ringing and ringing. Finally I went ahead and called the Pizza Hut Customer line and will continue to do so until I get an explanation as to why they're still open with this type of customer service."
11390,These guys know more about electronics than anybody!
11391,Yummmmm.  And a super nice guy.  Stop and try his dumplings
11392,Food was extremely slow. Waiter was far too distracted trying to get female attention.
11393,"Followed a friend‚Äôs suggestion to try this place for their pizza and I‚Äôm glad I did. I had the Margherita pizza, which originally comes with meat but I wanted an OG Margherita and it was the best pizza I‚Äôve had since moving to Alaska. They have a wide selection of beer, my favorites being the stouts and ciders. Came back a second night and had a side of fries, which were also very good. Great service and ambience."
11394,Small sites. Convenient
11395,Good burger slow service
11396,Amazing Turkey Swiss Toasted Focaccia
11397,This is as close as you can get to a Safeway in the city.
11398,Always make my special drinks
11399,Yummy
11400,"Fun place, wish the bathrooms were more accommodating to little kids."
11401,Typical red Robin
11402,Great pizza great service!
11403,Nice rooms that are cheap.
11404,"We went in the winter. The kids enjoyed it and it was a good chance for them to see animals from Alaska. It was a bit smaller than I thought it was but it was clean and well kept. All together it was an enjoyable experience, once."
11405,"Very convenient with grocery store, hardware store, sporting good store, beer and liquor store, and gas pumps. Clean and new with friendly workers, hope it stays that way."
11406,Everything is fire. Go see Justin he‚Äôs a very knowledgeable and friendly bud tender.
11407,This place is dangerous to my wallet. So delicious!! Have to get there when they open to get the goodies! They sell out quick.
11408,"Great products, knowledgeable Staff. Awesome deals on products with a loyalty program to help with cost."
11409,"Pizza was pretty good. However, despite their claims, it's not ""the best in all 50 states"".
Prices are pretty reasonable for this area."
11410,"Pleasantly Surprised!  I had two separate orders I was going to check out at self-checkout. I was going through one register and asked Martina, the cashier on station, to apply the military discount. By the time I finished paying and bagging my order and was about to do the next one, I looked over and she had already rung them up on a seperate register and applied the military discount! That is excellent service! I was so pleasantly surprised! Thank you!"
11411,Nice lake to watch them fishing & large walk area
11412,"This train depot dates back to the original colonists' arrivals to the Matanuska Valley during the 1930s. It's a City of Palmer historic landmark. Rarely used anymore for its original purpose, it is now Palmer's community center.

I just attended a middle school graduation for a granddaughter here. Recent upgrades and renovations have taken away from it's historic ambiance, but were much-needed. While I sorta miss that the flooring doesn't creak and moan anymore and the old feel of the depot was sacrificed for sake of modernity and functionality, the graduation went well, in part thanks to the improvements.

The exterior of the depot remains original and is worth a look if you're in Palmer town."
11413,Food is not that good. Service is great...super nice people!
11414,"(Translated by Google) Excellent hotel. The writing price and quality is just super. Friends, I recommend using the services of this wonderful place.

11418,Good but expensive.
11419,"""The website ad for 2 pairs for $59.95 said that the glasses could be finished in 15 minutes, but when I arrived, I was informed that the frames that qualified for the deal had to be mailed in, which would take two weeks. This information wasn''t shared until after I had already gone through and paid for the exam, otherwise I would not have gone with your company.

I was then told that if I went with other frames, they could be completed in-store, obviously a slimy tactic to get customers to purchase more expensive frames. I then chose other frames only to be informed at the last second that my prescription was too high for them to be completed that day. This was after I called ahead of making an appointment to ensure that my high prescription would not cause any additional expenditure, delay, or other issue.

Customers should be informed ahead of time that the \""15 minutes\"" does not apply to everyone and that if you have a high prescription, it may cause significant delay.""

I sent that correspondence on July 1, a couple days after my experience in the store.

I called July 12 and was told that my glasses would arrive in Anchorage the next day. They told me they would be shipped to me in Fairbanks and should arrive at my address in two days. It is now July 21 and I have still not received my glasses. This is after my horrified experience in the store, where I felt mislead and taken advantage of even after my attempts to proactively ensure I would receive service as advertised. It has now been almost a month and I have not received my glasses. This is absolutely unacceptable and bordering on illegal. I have paid cash money with the expectation that I receive a product in return the same day. Stanton Optical has failed to do so and you has failed to provide reasonable recourse for that failure. I honestly believe I should be issued a full refund at this point in addition to the $50 credit they have applied to my account.

I have never been so angry, sad, and disappointed at a company. I have a high prescription, just started a new job, and really need my glasses for work. I rely on them too much and the incompetence of Stanton Optical has caused me a great deal of not only emotional strain, but additional strain on my eyes. I originally went in because my glasses broke and I chose Stanton because they were supposed to offer the fastest replacement. I now highly regret ever choosing Stanton. I would advise that you try any other option before you even consider choosing them yourself for fear that you might experience similar horror and literal physical pain from eye strain.

FALSE ADVERTISING"
11420,Ok.
11421,"The first ""real"" coffee I tasted in Alaska except for excellent coffee, the place is cozy and inviting and the service excellent"
11422,always good food and good service
11423,Great place to have a nice cold sweet ice cream. They are so creamy and delicious. They are only open on summer and it's a must visit place. The line can be long sometimes but its worth it. The staff members are  nice and accommodating. They let you taste test some stuff first if you're nice about it. The ice creams are great and- just go there and taste it.
11424,Nice but didn't have the parts I was looking for

11430,"Center Bowl is a blast from the past, with Neon bowling, colored pin bowling, league night, open bowling, bumper lanes, a snacks & cafe bar, mini arcade... It's got everything, even it's own pro shop for the serious bowlers. There's flyers that say private lessons are even available... Probably worth it for the person looking to improve their game, this is one of three serious bowling alleys in the city. The place is clean and friendly, shoes are clean, and you're given a brand new pair of socks that you keep upon leaving. Bowling balls are available in all sizes and weights, and the booth & computer are comfortable and easy to set up your game. I've no issues with center bowl in all the times I've been there.... It's always comfortable and always welcoming... I may not be the best bowler, but I never let that keep me from having a good time. Pro tip - check the back of your Carr's Safeway receipts for a buy 2 games get 2 games free coupon for here! You're welcome üòâ"
11431,Absolutely awesome store. I wish we had one in PA.
11432,That new phone feeling ri g ht
11433,I have been going to Golden donuts for 25 years at least and They are always awesomsauce at Golden Donuts. Today they proved how awesome they really are. I am stupid and had an issue and they did not stress out about it at all. These folks are always really nice and respectful. So I do still appreciate the local business. Thank you I would recommend Golden donuts anytime over the Big corporate guys. I did try the new place but the food taste like it was shipped up frozen and then just reheated instead of freshly cooked daily.
11434,Great prices
11435,Poor selection of products. Almost looked like they were going out if business.
11436,Great service!!
11437,D&b what to say lol. This place is fun for all ages. The staff is always very friendly and kind. If you have any issues they always seem to be able to help one way or another. It's a bit pricey however if you take advantage of the app and various discounts it's pretty easy to save alot of scratch. The food is above average bar food. Drinks are always yummy. Anti 2a due to the mall setting.
11438,"Delicious, fresh fish and crab. Best crab I've ever had."
11439,Great salad kids love it all
11440,Went for dinner. Best dinner out in Ketchikan so far!
11441,Ok
11442,Husbands favorite place. They closed the one closest to where I live total bummer... but always makes the drive worth it... this time we came there were bears in the dumpster out back they chased off and told everyone to be cautious. In mountain view even.
11443,"Great place for a adjustment, great staff health conscious."
11444,It's Arby's. No better or worse than most locations.  I will say the service at this location is consistently friendly. My kids are big fans.
11445,Great service delicious food. Always nice to go out with the girls and enjoy a weekend night.
11446,Cheapest place to find gear. If not they price match
11447,Good selection and service. Covid social distancing decent here. Covid safe. Enjoy =)
11448,Great toystore for unique toys and gifts.
11449,"I love this place.

I asked a girl on a date 10 years ago and of course I brought her here because it was affordable with good food. 7 years after that I asked her to merry me in king's parking lot right behind the sign. We've spent all our anniversaries dinners here, but this time with our new born.

This restuarant and its food deserve my 5 stars and more. Thanks for the great service for all these years."
11450,Easy to find and beautiful site. Clean toilets also. Little close to the highway for my liking though.
11451,Recommend this place
11452,Quick service
11453,"They deserve 0 stars, but since I can't do that, here's 1.

They rarely deliver packages, and wouldn't even put a redeliver slip in the mailbox until I complained to the Post Master. So no they still don't deliver my packages but at least I get a redeliver slip now."
11454,"The service was great, and the pizza was fair priced and delicious. For a quick pizza stop, it is worth every penny. Prices are similar to buying frozen  but you do not need to cook it yourself.   I would not call this establishment a premium pizza place, but noone would complain if you ordered from here for a party.  A big selling point for me is the pizzas are not greasy, unlike dominoes or pizza hut.  All in all  a great place for quick party pizza."
11455,This place is phenomenal!!! I can understand why the burgers are rated best burger in Fairbanks. I had the bacon burger and it was amazing. For dessert I had the salted caramel brownie. It comes alamode with a pretzel crust.. our server kept our drinks filled and checked on us regularly... I will definitely be back...
11456,The best soup and sandwiches in Wasilla. Their own fresh baked bread has an aroma to die for. Very relaxing environment.
11457,Great
11458,"There was a disabled person in front of me in line and i cannot stress enough how caring and patient the cashier was. I love seeing customer service as gunuine as this.
Excellent selection, quality merchandise, service with a smile. Will definitely be back!"
11459,"Amazing burgers and the Best fried rice in the Valley. Honestly, I Love BJ's! They are the best!"
11460,I've seen some great improvement in my physical fitness since I started at Orangetheory.
11461,Great food!
11462,Great atmosphere and good food.  Just make sure you have a reservation!
11463,Great breakfast cafe. Very popular. After eating the red we could see why it has such a good reputation
11464,"Some friendly banter, a good meal, and interesting decor."

11466,"(Translated by Google) In no case one should miss a boat trip in this national park. On our 4 hour tour we saw humpback whales, orcas, seals, bald eagles, sea otters and many more.

11475,"Had a ""panic in the streets"" attack when my male boxer, Giddeon came inside the house draining blood.  They said come right in.  Thankfully it was not anywhere near as bad as I feared it could be.  They cleaned and bandaged his foot and his is soaking up all the attention his owie is getting him.  The employees are calm, cool and collected...which helps when you are not.  It is nice they remember names of both the critter and I as at times like that I may not!!!  They also solved my problem of where to take my exotics after examing the other ""exotic"" VETs in town and still not finding one I would trust MY critters with I find that Alska Veterinary clinic has a Doctor that does exotics and they introduced us.  She seems quite knowledgeable and competent.  Eager to help and east to talk to and understand.  Turned out to be a great day."
11476,"This place is a hit or miss. But mainly a miss. We've been there a handful of times and the only reason I go there is for their buffalo burger. This last time is what drove me to write a review. We ordered the chili con queso and it came out cold and stale. When we asked for new chips, we ended up getting charged for them. My husband ordered the steak pasta and specifically asked for it without mushrooms and after waiting almost an hour for our food (less than five tables had people) it was brought out with mushrooms. So we waited another 10 minutes for his food to be brought out again. This place is horrible."
11477,"I always get seen quickly, the staff is very friendly and are concerned with my well being. I refer all my friends to Whole Family Chiropractic!"
11478,Excellent growler selection.
11479,Nice atmosphere
11480,Never again will I ever brung my car here. One they left parts in the front seat 2 they charged insurance for something they didnt even do
11481,Darn good food
11482,Best feature is the woodstove
11483,"Good overall. The bar was very cozy with a rustic d√©cor.  I'm pretty sure the waiter had to run to the package store across the street to get the beer I ordered - took 15 minutes to get it.  Excellent waiter. Clean room, view of cemetery next door.  Not much within walking distance.  No shuttle service from airport.  Breakfast buffet was $21, too expensive.  Check-in often had a line.  $15 to park, also too expensive give the lack of demand for spaces."
11484,Quick
11485,"Sometimes a decent place to fish, with permission, but it's not very accessible due to being in the middle of the oil lease in BP Field.  However if you go way up stream you could avoid this. But it's still native land. Best of luck!"
11486,The place to get rid of your garbage and there is also a free wood lot here also.
11487,"Old, need repair and renovations, tired... AK expensive without cause."
11488,great food. the place is a quaint joint that is clean and quiet most of the time. I highly recommend it. They do have live music one night a week so check it out.
11489,They absolutely suck at customer service.
11490,Great food along with great service not much of a wait.
11491,Friendly courteous knowledgeable
11492,Good time
11493,"Honestly, its the only store on the peninsula thats left for stuff at competitive pricing when you shop amazon. They'll have some pretty good deals, and most of what you need. Service has always been good, even though they are one of the few places that are open."
11494,Food for hungry
11495,Service was slow and little dirty
11496,"The staff seemed very friendly, and they did an amazing job on detailing my car. I'll definitely be going back to them when my car needs it. They were not too expensive either"

11518,Absolutely love this store got all the older games and system and if they don't have it they will order it for you without charging an arm and leg to do so
11519,"I had chicken red curry and it was soooooo good! My husband had seafood green curry and it had a generous amount of seafood! I was in heaven! Coming from Portland, we missed good Asian food but we are happy we tried this place! Definitely coming back!"

11521,"Rocky's Cafe is connected to a store. Nice shirts for sale near the counter. We ordered two quarter pounder cheese burgers w fries. It was delicious! We were greeted by a nice waitress. While it was busy inside, she had a great attitude which made it comforting. I also requested to have our caramel cheesecake and chocolate cake desserts to go. I would like to try their ice cream during the summer. Yum!"

11528,Great food.  Good service. Reasonable prices.  I just wish they‚Äôd get a larger location to fit more people or make the waiting room a little more inviting.
11529,"I enjoy the atmosphere, beer selection pretty good. Staff is about on par with the rest of Alaska, a little slower but friendly most of the time. The food I've had is pretty good, steak, burgers and halibut."
11530,I think they raise their prices In the summer for tourists.  I have never seen such high prices.
11531,Very good pizza
11532,Great for drinks on the patio in the summer
11533,Best fast food in Anchorage
11534,My home

11543,Overpriced but fun.
11544,I‚Äôve gotten a few tattoos here and always leave so happy. You wont leave without a good laugh and a satisfied experience. Wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else!
11545,"I absolutely LOVE all of their different cultural food options! And the facts that you can request something, but they are rather short staffed unfortunately."
11546,"Great deals. Good place. But since they are going ""energy efficient"" their interior temperature is 73 (I saw a thermostat, not just estimate) in the summer when it's about 75 degrees outside..... people with heart problems beware"
11547,"They have great pricing, friendly staff and a clean environment...what more can you ask for?!"
11548,A great dog park. Lake is amazing for swimming dogs. Lots of off-shoot trails and a variety of scenery. This is a goodplace to see moose. Avoid if the planes are taking off over Anchorage.
11549,Best price for gas!
11550,They always remember my drink so I don't have to say the same order every day.
11551,Really good Thai food in a small unassuming location. Friendly service. Gets busy at lunch!
11552,"Our room was new and our accommodations were pleasant. The best part of our stay was the free continental breakfast. It was so much more than a continental breakfast. They had a plethora of hot food as well as your traditional favorites. A word of caution though, they only offer the free breakfasts during the off season in the fall and winter months. They have a nice breakfast for a fee in the summer."
11553,The pizza is awesome and their beer is amazing. My husband brings home a growler everytime we go. The staff are very friendly. Can be a long wait but worth it.
11554,Best in Palmer

11562,"Yes, there are ALWAYS long lines for this place, because it is totally worth the wait. The wild mushroom pizza (I ask for it with red sauce) is incredible. The microbrews are delicious! The salads are fresh, innovative and very good. there's no way to go wrong with this place."
11563,Friendly staff and great service.
11564,Limited beer list compared to the flagship. Great bloody and standard menu with an ak twist. Nothing too special tho

11576,"I just started going to Anchorage Midtown Dental Center and I am very glad that I am. Dr. Tudor, his hygienist, and the rest of staff are friendly, helpful, and understanding. They have been taking very good care of me and I am very appreciative. The staff has been on top of everything in helping me to be a part of my dental treatment plan. I also appreciate the email and text reminders for my appointments. I would definitely recommend this place for those looking for dental service."
11577,Great product. Wonderful service.
11578,"Beautiful, the trees have grown up a bit but still a nice first glimpse."

11583,Great Park lots of things to do
11584,Loved the food and prices are right.
11585,Fast food
11586,Huge burgers and awesome cheesecake and cream pies
11587,Good selection generally friendly staff
11588,"Discovered this place when in Alaska 2 yrs.ago. When we returned this year we stopped again.  Improvements on the decor,  food was great and so was the service."
11589,"Real steep trail, great views at the top."
11590,Holly is fantastic and the bouncers keep things friendly and safe!
11591,Good as all other Costco
11592,This is one of the 4 beaches we have in Ketchikan and one ofnths few that has play grounds at it this is meant for kids to go to and be able to swim and play at a play ground. This one is one of the most popular beaches
11593,Very good food and reasonably priced!
11594,"Excellent selection of beer, wine, liquor and all of the accoutrements that go along with that. They recently started a mix and match six pack program where you can try new drinks without having by buy 6 of one kind. Unfortunately, they no longer sell gourmet meats and cheeses. Only packaged snacks like chips."
11595,Hreat
11596,Great spot for photos
11597,My son absolutely loved it!
11598,Value village rocks they have great deals on clothes and sometimes have textbooks and flash cards for nursing students
11599,All in my group agreed that the food was okay but not great. The service was horrible. We had to ask another server to find our servee so we could order. It took 15 minutes for our first drink order and twenty for the next. The third drink never arrived. We had to ask the manager for our bill and boxes. The food was not worth the wait.
11600,"Lovely servers, food tasted great. Willing to make accommodations if you change your mind"
11601,Best priced meat in the valley and always fresh. Beats big chain prices by far
11602,Very nice.
11603,"Well done quick Indian lunch. Nothing fancy, but the lamb has great flavor, the service is quick, and this might be the best bargain in Fairbanks."
11604,A FUN place to bring young kids...the tour guide was a joke and a ripe off....but I would recommend taking out of town family to visit....they have an AWESOME  aquarium....and touch tanks....and if you come during the fish run it is FUN to watch....
11605,Great variety!
11606,This was my first time in 2 years living here and I didn't know how much history I had missed . It's also a great walk with beautiful scenery of Juneau bay .
11607,üòòüòÉ
11608,"Great atmosphere, love how they treat you there."
11609,"Went to see have a look at cars with that flyer they send out. I was blocked at the door by a sales representative who was not friendly at all. I left with out looking at anything, and will not return there ever."
11610,"First time there was positive. Just ordered spring rolls and the fried Beef Jerky.  There were 4 Spring Rolls  that were a good size and very tasty. The fried Beef Jerky  was excellent too... if you like a tasty crunch. It'd be great on a hike. The seasoning included lemon Grass. I will visit them again to try other delicacies.

4 Star rating for now. Will let you know more on my next visit."
11611,Needs to  go  west  in Alaska  they  don't  cover  the west coast
11612,Nice gym. Has new weights and a rock wall!!
11613,"Lack of helpful service finding items and employees sent you on run around to wrong places instead of offering to help.
Perfect example when I got to register, I was asked if I found everything okay.  When I said no and told her what i was seeking, cashier gave me blank stare and reply of, i know we have that somewhere!"
11614,Apparently even if ordering from a business they will not take any cash over $50 even if you offer exact change i know for a fact they make exceptions to their no checks rule for other businesses but apparently the Saturday manager does not want to make this company any money
11615,Moogs loves getting his gains at masters of iron ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°  Masters of iron is a  competition gym  Located in Old Town Palmer  Featuring competition gym equipment as well as cardio and strength and much more   Masters of iron welcomes everyone and it's family friendly It has every athlete's or average person's basic needs  Whether you're thinking about Shaping up or competition I highly suggest this place‚ô°‚ô°
11616,Gas prices too HIGH!
11617,New games and fun activities for the whole family. Good birthday party in the back.
11618,Good place to go

11636,Susan is the best these guys know there vape and are extremely helpful to new comers to vaping! best ejuice sampler bar ever!

11639,"Always very friendly staff, enjoy shopping here and love their sales! Great selection of outdoors gear"
11640,Enjoyed a beer on the terrace and the view was fabulous. Friendly staff.
11641,Best coffee house with excellent food! Only place we found cold brew during our time in Alaska üòç Stopped here on our way out of Denali area for breakfast and a takeaway lunch. Baristas we're super busy but took the time to make me a special drink id been craving and blended it which took it to a whole new level. I tried their fried brussel sprouts for lunch and would highly recommend!
11642,The best Sushi in Anchorage as far as I'm concerned.
11643,My favorite beach. Don't go here please :)
11644,Clean and fast to get in to the movie
11645,"Great food, arrived exactly as ordered. Service was fast and friendly."
11646,These guys consistently have the best customer service and the best parts selection in town.
11647,! Fantastic customer service and the food. They had plenty of vegans and meat-eater choices. The ladies who were helping us with our orders today have been so kind and supportive. Although we are here in Alaska we certainly want to come here. Thank you!
11648,"Gas station with the best price in town for gas fill-up.  Unattended, 24 hours, swipe your credit/debit card to fuel up here.  Devil's Hideaway/Gonzo AK/Chan's Thai Kitchen nearby for a meal as well as topping up your vehicle."
11649,The food was good but my burger was and fries were cold on this visit
11650,"Great place to chill and relax through out the day.. they got wifi, computers, pool tables, a movie area, a lounge area, phones, a kid area, a mini work out area snacks and a couple other stuff."
11651,Other than always crowed and finding parking is always a challenge.
11652,Another local bar. Pool tables.  Nice bar.
11653,"Beautiful view, great happy hour"
11654,"Great food, excellent view!"
11655,"Always good food, and large portions!"
11656,"One of my favorite local bars. I love that it's a little bit dive-y, but then it surprises you with (always fresh) flowers in the restroom and the best Manhattan that has ever touched your lips. Pretty much the best bar tenders around (also super tasty and convenient food across the street)."
11657,"Friendly staff -very helpful.
The cars are clean and well maintained.
And if I ever had a question they promptly found the answer.
I love Enterprise rent a car . They are the Best!"
11658,Work their have bedbugs. Good place to work. Hot water system sucks. Was force to lie to guests about rooms. Pay is üëç
11659,Excellent food and service. Great view as well. Food can be pricey but you're paying for the view. Fish is always a good option here as it is fresh. I suggest trying either the halibut BLT or halibut fish and chips.
11660,"Poor service, bad food and high prices for what your getting"
11661,Great ski!
11662,"Though the quarters were little close for my liking, the location was good, free breakfast was great, amenities were good."
11663,Best burgers in town.  I don't really have more to say.  Best burgers in Anchorage.  (they are always nice to me too)
11664,"Great variety of sushi rolls and really good food choices like teriyaki, boulgi and noodles. Friendly service and you can find American options as well."
11665,Very pretty spot!
11666,great price got a nice serving of fries. the fries were crispy. there were some flies on the wall though. the fries are authentic that just right crispy  the shrimp is fresh flavorful. the supreme burger is pretty flavorful got the veggies
11667,"Mark in sales was wonderful. He helped me find cars in my price range, without any pressure to go higher than I felt comfortable paying. He stayed with me for several hours, braved barely above 0 temperatures twice to find the cars I wanted to look at, and did it all with a helpful, non complaining attitude. Michelle was also very helpful figuring out the financing. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the market for a car!"
11668,Good food and movie with friends.
11669,"Room is spacious and comfortable. Staff is friendly. Breakfast isn't free, but the Grand Buffet has a good selection."
11670,nice place. mountain bike trail
11671,I love how they went out for Halloween and did something for the kids. My daughter and I had a blast.
11672,Food wasn't anything special.  Staff were great though.  Great service
11673,"Excellent evening.  Fast friendly service.Good beer,wine, scotch and whiskey menu. Amazing seafood chowder. Seafood pasta, blackened halibut and grilled halibut were top 5. Right on the river with plenty of room.  Great atmosphere and a lot of original antiques from the gold rush days. Plenty of parking.  Nice experience."
11674,"I'll admit right now I'm biased. This is my neighborhood haunt and I frequent Kaladi regularly. For those familiar with Kaladi coffee you might say oh, it's just another Kaladi, but it isn't. The staff at the counter take care of you like none other. Try the natural vanilla or coconut in your latte. I wouldn't even have known about them if the gals at the counter hadn't recommended them to me. They give a deeper flavor and richness to your coffee. The staff's generosity of spirit is one of the reasons why I choose to go here, also for their large second level which has a semi-private conference room if you need it. Reserve in advance."
11675,I love the GASLINE candy isle.
11676,"I like Wendy's in general but this particular location always gets my order wrong. I've never been there once & gotten all my food or had them give me the correct items. I've learned to never leave the premises without checking my food first. It can be a real pain having to check a larger order while the drive thru is packed so I usually end up pulling into the parking lot out of consideration for other patrons.... just to reveal that my order was messed up. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Which in turn usually leads to another trip thru the drive thru üò´ or before the construction, a trip inside.
The food is only hot and fresh 50% of the time but since I live in Fairbanks I have accepted that my food choices are limited. I don't go to Wendy's often but when I do I definitely know what to expect."
11677,Ring that bell!
11678,Hey everyone I just wanted to thank all of you who have left myself and the great company I work for Frontier all the amazing reviews it's been a pleasure working with each and every one of you.
11679,"It's good, I just wish the prices we lower for a combo."
11680,Best views of Sleeping Lady are from this point.
11681,"2020: Wonjo: My new favorite place, wife ordered me the best soup I never knew existed. Nice staff, organized and ready to go even with COVID happening.  Dishes were delicious and no complaints from anyone! Would return, would recommend, and would like to keep them in business.

2012: Tofu house: I have no complaints here, good food, fine service. Last I ate there the waitress kept bringing rounds of food and we certainly weren't complaining. Only bad time I had was when they got busted on a compliance check.."
11682,Know the mechanics personally. Very hard working honest men. Will be taking all my vehicles here when they need service or repair.
11683,Our go to pharmacy.
11684,Was amazing
11685,"Great place. Parking lot is always full of idiots, but, not a reflection of the service"
11686,They have free coffee(:
11687,Great coffee and atmosphere. Really good prices and free wifi too!
11688,"Great workers, they're always polite"
11689,Awesome staff good food and fun games
11690,"The food was delicious and quick.  It's so much faster and better tasting than ""fast"" food."
11691,Expensive for an outlet store. I found items cheaper at Fred Meyers
11692,"Best
4
Awesomeness"
11693,Sad that people can get out of there cars and stand in front of your car and stare into your car
11694,Budgeted stay and walking distance to shops and restaurants. Room is old but everything works.
11695,Kids enjoy it.
11696,"It's not the best Walmart in Anchorage, but depending on where I'm coming from, it's sometimes more convenient"
11697,"Good selection, and fresh veggies and fruits"
11698,The employees were friendly and helpful very nice shopping experience.
11699,Its ok
11700,Very nice store. Employee didn't know the merchandise and they did not have what I was looking for. Nevertheless nice place.
11701,"As usual, the review has to begin with the Alaska disclaimer.  Prices here are higher than most other places.  Why?  Because the cost of living is high in Alaska.  Bottom line, it doesn't matter where you are around Fairbanks, things are expensive.  That being said, this a cool place to stop in any time of the year.  Where else can your kids (or you adults) meet a very real-looking Santa in July, in North Pole?  Nowhere.  This place has a great selection of Alaskana items and souvenirs, as well as toys, books, and other Christmas items.  There's also a little coffee stand inside, very good during the winter events.  You don't have to buy anything, but if you venture into the Fairbanks area this is a must-see place.  It's a neat little shop that helps lend to a holiday, year-round.  I recommend everyone that visits the area stop by and check it out.  You won't be disappointed."
11702,Always a pleasant barista!!  Great and speedy service! ;
11703,Pizza is great
11704,"This place is always busy you need reservations but the beer is really good. The food is good we have gone back a few times, but mainly for the beer and atmosphere. It's not a great place for groups, we always seemed to get squished into their biggest tables but great for late night drinks and catching up with friends."
11705,"u can get great deli.
like hot chicken wings."
11706,Excellent halibut and salmon burgers.
11707,"The pho wasnt bad, but the shrimp pad Thai literally smelled and tasted like wet dog... I can't imagine what happened to make it smell that way. I couldn't give it away."
11708,Good service
11709,Great place for breakfast. Always busy on the weekend so plan accordingly.
11710,Great service and fantastic food.
11711,Always quick and easy for an oil change!
11712,"They make taco's, it's what they do. They also make nacho fries."
11713,Great small Filipino market.
11714,Traffic lights were slow but reasonable are you enjoying coming over to this side of town
11715,Fast service and good enough for when you don't feel like cooking
11716,Never enough cashiers and the ones they have are slower than ever
11717,I've had great experiences everytime I go in to eat of have a few drinks. Definitely recommend going.
11718,Omg so I had the Bison Sliders an WOW!! SOOO GOOD!! I also liked how there were Dinosaurs on top of the Tap station... .super cool! Also my first time with the Black Raven IPA... .super tasty!! Love this place!
11719,"Always a good time but they should really move it to Anchorage. The valley is getting too small to accommodate the number of visitors. Its a complete mess trying to get in, find parking and get out. It's becoming too big of a hassle to actually go anymore."
11720,Fantastic food and atmosphere.   Feels like home!
11721,it is ok
11722,The best chicken
11723,Always quiet and clean.
11724,It's a decent movie theater. I went to see the new Jurassic park movie and I didn't get the feeling like the movie theater is a dive spot. The only suggestion I would make is that a employee be present to make sure movies get started in each theater showing before leaving the projector room. Our movie didn't start and had to wait almost a half hour before someone restarted the computer so the movie would play. Other than that I would definately come back.
11725,"Good food, I really enjoy the sushi, and express combo has good variety. Service is great."
11726,Cleanest Walmart in town
11727,"Went to see have a look at cars with that flyer they send out. I was blocked at the door by a sales representative who was not friendly at all. I left with out looking at anything, and will not return there ever."
11728,It was a nice trip to Homer and was helpful for a map of the town and thing to do.
11729,Only location on lake otis has 8ft bays
11730,"Our favorite weekend breakfast place. 2 ""w/everything"" cheese omelet, 4 breakfast meats, fried potatoes, grits, toast x4, coffee and condiments for under $10. Microwave and self-service beverage concession. Clean, roomy, wall mounted tv's and friendly staff"
11731,Great
11732,"Typical Wendy's.  Predictable but tasty burgers, fries, and frostys."
11733,Feddies has it all really. Usually have what you need and always seem to have sales o.j. clothing and useful household items.
11734,Loved the chicken curry! Nice ambiance. Calm and soothing music during our lunch. Great service! First rate.
11735,Friendly staff and have recognized some friends everytime we go there.
11736,"(Translated by Google) Clean and tidy .. food home-style .. but far too large portions .. price-performance ratio ok

(Original)
Sauber und ordentlich.. Essen gutb√ºrgerlich.. aber viel zu grosse Portionen.. Preis-Leisungsverh√§ltnis ok"
11737,"I went in coming from Muldoon because I saw they had a good selection, which they did. The guy behind the counter was patient and friendly as I browsed. They didn't have some things I was looking for but that isn't a big deal. However the reason for the lack of star is because I asked a question about one of the items I bought, seeing if something inside was replaceable and the guy said no you need to buy a whole new unit. Well I bought it anyway, and I'm glad I did. Because on the box it clearly says it's replaceable. so other than being misinformed, I had a good visit."
11738,"Always love coming here. The baristas are always nice and cheery and fast! Drinks are good, too. I've never had a complaint. Thanks ladies!"
11739,Best sushi. I can rave about this place for 10 minutes!
11740,"Great food, ok Service, nice ambiance!"
11741,"Best pizza in town.  This is a landmark restaurant, the beer and pizza is so tasty"
11742,Beautiful facility.
11743,Friendly and was very quick
11744,"It was always dark whenever I came near this place, so I don't actually know what it's like.

Ah, who cares? 5 stars!"
11745,"Great food, service and beautiful waitresses."
11746,Fantastic service and good strong coffee. Thanks Cassi!
11747,Great meal options incl a bit healthier ones and cool bar with option to watch sports. And they serve Bulleit whiskey :)
11748,Great place to eat. Good service. Good food. Fair prices..
11749,I ordered medium cooked eggs and they were under cooked
11750,"Sometimes the sales help is friendly, sometimes it looks like they would rather stab a person than sell to them. They often cannot be found when needed. But, as I said... There are some lovely sales people there too."
11751,A great arts and crafts store. The staff are quite friendly and very helpful.
11752,It's Subway what else is needed to be said.
11753,Comfortable seats
11754,Always a great place to unwind and entertain!
11755,One of my top 3 places in Alaska for a romantic fine dining experience.
11756,New DMV!
11757,"Great place, no pressure at all from the sales team, will come back again"
11758,A nice place to shop people are friendly and I love to stop and have a Chi tea at kaladi brothers
11759,I got a gorgeous leather color pair of shoes!
11760,Excellent selection of local produce and products.
11761,The staff were helpful and polite nice place to shop.
11762,I went to Lowes because one of the managers said to bring my oven to the store and I could pick out another one. I was in the middle of baking bread for people and my oven fan went out again for the third time. My oven is electric. They didn't have the one I wanted in the entire state of Alaska. I wanted them to order the one I wanted and lend me a loaner until mine would come in 2-4 weeks. They had no electric range loaners. They had 1 cheap range for sale and that was it. They said to pick one of the floor models. I really didn't want any of them but I picked one because I needed something to cook with. The oven I have is horrible. The knobs are infront and not kid friendly...I have 7 kids. It's only one oven and the one I had and wanted replaced had 2 ovens. I am very unhappy. I cook all the time and feel like I was forced to settle for an oven I don't want all because they carry few electric ranges.
11763,The menu is a little pricey but the quality of the fish is better than any other sushi place I've been to in alaska
11764,Usually have whatever electronics I need
11765,"Compared to other places on this side of town, you have more beer options and different food choices that were not available at other venues. Highly recommend their steak tips."
11766,"Peter Pan Seafoods in Valdez, great place to buy local area processed seafood (vacuum packed) bulk & single, always good, they only operate during the summer so they can run short by the end of the season."
11767,Great food!
11768,"It was good.  Actually very good for a hot dog. But is was a little high priced for a hot dog, too. They don't have fountain drinks."
11769,Been going to F Street since 1977. Always have enjoyed the  awesome food they serve and the Specials.
11770,Delicious
11771,Freaking amazing coffee and cheesecake. At first I was mad because the price of cheesecake is not displayed on the menu and it looked so good in the case I just had to order some. I was surprised when my bill came out to 20 bucks for 2 pieces of cheese cake and a 4 dollar espresso. The slices were $8 each but honestly worth every penny. Best cheesecake I've ever had!
11772,"Killer food at high but not horrific prices with an emphasis on local grown everything they can, a fine theater, and a good array of beers and two top-tier house-made sodas make this one of the best brewpubs in the city.

Be aware, the downstairs bar is open seating - be prepared to hunt for a seat. If you're willing to be patient, dining room reservations upstairs are lower stress but may take an hour or even two."
11773,"Great place, friendly staff and good stock."
11774,Very helpful people!!
11775,"Good selection of stores, but mostly chain stores, not much local stuff."
11776,"Poor quality of several dishes, surly wait staff. I don't live in Anchorage so several years since last visits. Brought guests very disappointed."
11777,"Great customer service, great selection of bikes, good deals."
11778,"My Monday breakfast place, love it!"
11779,"Extremely HOT inside, usually only one register open so you have to wait a good 10+ minutes for food."
11780,"Good donuts, but they do not have the specials offered by their notifications.  At least for the items I have tried.  I always feel like they are the poster bearer for 'bait and switch.'  Not on the top of my list of places to return."
11781,Excellent service and very friendly
11782,We love stopping in for lunch or dinner. Large portions of wonderful food. Captains Platter or Halibut Fish and Chips are our favorites.
11783,I joined several friends here for lunch. And I ordered a sandwich from the very small menu and it was not available (and they had only just opened for business). So my second choice was far from great and I ended up throwing half of it away so I don't think I will be stopping here again.  This was my 5th attempt to like this place and it just doesn't get any better...
11784,"Great service, very efficient and friendly and very knowledgeable.  I would recommend to anyone. They fixed my galaxy watch in 1 day with no issues. Thanks."
11785,"BEST food in Juneau, always the BEST service, just LOVE this place."
11786,"Rest assured folks! With a masterful technician like James Hatter on staff, I know my vehicle will be back on the road and better than ever in no time!! Thanks Kendall of Wasilla!!"
11787,Awesome work! Anthony did mine and my boyfriend's tatoos. They turned out amazing! Very professional.
11788,Lots of beautiful animals. Love it.
11789,Always great service with a smile. Everyone is so lovely.
11790,Very nice and helpful staff.
11791,Very slow late note service.
11792,"Nice interior decor and very friendly staff, but unfortunately this is where it take a sharp turn to unpleasantvill. The food was beyond bland and lacked any resemblance  of what I ordered."
11793,Best organic selection and one stop shopping for a busy mom of six üëçüëç
11794,Nice lake can drive on ice durring winter.
11795,"The Outlaw is one of the best drinks I've ever had. These folks really care about making a good drink, and always have a big smile. Highly recommended."
11796,Man nothing like eating great even late
11797,"It‚Äôs one of the smaller Tesoros but if you‚Äôre on the side of town, it‚Äôs good to get gas and a quick snack. I dont see druggies or homeless ppl here much so thats why i gave it 5stars otherwise its its a decision gas station."
11798,"Local favorite. If in doubt, the #10 is very popular. Foodies and regular humans will be pleased."
11799,It's ok.
11800,Not as good as Fred's but a closer option to the valley
11801,It's a Walmart
11802,Sometimes you just want a pita
11803,Love the Philly cheese steak omelet!
11804,Food is good service good I'll be back
11805,"Its the trail you can bring grandma on. Its usually slippery because the roots of the trees are usually wet, but its a very easy walk."
11806,Friendly and great service.
11807,The employees are working hard to keep the shelves stocked and are pleasant to talk to in the fishing department
11808,Great job
11809,"Had the first date night in a long time, and glacier brewhouse was the perfect choice. Great atmosphere and great food!"
11810,Tasty Irish recipes with other American favorites as well.  The bar is endless for the adventurous but the Irish Staples are the best. Have St. Patty's day anytime at Mcginley's!
11811,"(Translated by Google) Sales service Telephony and equipment

11812,Good food. Reasonably priced. Excellent hot sauce collection.
11813,"Bad customer service,  manager is the worst"
11814,We went to the holiday bazaar there easy to get around and great selection of venders
11815,This place was great. From the time until you walk through the door everyone was nice and courteous. They have some great exhibits. If you are in the area this is a must visit.
11816,Great pizza!
11817,"Seafood chowder, oysters, jam, eggs, spinach, coffee, and sweet treats!
===Seafood chowder from Tamera's Seafood is divine, absolutely divine. The cream broth is delicate, with a sheen of butter?margarine floating on the surface. Not thick like some chowders. Thus, the slice of white bread served with it? Meh. Thin and floppy...think wonder bread. Such exquisite chowder should be served either with a THICK SLICE OF FRENCH BREAD OR crispy, salty oyster crackers instead.
===Speaking of oysters...
Fresh oysters from Jakolof Bay Oyster co. are meaty, buttery, and tangy. AT 2.00 each shucked, go ahead, get a dozen and slurp away-- add a squeeze of fresh lemon or a splash of garlic onion vinagrette and OMG your tastebuds will do the happy dance. The sellers incorporate a single bladed hand shucker, as opposed to other sellers at other markets that use a mechanical shucker. The result is that you'll slurp your treats one at a time, as each is shucked rather than have a plateful handed to you or whatever number you've ordered. And, you may have to wait your turn as the single shucker shucks an oyster for multiple paying customers. Again, I highly recommend a mechanical shucker. Serves more people faster.
===The Blueberry jam from Bob's is best eaten with a spoon straight out of the jar, or slathered on warm buttered toast. Make sure the bread can support the weight of the jam, however, or you'll just have mess when the bread disintegrates under the weight of the jam. Suggest a HEFTY slice of multigrain wheat bread.
===Farm fresh eggs from Bob make superb fried overeasy eggs. The yolk is thick and saffron colored.
So, a meal of fresh eggs, blueberry jam, and oysters, sounds delicious.
====Rhubarb lemonade is a buck, but is more like plain pink lemonade. It is made from the water that rhubarb is boiled in to make jam. So, I give the seller credit for making use of the rhubarb infused water.
===We bought a 1/2 dozen precious notecards decorated with ravens of all colors engaging in crafty raven activities. The seller was an enchanting woman with a broad smile and a willingness to chat. ====Now, you will pay sales tax on the handicrafts. Go ahead pay it, don't whine about it. Some guy---who actually lives in Homer was giving a young sales lady grief about paying the sales tax (2.00--that's two dollars) on his purchase.
She was most gracious with this less than gracious customer.
===The handicrafts are priced as good artwork should be and the tax is what it is.
===Parking is free, and is a bit of a rodeo. The one way single entrance/exit are NOT well marked. The market is at the crest of a hill on the upside of a curve.
====Traffic is heavy...(it is summer, and thus tourists like me flock to Homer). We accidentally entered at the exit, and there was no way to back out of it as it would have put us into oncoming traffic. Visibility is poor if you are at the exit trying to exit, especially if a vehicle is entering the exit (like we did) and blocks the view. Thanks to a couple of gracious out going drivers, we were able to wiggle our Subaru between the two cars and slip into a nearby parking space.
====On the other hand, take a couple of sturdy tote bags and walk."
11818,Had a special for oil change and inspection and tire rotation.  Had to have an appointment. Only did half of it. Waited around for it. After all that time I  just left. Didn't want to wait for them any longer.

11826,They are always busy so the food is always fresh!
11827,"I love taking my kids here, even more so now with the all you can play deals. My friend only complaint is the cost of the all you can play passes keeps increasing at too high a rate. When the deal first came out it was much more reasonable."
11828,"Joined this week to try some of the group sessions because I am bored with working out alone. The day after I join and register for the group sessions I‚Äôm interested in, they remove all sessions for two weeks. I only joined for the sessions because I have two gyms at work I can use for free. When I called and inquired about it, they didn‚Äôt offer me a refund, discount or anything when I basically can‚Äôt use the service I paid for. I understand things come up but how can they only have one instructor for all of the sessions with no substitute? And then refuse to compensate for a lack of advertised services?"
11829,"Makes my day better every time I go, SUPER happy people who actually care about your day! I won't go anywhere else in the valley. Drove 11 miles just to go there today!"

11838,Such an amazing experience this morning. Place wasn't as busy as I was expecting. The new location is much larger than their other location. Many more tables and the same great menu and culture that makes Kavas great. The portions are massive and the prices are super fair for the amount of food your gonna get.

11853,"Best pizza in Anchorage, hands down. Love this place and looking forward to coming back."
11854,Food was good
11855,"Everytime I walk in, everyone is friendly.  I bought my car from here and the experience was good. I knew what I wanted and how much I was willing to spend. They definitely worked with me to make everything smooth!! I recommend the body shop on Dimond over this one !! They dont seem to have there stuff together and if your going to spend the prices they charge the shop  on Dimond is definitely better and faster!!  I feel the Dimond shop cares more about fixing your car correctly and in a timely manner!"

11861,"This is an unassuming and little known store front where local native Alaskans weave and knit qiviut garments.  Qiviut is fiber collected from wild musk ox that is processed into yarn.  Local village women knit this yarn into mostly hats and scarves that are amazingly warm, water resistant and lightweight.  It's the warmest natural fiber known.  It is a hidden gem if you are visiting Alaska and are seeking a unique and genuine Alaskan gift."
11862,Whenever I am in town I always look to see the prices of gasoline at Costco. Most of the time the gas prices are much cheaper than majority of other gas stations.
11863,All you can eat. Not dry foods.

11865,Must stop! Fantastic opportunity to see Alaskan animals up close and personal. Clean and well maintained property.
11866,"Great coffee, but the price is pretty high."
11867,"OMG eat here. We had the ham and cheese croissant, yum. The sticky buns, to die for. Our friends had the biscuits and gravy, there are no words. When we got home and told people we were in Homer, they were like, ‚Äúdid you go to Two Sisters?‚Äù It is really that good. Check the hours though, they are not open everyday."

11876,for GOOD service sit in the BAR.  If you want terrible to mediocre service sit in the other part.   Food is not bad.  Pizza is good.  Enjoy eating there now I know where to sit to get good service.   Takeout can be hit or miss.
11877,sucks... don't go in the afternoon. All the units send their troops there to do PT in the afternoon. Awful place to work out if you PT in the morning like every other soldier on post and want to do some weight training in the afternoon.
11878,Great view of Ketchikan. Well maintained
11879,"Very spacious, very open and lovely service. Would recommend for long shopping."
11880,"Pleasant and good service. Reasonable prices for the area and even better food. I have eaten here many times. I have had quite a few different dishes and they were all very good and the salad bar might be the best in the state, and I travel all over for work."
11881,There was a lot more there than I was expecting

11889,Great service
11890,Line out of the parking lot. Tried to leave and circled the parking lot 2 times because of chaotic lot.
11891,"They're grilled cheese sandwiches are decent. Meat and cheese nothing too extraordinary, however they really excel with their bread. Crisped to perfection and a wide assortment of fresh bread available. Soup is usually decent as well, definitely a lunch favorite in Girdwood."
11892,"I'm a huge BBQ fan, so finding out this was a place endorsed by Guy Fieri had me all sorts of excited! To start with, the food here was good. I had brisket with potato salad and garden salad. The wait staff was also excellent. I enjoyed talking with the bartender, and she made some winning recommendations for which beer I should try next. They make their own in-house sauces too - which are amazingly good! My problem was with the portions. I left still wanting more. But it was late and the kitchen had already shut down by the time I asked about ordering more food. I've been to plenty of other BBQ places though while I've been traveling. This ranks right up there in taste but lacking in portions. This is even considering that I was given extra salad by accident. The salad went surprisingly well with kolsch by the way. Can't say I enjoy beer with my salad very often, but I did here! This place is definitely worth stopping in to grab a bite. Just be prepared to still be rummaging for munchies later when you get home. I've went to other places with comparable prices and served so much food I had to take half of it home for an entire 2nd meal the next day. This is not the case here, unless you splurge for the pig out platter. Again, excellent food and wait staff, lacking in portions for the price. But it's also possible that brisket is more expensive for them to get up here with COVID too. I dropped over $20 on food here, not including drinks, so I'll leave a picture and let you decide. Again, excellent taste but just wish there was a little more."
11893,Love the name!
11894,It's a Papa John's in Soldotna.
11895,"Great food, small menu, awesome Service."
11896,Love the place and the costumer service is awesome!
11897,Great scenery!
11898,Go! Even in rain & snow this place is beautiful. Trails near visitor centers were good. We saw a variety of wildlife and took lots of pictures.
11899,"Good family place,  toys for kids to play on and lots of grass to roll around on.  The Campbell trail along side it and the creek also is here."
11900,Found out there foods are days old no thank you....

11903,Best smoked salmon ever.

11907,Had tons of fun! Want a bit on some pull tabs and had a great night that was much less expensive than ever expected! Excellent customer service!
11908,Best prepared internet service 110%
11909,I would patronize another store before Great Northern Guns their staff should be in a different line of work .  With that said I'd rather pay more elsewhere than ever stop in there again.
11910,Good customer service!
11911,great service and amazing view
11912,My husband and I had breakfast here before we boarded the ferry. We a harbor table with great views and breakfast and coffee were delicious! Great customer service with a smile!
11913,"Great 24 hr service, and delicious food at a modest price."
11914,"Delicious treats, a Homer classic."
11915,Good service even for the large group I was with
11916,This place is really nice but the seating isn't little tight
11917,Mcgriddle my stuff right there
11918,Nice store for camping clothes but it seems overpriced not sure about thatin my opinion there are better in-store programs around town though
11919,Small and clean. Real nice wood log cabin office. Great mt view. Not on highway so its slightly more quiet. Full hookups. Actual space between lots!!! Firepit + picnic table.
11920,"Natalie gave me a halfmoon manicure that was super fast and well done. I also got a pedicure at the same time (excellent time management!) and am incredibly happy with the results. I can't reach my toes right now because I'm 8 months pregnant and having someone help my feet to feel better is so wonderful. The only reason I deducted a star is because the decor could use sprucing up and the price list could use updating, since they have slightly different prices than what are posted. I will definitely be back! You'll find more details on their Facebook page than you will on Google."
11921,"Service takes a really long time. Food is pretty good, but you can only go if you have the time.

Update: PC has improved a lot! Served right away and greeted by staff. Excellent service and excellent food"
11922,Reasonably priced  items.  Clean. the grandmas cookies went up to 1.19. Fat lady at the front doesnt want me there shes a fat lady
11923,Good place for sweets down in Seward!
11924,Amazing place amazing guys that work hard to make sure everything I own runs great they fix their mistakes they make sure everything is taken care of when I have to come back for something they make sure I know it's done right
11925,They have increased their prices so now it is about 12 dollars a lunch. But it is still one of the best sushi places on the west coast and we'll worth the money.
11926,"My second visit...Dipped nails lasted a long time without pealing and very few chips.
Joe did a wonderful job while keeping a smile on my face...very personable."
11927,Good food
11928,"Don't let the line fool you. For as long as it was, it was worth the wait and it kept moving consistently. Amazing food as always and before I got to the window to pick up my order someone brought it out to me. Amazing service."
11929,Honestly best place to get a haircut in town; friendly staff and good prices for a cut. Even in a pandemic they are great people to work with and highly worth the wait to get a haircut from.
11930,Great selection of libations.
11931,Samplers are a must have!!
11932,"Good location, new equipment, and very clean.  Prices are a little on the high side, but everything is expensive ......  it's Seward.
The new hours of business are much more friendly towards its customer base.
All in all, it's not a great place to go do your laundry just because it's the only open to the public laundromat in this area.  :-D"
11933,Very clean and I'm for one am overjoyed this gym is open
11934,The food was ok. Nice small town feeling on the inside and the staff was friendly
11935,JBC all the way. Chili and potato are good too.
11936,"Why go to Panda Express when you can go here for literally the same price? Plus, the portions are bigger. A+ in my book. This place is a gem in a box of rhinestones. Just try it."

11953,Best movie theater in town. ;)
11954,"Sometimes the food is good, other times it's not, too inconsistent for me. Try Marcello's or just go to Anchorage."
11955,Definitely fun to go to the movies but at this one be prepared to fly through cash for four people 39 bucks for tickets plus popcorn two energy drinks 18 bucks and the two big fountain sodas 16 bucks  spent nearly 70 bucks here for me and some friends better to buy some microwave popcorn a drink from a gas station and the disc so you can watch it endlessy

11957,Nice place to look around
11958,Great food and friendly service
11959,"Campobellos is a lovely place for lunch with friends or a romantic dinner for two. A simple, understated elegance surrounds you as you dine. Very easy to converse as there was no loud music or clanging of dishes. Our waiter was attentive and friendly! The crepes! Delicious!"
11960,Had the Alaska Supreme Burger with the Texas toothpicks.  Food was good and service was amazing. The vibe of the place is that of a 50s diner. Was fun and enjoyable.
11961,Nice place drink beer sitting outside and enjoying the weather and beautiful harbor
11962,Nice paved trail that runs through the city.
11963,"Good service, product"
11964,Nice place hassle-free
11965,Tonight will be my last time at pizzahut. The crew is unprofessional  & needs retraining with sanitation. At least have a manager on the floor. Got my garlic boneless wings smothered in Cesar dressing instead of garlic sauce.
11966,It was really good especially their neon bowling but I found the staff to be kind of pushy and not nice in general
11967,nice clean store. friendly staff. well stocked.
11968,"I was impressed with the waiter , my steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned no need for a1 r catsup. my salad was crisp fresh and perfectly balanced wirh the house dressing. The bartender was just getting threw her dinner rush as we came in. so the manager gave her a well earned break , i asked for a bloody mary while she was on . the manager named heather was amazingly friendly, and even behind the mask .i could see her smile with buoyant personality making me feel at home .plus she made me the best damn bloody mary ive ever had !!

11970,I love there grooming department they are always very caring when i bring my dog and my moms dog in to be groomed
11971,Love this little place - always great food. Be patient and don't be in a hurry here!
11972,"Not happy with their service, the one at Seward Meridian and Palmer/Wasilla hwy.
Needs to have a talk with the employees, they where acting inappropriate, using bad language and loudly arguing with each other.
I will definitely think twice about going back"
11973,A real delight and I learned so much about Alaska.
11974,We donated trying to win. We had fun with friends of family.
11975,Very nice and informative. Recommend the experience
11976,Good food  a place where the waitress calls you honey or sweetie and remember your name
11977,"If you had told me that one could find authentic and pleasant Mexican food in Anchorage, I would have been surprised. Gallos is exceptional! I recommend their Espinaca con Queso - really wonderful and spicy spinach dip. Friendly atmosphere, excellent food, and a good experience overall."
11978,It's ok
11979,"I was not impressed with this place at all. The breading on the chicken was so thick it didn't stick to the chicken at all. The chicken was also the huge, on roids kind. There wasn't even really seasoning going on with it either. I'm not sure if I'm missing something or what. Best thing I had there was the ceasar salad. The cheese curds were okay. Wouldn't order again. Since this place is semi new maybe they need some time to perfect their recipes."
11980,Good service
11981,Transaction was botched..over charged me..went back and took 30 minutes to get it corrected...customer service was good..they were very apologetic...the bed covering I bought I had to repair...
11982,"Burgers, fries and shakes are very good. They're ""famous"" for their pan fried chicken üçó, but I don't know what the big deal is. There's no seasoning on it, none at all. It's just chicken fried in oil! That's all you taste, chicken and oil."
11983,Good food and great help
11984,Delicious indian food. Cook was super accommodating and helped us a lot with what to order to mine and my boyfriends preferences. Spectacular customer service. Will definitely be going again!
11985,"Fantastic service, Tim!"
11986,Good fast service
11987,"We have had our belongings in there for about 6 months now and it has been hassle free. Great customer service when we initially set everything up, easy payment every month, and peace of mind that our belongings are in good hands. Best Storage, is truly the best in town as far as we're concerned"
11988,I loved every thing! We go almost every weekend!
11989,Took a friend to do laundry place was cheap for laundry But I wasn't impressed with the cleanly ness
11990,Amazing food.
11991,"Came in for dog tags, which are far higher quality than the DIY engraver 'vending machines' (for lack of a better term), and while wandering the store as tbey engraved, discovered they have all the bits and pieces to build or repair dog collars/harnesses. Saved me a ton of time and effort trying to find the stuff I needed online!"
11992,"Great, quick, professional experience."
11993,"I like that you can make appointments online and at the very last minute. It was interesting to have the exam with a doctor that wasn't in the room, but on a webcam. It works. They have decent prices on glasses and a fairly good selection of frames."
11994,My Father got taken here after a horrible fire accident the day before thanksgiving. So they sent him to the burn unit and after that he got sent to the Critical Care Unit. He was on life support and barely hanging on. Lots of skin graphs and surgeries. He is a fighter and the most strongest man I have ever met. But he had the best team of Doctors and CNAs. Always contacting me no matter what it was I knew. The best care I could ever ask for. They saved my dads life. They gave him the best treatment and treated him so kind. The Doctors also cared for the emotional state of my grandfather and I too. Within a 2 months of him fighting for his life he was able to get off of life support and put a reversible Trach in. He got that out in 2 weeks and now is moved out of the Critical Care Unit and is in the Recovery Unit. They did everything they had to do. Always 100% on top of everything. I never questioned anything they wanted to do. I believe in everyone of these Doctors in this hospital and I couldn‚Äôt Thank the team of Doctors enough for saving my Fathers life.
11995,Order is always fresh and correct. The drive through is a little slow.
11996,The security who does the passes here are awesome very quick to get your pass and efficiently they are polite and easy going they don't get the reconition they deserve you guys rock!! :-)
11997,A waste of my time
11998,"Usually great prices with good sales that saves a decent amount of money.
Selections are huge and makes it easy to find something for everyone.

I have yet to see more than 2 or 3 registers ever open at the same time and sometimes the wait at the deli and hot food are too long even with only 1 person in line.

I use the app and it helps to save money and get fuel points which is hugely helpful."

12013,Very friendly staff. Took the bus from train depot in park to hotel. Very nice shuttle driver!

12020,"I had fried shrimps that were too salty, and the fries seemed to be reheated."
12021,"Found hair in my food. They took it off the bill, and made me a new plate, but i am pretty scarred. I picked through it throughly before eating. The service was good, that's why i gave 2 stars instead of 1. The replacement plate was so greasy. I wasn't the only one with issues, and people behind me had a plate sent back too."
12022,Great spot! What a surprise. If I lived in Kenai I‚Äôd be here all the time.
12023,I love Pad Thai!
12024,"NeighborWorks is a really good place to find out information about subsidized housing. They offer many programs to assist Alaskans get into a home of their own. Many of the programs that they offer focus on home ownership, they even offer free classes so that you can learn about owning a home and what it takes to be a successful homeowner. I definitely recommend it to people who are looking for rental assistance or a path to home ownership."
12025,Awesome place to spend a sunny day.
12026,Totally Awesome! My filet mignon was cooked to perfection.  I would recommend  it to anyone. The service was prompt also. Great experience.

12028,Greasy and soggy fries
12029,Good food and service
12030,It usually good food but today the chicken taste like cooking twice and thay sent me to the back of the building to wait for my 3 applepies and then they argue about my potatoes and gravy and  was not on the bag with the food but mind you who puts potatoes and gravy and in with the chicken setting up sideways probably spling if he really gav it to me didn't even give me a my biscuits and slammed the door in my face..
12031,So good. Fresh and fast.
12032,"Great food & excellent service! Ravioli with alfredo sauce, very cool!!! Last time I was here I just wanted simple spaghetti and meatballs. That'sjust what I got, it was perfect. The spaghetti noodles were perfect, the sauce was clean and refreshing, full of flavor yet not heavy. The meatballs were great, could of been a stand alone meal, would of made a great sandwich."
12033,"Has everything you would ever need. Customer service is one of the better Walmarts I've been to. Going there recently, understanding COVID-19, some people weren't wearing masks."
12034,"Great place to get wasted. I‚Äôve blacked out at the Mecca countless times. Saw a drunk girl take a dump on the dance floor, classic Mecca!"
12035,Always busy. Overrated but still an ok experience.
12036,"Friendly, efficient staff, wanting to help you get in the car you need and very fair and understanding."

12054,Always excellent food
12055,Nice clean gym with great childcare and pool area!
12056,"Me and a group of 3 others came here for our first time, and we were not disappointed. All of our dishes were meticulously made, with an amazing touch of taste. We had a very country style breakfast; consisting of various combinations of hash browns, bacon, sausages, potatoes, 8"" chocolate pancakes, a huge waffle. The only exception was the coffee, I feel bad to give them 4 stars because of coffee. But coffee is the highest priority for me."
12057,Great place
12058,Service was fast. There was a nice quiet atmosphere. Plates were large and filling.
12059,Good gym with good equipment. Avoid if possible during pt hours and around 16-1700 as these are the busiest times. Pretty much dead over lunch.

12061,It's great every year! This year I went to the DNCE concert. Bring them back next year!
12062,Fun place for kids. Watch out for creepers.
12063,"If you‚Äôre looking for low quality flower or a hit and miss when it comes to concentrates, then this place is perfect for you."
12064,Like home Mexican food at a decent price.
12065,They have the most reasonable prices in fairbanks but it's Wal-Mart so the waits are long the employees are clueless and you MUST avoid it on the first of the month.
12066,They always please you. Good mexican food and the garcias mexi burger is to die for
12067,"I went to sell a few guns that weren't getting any use. Employees were very nice and helpful, if somewhat inept when it came to the computer system."
12068,Six slides my grandbeeb loves it!
12069,Always got great help when I‚Äôve used their services usually when switching out phones. Staff has always been friendly

12072,Decent size
12073,Such homewood!  Very wow!
12074,"JVS is a Barbershop  were  you can bring you kids. Well mannered and professional barbers and Great Cuts at a reasonable price. As a Barber from the lower 48 we value our customers, I use to work at @JDSTLYES but after two years of over taxing customers is enough is enough and it's hard to set a fair rate whenever your booth rent is extra high for no logical business reasons besides greed. Juan valued my barbering knowledge and educational experience skills and performance firsthand he respects as a human first. Professionalism at finest. So if anyone who is looking for.. MoGee da barber a.k.a Terrance who use to work @Jdstlyes. I now work @JVS.
Thank you and stay blessed"
12075,"Its cheap, no one ever talks to me and the equipment always seems well kept up. Great gym for a casual fitness experience."
12076,An excellent place to eat ice cream. I just wish the road wasn't so narrow to get here.
12077,24 hour donuts is nice.
12078,"Great trail, it was not easy but definitely worth the effort. Beautiful views!"
12079,"Nice place, great waitress, lots of leftovers!"
12080,I miss the old seats.

12086,Found all that I need for Life!!!
12087,"Best place in town for a beer and live music, + camping right off the deck with a great view"
12088,This place is very clean. The staff is very helpful and caring. I was amazed at how many people were there looking for a new pet or to get help with the ones they have. Please check this place out if your looking for a pet.
12089,Ketchikan mall
12090,How in the hell do you not have a decent donut selection - enough for a dozen donuts - at 8:30 in the morning? The word 'donut' is right in your name.
12091,Great staff respectable prices and an okay selection of matresses. If you want a matress to last through the duty station but don't want to be berated by name brand salespeople give it a shot
12092,"A little hard to find, but an easy ""hike"". The glacier view is not that impressive but the scenery is beautiful. Keep in mind, during the off season, the visitors center nearby is closed. No bathroom. Deserted feeling about the place."
12093,"For some reason my order was bad. There was shells in my fried rice, I'm still trying to recover from food sickness. I got diarrhea,  puked all it out. I dont know. Before it was great but not this order. Very unpleasant being sick. :("
12094,Seemed kool
12095,"Beautiful place with friendly staff, amazing wine and incredible food! I wish we were local so we could become regulars! The food is also very reasonably priced. My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere greatly!"
12096,Best Mexican food
12097,"Wow at the scenery and even more spectacular aerial views!

George Parks Highway (numbered Interstate A-4 and signed Alaska Route 3), usually called the Parks Highway, runs 323 miles (520 km) from the Glenn Highway 35 miles (56 km) north of Anchorage to Fairbanks in the Alaska Interior. The highway, originally known as the Anchorage-Fairbanks Highway, was completed in 1971, and given its current name in 1975.

The highway, which mostly runs parallel to the Alaska Railroad, is one of the most important roads in Alaska. It‚Äôs the main route between Anchorage and Fairbanks. Alaska's two largest metro areas. The highway is the main thoroughfare  to Denali National Park and Preserve and Denali State Park + the main highway in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. The route's Interstate designation is not properly signed. The entire length of the highway is marked as Alaska Route 3."
12098,Awesome people to work with. Very knowledgeable and friendly. They also spent about 30 minutes on the phone with me hunting down a receipt I had lost. Can't beat that.
12099,"This is based on my experiences going to Gerry's since I was a kid for 20 years now.

Details to know:
*Family owned and operated - GERRY senior has been running it for decades, and now GERRY Jr. And his daughter EVA also cut hair here -
*Walk-ins only
*Cash-only with 2 ATMs nearby

Thoughts:
*Each Barber here has their own specialty and character - GERRY Sr. Specializes in excellent traditional cuts / GERRY Jr. Is quick and excellent at a much wider range of cuts / EVA is excellent at detail work and unique requests.

Cliff notes:
*Hours of operation are posted, though occasional family vacations and weather may see the shop closed outside of expected timeframes.
*Great place for all ages - kids are welcome to try out new styles / adults are welcome, whether you've got the longest hair or are bald and need it cut to skin, they'll take care of you."
12100,"This mom and pop restaurant had some super great sandwiches, I would recommend this to everyone!!!! üíúüòçüëç"
12101,Love our Little Local Coffee Shop!!
12102,Great food and friendly staff
12103,Came to 9 am mass which was posted on website and on phone answering messages.  Only to stand there and no mass after all. Guess this wasn't worth updating for out of state visitors.  Sad!
12104,Great stylists there make you feel comfortable
12105,Very friendly staff
12106,Great food with great prices. Their food is awesome with good portions. My wife and I love to eat here.
12107,"Been here quite a few times. Food good quality. Last two times were disappointing. A week ago the hostess made our group of 15 feel like we were a burden. And frankly was a b*%>ch. Today during a performance from our favorite band in the rain, with the smallest crowd we have seen yet it took over an hour to get our meals. 3 of us this time. Some simple salads and a burger. Foot needs to be applied to the a$$ of the cook staff. Cost our server $20 in tips."
12108,Great place. Just pull in and they take care of the oil. No waiting outside.
12109,Name brand items if you are into the outdoors.  They have something for everyone. Staff was helpful.
12110,"It has been while since I have been and I didn't have long to look around, some stores have closed or moved to other locations.  But having a mall is still a nice and dry/warm alternative to being outside.  Or being where there is no shopping."
12111,"Cute gift and candy store,  a little pricier than the others."
12112,Can do everything online with no contact which is awesome! Plus you get to choose your own gate code so it's easier to remember!
12113,I love this place!!! Great place to take my family on winter days to get that energy out. Different things to do to keep everyone busy.
12114,"Great service! Rachel is so helpful, and beautiful."
12115,"Obviously nobody goes to the Retinal Secialist because they are having a great time!  But the care I received on each of my half dozen or so appointments was phenomenal.  Their newly remodeled space and covid conscious cleanings made me feel right at home.  The streamlined process from check-in to check-out was efficient, professional and friendly.  Dr. Bushad (probably spelling that wrong) or ‚ÄúChad‚Äù as he asked to be called was perhaps the best Doctor of any kind in any medical field I have encountered.  His ability to relate complex medical names and procedures in understandable terms was much appreciated.  Everyone in the office seemed like they really enjoyed being there and helping people.  I honestly hope I never need to see another Retinal Specialist but if I do this is definitely where I will return. Highly recommend!!"
12116,Very friendly employees. Facility was clean and we'll kept.
12117,You will always see something and somebody that you can go home and have a conversation about..
12118,Good place to relax
12119,"Nice store, clean, and friendly. Smaller though, not as much selection as the Anchorage store."
12120,"Enjoyable morning walk in our neighborhood. The Eagle River is frozen right now, though likely not for long. To hear the crunch of crusted snow underfoot while the river still rushes under ice is an auditory gift. When the sun is out (and even when it‚Äôs not) any trail along the Eagle River promises spectacular scenery. Walking on waves frozen as if they were tectonic plates is precarious but equally exciting. Good walking poles and cleats help in the winter. I‚Äôd suggest poles for summer treks as well. Walking near rivers requires caution, no matter the season. Enjoy but keep a safe distance from open water. Don‚Äôt try to cross in any conditions less than ideal and without proper training or assistance. Remember, bears frequent the area in Spring, Summer and Fall, moose as well."
12121,Nice and affordable place to stay for the area. Centrally located and comfortable beds with everything you need in the room.  People hanging around out front can be a little dodgy but they‚Äôve got security at all times and the front door is locked at all times to people without keys. Would stay here again for sure
12122,Awesome place to eat with family. I always enjoy going for breakfast with my wife.
12123,"The Zoo is awesome, plenty of parking, and nice gift shop. Some of the animals tend to shy away from the public and hide. The wolves, bears, and musk ox is a sight to see."
12124,"A pricey but very nice place to stay. The best part was the shuttle that would take you 'down town' or to other locations to meet your tours of the main park. We paid the up-charge for the 'room with a view' and it was totally worth it.
We ate that the restaurant and then at the cafe once each and it was way too expensive for what you get, but it was yummy still.
Very friendly staff and a lot of cool decorations and photos to see all around. The shuttle drivers were especially friendly! Keep an eye out for wildlife!"
12125,Just drove by but looking to fully explore it soon!
12126,Good for basic make haircuts
12127,"Have been a couple of times since intial review below the mozzarella bread is good, ceaser dressing unique with a slight kick, fam likes the Aloha and I like the backpacker with Canadian Bacon added.
Our past couple of servers have been wonderful.

More hype than anything and the drinks are pretty good. It is crowded, expensive, and you can get pretty much get better pizza anywhere else in Anchorage. Get take away if you want to try it and you can have a beer while you wait."
12128,Town of Ketchikan. Great place to visit. So many shops and things to see and to eat.
12129,Great place to waste few hours on the mountain.
12130,"I went in coming from Muldoon because I saw they had a good selection, which they did. The guy behind the counter was patient and friendly as I browsed. They didn't have some things I was looking for but that isn't a big deal. However the reason for the lack of star is because I asked a question about one of the items I bought, seeing if something inside was replaceable and the guy said no you need to buy a whole new unit. Well I bought it anyway, and I'm glad I did. Because on the box it clearly says it's replaceable. so other than being misinformed, I had a good visit."
12131,"This is one of my favorite special places to go for a celebration. The service is amazing and the Filet Mignon is the best I have honestly ever had. And if you are in for a nice night at a wine bar, with music playing at 10 pm, this is a great local spot to enjoy a fun night."
12132,Very iconic historic beach with easy walking paths that weave in and out of the old mine compound.
12133,"Nice local coffee shop with bakery. Excellent ambience, baked goods are fine. Their fresh bread and pastries are probably the best offering. Quiche is similar to custard in texture, bagel sandwiches are less greasy/cheesy than others around. Good espresso."
12134,I like that there is simple green to use as pre-wash. This time of year my rims won't get  clean enough with it.
12135,Friendly and helpful.
12136,Good food. Nice and clean.
12137,Amazing food great service .. Fresh always
12138,I bought an unlimited wash package. It's totally worth it. I wash my car several times a week now.
12139,Love this place. Huge burritos and fulfilling! Would recommend anyone to try this place
12140,Great prices!
12141,"Best pizza on the peninsula. Affordable lunch, six dollars two slices and a soda, from noon till 4. Delivery and carry out, also inexpensive, best deal for the best pie."
12142,Helpful staff and a great atmosphere.
12143,Love it!
12144,Excellent customer service here.  Very fast
12145,I love Costco
12146,Excellent food! Average service.
12147,"Best food on the Kenai Penninsula. They do know how to cook a steak the way you want it 9/10 times. Which down here is exceptional. The bread they bring out is something to make the trip alone for.
All the decor is enough to keep you entertained while you wait as well.
The only mark against may be that they are so busy with limited seating. Approx 16 tables and 2 for large parties. Go late...thats my suggestion. Enjoy!!"
12148,Beautiful new location
12149,Batman dies in endgame
12150,Paid over the amount due on my credit card and at&t said it would take till friday before my phone is on????????... bad customer relations
12151,Cold drinks. Honestly we never ate here. Just had drinks so can't comment on the food.
12152,It's a cute trendy touristy shop. Perfect for buying gifts for females.
12153,"Big Ray's had everything we needed and more. The prices were competitive, and fair. The products are high quality name brand. I point that out because while we were there someone was complaining Walmart was cheaper for the same ""type"" of clothes. That doesn't speak to the quality of the Walmart clothes to hold up or keep you dry and warm. ""You get what you pay for"" as the old saying goes. There was another female customer upset by the much smaller womans department. It's not that the store is sexist as she complained. As a retailer myself I understand that means only that much of a percentage of the stores customers were female so the only dedicate just a little larger than that to the woman. But they will special order for the woman. Also woman if you want them to carry more, shop there more. Beyond clothes they had a nice hunting/fishing/camping section. I will be a regular customer when we finish moving up."
12154,Nice
12155,Get a Shrimp Quesadilla. It's not on the menu but it is Awesome.
12156,"2nd best pizza in Fairbanks,"
12157,Nice food.. go over there whenever you visit anchorage
12158,"Nice clean rooms, they have soft beds and pillows!"
12159,"It is more like a gaming store. Yes there are a lot of comics.  But more gaming and anima merchandise.  Also an area for table gaming.
I really enjoyed this store. The staff was friendly and very helpful."
12160,Good food
12161,"Great fried pickle spears and BBQ pork sliders. Can get crazy on game nights, but lots of TV screens for watching your teams play."
12162,"A cockroach crawled up my leg during dinner. Never going back.
#disgusting"
12163,Awesome food!
12164,"Great space and friendly space. Convertible as a convention center should be. Nice, open feel."
12165,"A must do on your trip! We didn‚Äôt expect much and were pleasantly surprised when we finally got the chance to stop in. The staff were very kind and helpful (just don‚Äôt ask for wifi).  We each tried a tasting flight of their brews. My favorites were the Crunk and Raspberry. I wish I could have taken those home! Although we didn‚Äôt order any food, the food I saw coming out looked wonderful. If I ever went back, I would insist on dinner."
12166,Best meat prices in town.
12167,They make my food how I like it
12168,Why did the tostada disappear from the menu? Hope a new tostada option is added soon. Taco bell Mexican pizzas are delicious.
12169,Burger and fries are good. Halibut chunks a little greasy and I didn't finish the clam chowder because it was sweet and tasted like they added too much butter and bacon.
12170,Great helpers!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
12171,"Food was ok, servise was decent."
12172,Good strains selection with deli style options
12173,They have good pizza the only problem it's too much grease
12174,Nice juicy steaks
12175,Nice hotel with food food.
12176,Glen had a part for a TV nobody else had in town.  Want great customer service go see him.
12177,"good pastries, nice atmosphere, my wife likes their coffee (i don't drink coffee)"
12178,Why is the drive thru so slow???
12179,Always so courteous and are willing to go above and beyond to make sure you get the part you need.
12180,Great customer service. Enjoyed visiting the store.
12181,Great poke!
12182,#JCPenny Always Awesome deal's there
12183,Ok
12184,"Of all the car washes in Anchorage, this place is the best hands down."
12185,Outstanding Super-Duper Service Great Menu Wonderful Experience Impressed Nice Comfortable Environment MAHALO
12186,Super friendly baristas and very patient as I was unfamiliar with the menu. Was a great experience.
12187,"I love Joann's, but I just moved to this area and was excited that there was even one here, but disappointed at the selection of items. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the selection of fabric is great, but everything else is just disappointing. I get a lot of home decor and crafting supplies from Joann's but this one just seems to fall short whenever I go in looking for something Joann's normally has"
12188,Best coffee hut in town
12189,"Wait staff was pushy with the gaming cards, then they lost our order (computer error supposedly).   After waiting over an hour they realized this.   To their credit the manager came and apologized and comped our meal.  Food then took another hour and one person's meal came out like another 15 mins after that.   Food was pretty bad.   Like Applebee's on a bad microwave day bad.   I really want to give them 2 stars since they comped the meal which was stand up, but even free it wasn't worth it.   If you want to play games I am sure it is great, but we never got to that point as dinner took so long."
12190,Dont drink here no fun but great place to have a good time
12191,"They have everything that you can expect a Costco they would carry some times more & some times less so if you need some thing special well you should buy it in Anchorage. Then travel But always be prepared like a boy scout carry way more than you think you could need
ALL I CAN SAY IS ALWAYS BE
PREPARED HERE OTHERWISE YOU MAY NOT HAVE A VERY GOOD TIME .
HAVE A GREAT SUMMER !!!!"
12192,"Waitress was one of the best I have seen load's of manners, very cheap for really good food"
12193,Very clean and friendly staff.
12194,I love this place
12195,Loved it
12196,"Good selection, helpful friendly staff.  If you are in Anchorage you definitely stop by."
12197,Beautiful
12198,I came in and the breads and treats looked super appetizing. I got a peach tea boba and it was also delicious.
12199,"For holiday  I used to get
Good tobacco cans there
They have also have good
Grab n go food ( snacks  )
Energy drinks , coffee , water n more"
12200,You can place your order for pickup and it's really quick doesn't always take two hours before it's ready.....and they are very friendly there.
12201,They had an S cord and it was reasonable
12202,"Two separate comments
1: for Liquid Adventure itself. 1/5. Really bad.  Lunch was bad. they said they will supply snacks which they didnt.
2: the guide. 5/5. he was nice. helped us with lot of lessons and photos. gave good rest and tips. at the end hot chocolate."
12203,Good food
12204,"Oh yes.  Best Mexican restaurant in town.  And the only one with Ramon, the most fun server EVER."
12205,guy fixed my mirror for free
12206,"Quality shop, that did a beyond job, highly recommend."
12207,Need more stores
12208,"For a small, ""Hole in the wall"" pizza place, this place makes one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Definitely in the top 5. Great crust, great sauce, great toppings (NO canned mushrooms, NO premade grey sausage),  and they deliver to Big Lake! They're gonna be seeing me a lot!"
12209,Had everything I needed & more!
12210,"A good night's rest. Not a run of the mill hotel. If you like eclectic as I do, you will enjoy this jem.
A towel rack and waste basket would have made this a strong 5 stars."
12211,Pretty good place to stay.
12212,"Very well laid out store, helpful staff, and decent prices üëç"
12213,Alittle more expensive than costco but still cheaper because of gas
12214,Amazing customer service and great food.
12215,It tasted great and they were friendly
12216,"Took 1 hour for food to be done, food was good tho. Service was excellent."
12217,Always delicious. The hamburger buns are made in house and help make these some of the best burgers in the Valley. The etouffee and shrimp and grits are favorites.
12218,All the fish/shellfish smelled and tasted old.
12219,"Fantastic place, people there are way awesome. The food is very, (like 3 verys) delicious. I'm going to continue to come and become a regular. Thank you firehouse.

P.s. I love where the money goes......"
12220,Good place to get local information center on nature and the Portage glacier.
12221,Good car wash
12222,"Oh man this place was nice and relaxing. The food and drinks were top notch. I ordered my usual Chai with oat milk and I had a raspberry cinnamon roll. Man, both were so good. I was able to find a table and I was glad they had the clean / dirty signs for the tables so customers knew if the table was clean or not. Just a fun place."
12223,Went to portage and walked the trail of blue ice.  Beautiful sunny day.
12224,"This Fred Meyer Fuel Center is my ""go-to"" gas station when driving between the valley and Anchorage.  The Glenn Highway is almost next door to the Fred Meyer Fuel Center, but not perfect.  The signal light is a pain and I feel like the left turn into the Fred Meyer Fuel Center isn't always clear.  Thankfully there are plenty of pumps and space to get around all vehicle types and sizes.  I didn't see restrooms, but that would be great feature in the future.

12225,My go-to grocery store
12226,Parking was wide open & flat. Pleasant place to be.
12227,Always great food
12228,Wonderful coffee and food!
12229,Been all over to most sushi restaurants and this one is totally worth the trip! $9 rolls!!
12230,I am very happy with the product I get here..
12231,Literally told the dude what I paid for my item and he goes and tells me they go for a hundred dollars less bran new  I still have the amazon ss of the price at 220$ and dude offered me 25. I will not be doing business with them in the future.
12232,Really good fresh made bagels and a great cup of coffee. A little expensive for a bagel sandwich but well worth it for fresh ingredients.
12233,"Clean affordable rooms, excellent, friendly staff, very quiet"
12234,Ok
12235,Nice train ride
12236,Cheaper there short distance

12239,"Bar, restaurant, movie theater, and event venue extraordinaire. The Blue Loon is an important part of Fairbanks entertainment opportunities. I love watching movies in real theater seats with wine and a snack. The live music, both local and imported, is top notch, the dance floor is large, and it's a safe place to go."
12240,"Good place to get a beer and some food, dont serve food every day of the week though."
12241,The guy working Sunday arround noon really helped me out and took care of my mistake. Sorry pal I don't remember your name but I remember the help.
12242,"Over priced, the ladies bathroom was absolutely dirty. My eggs over easy unfortunately were scorched on the outer edge making the edges and bottom hard and crunchy, and the flavor tasted like dish soap. The sasuage patties we're under cooked but just barely done.
The restaurant was very understaffed, we waited at the wait to be seated podium for 8 minutes, there were at least four couple's behind us who also had extended wait time. Food delivery was very slow, for simple meals, which gave us so hope of a quality meal. See above for those results.

Our waitress was very polite, but I did have to dump food particles from my chair, and the table I was able to clean several discoloration off with just a napkin.

Silverware, and straws were brought late, as we could not see our waitress went to the next table to aquire, sugar, and catsup.

Refill on tea we're prompt, and my friends egg olmet was very well done.

They do not offer a senior meal not offer 1/2 orders on even biscuits and gravy.

I find it interesting that a Denny's just a few blocks away closed, and yet this establishment is still open, but I doubt for long unless quality and customer service becomes Job 1. As well as keeping the bathroom clean, and the ladies was the worst of the two.

I find it interesting that over the years I have many times visited the bathroom first and left just because of dirty bathrooms, I did not do this and I feel it was mistake. I don't think I'm going back for a new review."
12243,RWs hambuger is the best in the valley

This world sometimes is too beautiful."

12266,Nice place to shop for bargains.
12267,"Everything you could need under one roof (including diamonds, if you are in that market). Their ‚ÄúSimple Truth‚Äù line of products is excellent and often the cheapest option as well. This is also a great store for the types of outdoor gear that all Alaskans need. Their organic section is great and they support local farmers as well. Alaskan grown carrots are about the crunchiest and sweetest you will ever bite into!"
12268,"Nice to be able to take my time have a coffee at Starbucks indoors., Then walk over and look at the periodicals for a while without being rushed. Almost business as usual!"

12312,"Went to Wal-Mart for fabric as I know the prices are less expensive than the fabric store in town. Wasn't surprised. Saved half of what I would have at the fabric store. The project I was doing I didn't need high priced fabric for it.  I needed hooks for hanging curtains which I found. Having company and needed mattress pad and king size blanket. Last I bought A vanilla candle, not to burn but to just smell good in the guest

12313,"Kind staff, nice mood, and good food!"

12331,"#1 R&R bar in Anchorage. Avoid loud and obnoxious crowd at neighborhing bars here most of the time. Unless it's a Friday or Saturday, in which case you're elbows deep in other patrons and find yourself listening to seemingly amusing yet only drunken ramble all night. still better than the alternative if you feel like you have to be out. Staff responds to politeness, make sure your sass is actually funny and not just rude/demanding. Steady service industry regulars. Good popcorn, new jukebox, now with bubbles and lots of Bob Marley"

12346,"WOW, we've been in a LOT of Cabela's stores in both Canada and the US and this is by far the best one we've ever shopped/stayed in (that includes the store right next to Corporate Headquarters in Sydney, NB).   We stayed overnight in their  RV service section next to the store. This includes a dump station but there is no potable water and a $5 fee for dumping.  There are large bays for extra large rigs and plenty of room around the outside for other units.   When we stayed we had the unfortunate luck to be there the same night that a guy decides to run his generator ALL NIGHT, but I guess this is what you get with free parking lot location stop overs.   We went into the store to say thank you and the staff were super friendly and I was happy to see, all aged over 11 years old, which is a first especially for our local Cabela's who seem to employ knowledgeable 11 year olds with a ridiculously high turn over of staff - hummm.   This Cabela's has restored my faith a little and will now give other stores another chance.  Thank you Cabela's for allowing RV's, we REALLy do appreciate it."

12350,Has mostly everything
12351,"Almost hidden away and separate from the other restaurants along the west end, it took us years since arriving in Anchorage to finally discover this place. I feel like it has something for just about everyone.

You want coffee and quick bit to eat? You got it. Sit down and casually eat? You got it. Lunch with friends or family? Definitely.

My wife and I went out for brunch and I certainly had trouble deciding on anything. Eventually chose the ""Hair of the Dog"" biscuits and gravy and it did not disappoint. Housemade beer biscuits were amazing and the whiskey reduction was a nice touch to already excellent sausage gravy. Local beers on tap alongside plenty of mimosa options... what's not to like? Wife enjoyed her vegetarian sandwich and quinoa a lot.

Service was a bit slow but all the employees were sincere, pleasant, and professional. I don't feel like it took away from the overall experience.

Decor is very unique... lots of oil paintings, rustic/steampunk, and graffiti. Felt very comfortable and clean.

We'll be bringing family though when they visit next time so they can try it for themselves."
12352,ordered with the app they never made my food until after i showed up took over an hour ended up late getting back for lunch
12353,Good wings and sandwiches but a bit pricey

12359,"The staff are always friendly, coffee is perfect and the breakfast burritos are delicious! üëç"

12361,Love how clean it is. Using a card instead of coins is great. Only issue number of machines.  Maybe a 3rd of the number at washboard.
12362,This is not so much a review for the North Pole Post office as it is the rural mail carriers.  I have lived in the same house for 7 years.  The mail box has been in the same place all those years.  Long story short while I was on vacation there was a notice placed in my box that they were no longer going to deliver my mail if I did not move my box 6 inches closer to the road.  In those last 7 years the only thing that has changed is 2 more boxes have been added to the end of the row and they do stick out 5-6 inches further than the rest. I was given 1 week to fix the problem.  Well when I got back from vacation 2 weeks later I had not received mail for al most 2 weeks.  The post office returned 2 packages that I sent myself from Europe.  I am well past pissed on the matter!!  I can not wait till I move into the new house off Chena Ridge and get rid of the horrible carrier that we have!!!!
12363,They are understanding and friendly.
12364,Pure isolated serenity. The coastline is unique to Alaska.

12454,"I have not been to the roof or the speakeasy. This review will only cover the ""concert hall/community room."" It's probably a lot better a space when you have a band play, but they have metal chairs and tables on concrete so the main room captures sound and makes it a little chaotic. Food is regular bar fair but seems a bit tastier than what you find else where in downtown Anchorage. It's not spectacular though. Service could use a little more training, BUT they are polite and are trying. If I was to make a comparison, I would say it's better than service at 49th State and the food is better priced too."
12455,"It's a walmart.  You'll get what you expect.  Sort of messy, sort of disorganized, like 1/10 of the registers are ever open.  Cheap and fast.  You get what you pay for here."

12463,"Friendly faces, good coffee, reasonable price. Their shop is a little out of my way but I stop in anyway."
12464,Very friendly place
12465,Had a great time
12466,Had some work done on my truck. Dealership took care of it quick.
12467,Great service!
12468,Excellent selection of items and customer service.
12469,"Best prime rib taco ever, love the selection of beers and sizes they offer."
12470,They treat you like family
12471,"Fair warning.  They do not tell you there are mushrooms in food.
When I asked them to change my dish cause I'm highly allergic. They just picked off the top mushrooms and left the rest.
Waiter was very kind. Kitchen staff needs help."
12472,My Vet took time to hear all my concerns about my cat and gave me my best options. I highly recommend.
12473,"The food is great, the drinks are great, the staff is amazing!"
12474,I help here alot
12475,"Love this place , it has great authentic mexican food. Must try ! Everything I've ordered so far has been amazingly delicious and the layout is pretty interesting as well"
12476,Quiet campground close to town. Plenty of large sites and no RV size restrictions
12477,"Great stay at a hotel. Probably one of the nicest ones I've stayed at in all of my work trips. Jacuzzi is great, very large room, big comfortable bed, and very clean. Only downside is that the tv wasnt working for cable. Any person staying in fairbanks should consider this hotel highly."
12478,Pet oriented feed store my boys love going there balto howls diggy does his squeak bark
12479,Awesome times!
12480,It's a good place to meet and have a few drinks. The prices are reasonable and service is what you expect in a bar. Plenty of seating and it's decent place to spend time relaxing with a cold drink.
12481,"Classic burgers, new favorites, awesome shakes"
12482,Great Bagel hamburger and ice cream!
12483,The food and the service is always top knotch!!!  My favourite is the Pancho Special!!!
12484,Never been there
12485,Best on the peninsula!
12486,"Amazing trails. Well kept, good chance of running into wildlife."
12487,Great little fair.
12488,My husband says they have the best chicken fried steak in town. I got an omelette that was a delight. Those home fries  are done right. I enjoy the atmosphere as well as the food--it's a proper greasy spoon place with large portion sizes. This includes their coffee mugs! Holey moley they gave me a big mug and I drank the whole thing. So while other places are booked Sunday morning this place was relatively quiet and we got a seat right away (I can't speak for the other days of the week).
12489,Good food a bit pricey
12490,"For the most part I do not do fast food after  7 p.m. because service is usually poor and food quality is not great. However, surprisingly, this visit was after 10 p.m. and I got hot fresh food. The best part was the service. Gracie had an excellent personality and was one of the nicest young ladies I've seen in fast food in a while."
12491,It was decent food but the prices seem higher after they were closed so long.
12492,Excellent
12493,Good service
12494,Love the chicken cheese sticks
12495,Always good food
12496,"Nice first time
Funny staff"
12497,Very nice park very clean bathrooms were dirty
12498,Everything that I want from my warehouse store experience.
12499,"Best Prime Rib that I've had in a long time. The service was great, even the manager stopped by at our table to check in on us and make sure we were happy with our meal. I will be back soon. They are finally building one in Riverview, Florida. A bit closer to home."
12500,So friendly and nice
12501,"Dirty and untidy restaurant, unfriendly service, long wait time for table, but the food was absolutely delicious when it finally arrived!"
12502,"This place is unique and it's a must see during your trip to Alaska. You must choose one of the official tour buses. It's the only way to see parts of the park you wouldn't see otherwise. We are planning to return there next time we are in Alaska. They have campgrounds and RV parks, but they need to be booked far in advance. Highly recommended."
12503,"A few of our selections in the photos, but are absolute favorite was the oysters, clams, and rib eye delicious üòã üòç"
12504,"Fantastic place to visit the outdoors, close to Anchorage. Very relaxing. Wonderful view."
12505,Nice hike
12506,Nice employees. But was cold in the restaurant
12507,Friendly but did not have japanese ingredients i was looking for.
12508,"Nice supply of equipment, plus the best supply of rain gear, in town. Also Tshirts, sweatshirt,. Souvenirs."
12509,Fun Crew!
12510,"A little touristy for me and it smells like chocolate (which, unfortunately, I don't like) but the staff is super friendly and everyone should stop by... Btw, there is an outlet store in the 5th avenue mall"
12511,Professional attitude.
12512,Very scenic drive.
12513,These guys have always treated me well.
12514,"Best place in town for a beer and live music, + camping right off the deck with a great view"
12515,Another great spot to take the kids on a sunny afternoon.
12516,Love this place! Great value and lots of supplies
12517,"Nice lodge, personnel efficient."
12518,Lot of stuff on sale for summertime
12519,This is the most clean and friendly laundromat I have ever to. Please use this place and tell your friends about it. Thanks
12520,Best buffalo burger in Delta Junction. The service is good to. We always try to stop here when passing through.
12521,Not a lot of options but the books are inexpensive!!
12522,Extremely knowledgeable staff. They know their products really well. They have their own shop and can service the vehicles and tools they sell.
12523,Great food
12524,Amazing food and fresh flowers at every table.
12525,Good coffee.good Service.
12526,"We have been going here of years but have noticed the food is lacking in taste and quality. Hope they get a handle on it, we used to love the place."
12527,"Incredible food, especially halibut, oysters, artisan cheese plate and pork belly!  Great local draught beers! Great service! A definite stop in Seward!"
12528,Good service good food
12529,Great food
12530,"In my opinion, these guys have always had the best wings, no matter what location in what state.  However, they only get 4 stars because of their outrageous Alaska prices and service that is not always on point.  Will never stop me from going though.  (Pro-tip: go for lunch, upgrade to the small boneless and get spicy garlic and asian zing.  Your tastebuds will thank you.)"
12531,A classy place with good hearty food. Had the Elk meatloaf and loved it.
12532,"The service is good, and their concessions are very good."
12533,"It's a wonderful place to be in, but sometimes it's hot cause probably the AC isn't working. Also, there are few people I've encountered falling asleep, cause the priest takes too long to give gospel.. maybe next time not so long.."
12534,Food was good but slightly different taste to the chicken and noodles... but overall I liked this place.
12535,Good prices and a clean store. Gas prices is on par with nearby stations nearby. Prefer this station over the Shell.
12536,Great little look out point and picnic area
12537,"I waited 10 minutes for someone to take my order, but no one did. Walked out"
12538,Delicious
12539,"Love love love the reclining chairs.  I will not see another movie anywhere else.  So comfortable,"
12540,We ordered their Chicken Katsu & Kalbi w/shrimp. I‚Äôve had better but it was delicious and had great customer service.
12541,Part and material is spot in. But dont go with a tattoo showing or find yourself with a secret shopper pushing a cart following you all though the store. I cant help but pick stuff up just to put it down rows from I get it. Lol
12542,"Reasonable prices, good food"
12543,Great food and great service
12544,"Took 1 hour for food to be done, food was good tho. Service was excellent."
12545,"Wonderful place. Comfy couches, very nice and roomy. Quiet privacy if alone or plenty room if its many. Excellent tea selection, coffee, herbal teas and goodies."
12546,Great people and a great place to eat. Food is excellent
12547,Alaska doesn't need a Dutch Bros with Boom here. You want some weird drink? They'll make it if it sounds good
12548,Great local place to eat! Friendly staff and excellent food.
12549,Makenzie was great!
12550,Nerd more activity
12551,The budtenders are super cool and very helpful. I love the welcoming atmosphere. Definitely one of my favorite dispensaries.
12552,Really good french fries
12553,"They don't serve real mashed potatoes or have baked. Ended up ordering FF.  Kinda skimpy on the porkchop &heavy on the ""beef "" gravy.   Unusual combination."
12554,"I have never had any problems with my order.  I've gone in and ordered as well as the drive thru many times over the years. They've all always provided fast and friendly service. I have no complaints.
I'm üíô it!"
12555,Fun and crowded..
12556,"(Translated by Google) We had a very noisy room facing the street, sleeping was out of the question

(Original)
Wir hatten ein sehr lautes Zimmer zur Stra√üe hinaus, an schlafen war nicht zu denken"
12557,Any day in the mountains is a good day
12558,Pefect
12559,Nice
12560,Delicious place! Try the bear claw!
12561,"Cheap wavey glass, careless technition(s), warrantees waved. Customers are not the only ones trying to save money."
12562,This would be five stars but it took forever to check out and the employee was speaking crazy talk like she just inhaled some paint.
12563,Delicious food! Don't miss the chowder! Great service!
12564,Really clean floors.
12565,"It's convenient and I like the selection of products. Can never walk past the cats up for adoption and anytime I bring little ones with me, they get a kick out of watching doggy daycare. Staff have always been helpful and polite on my visits."
12566,Fast
12567,very friendly service and busy. the portions are big.
12568,Finally had a torta after 6 years and it was almost unreal.
12569,Dropped of paperwork and as always the counter person was very helpful and courteous
12570,The staff at this location is awesome.
12571,Doesn't really carry alot of stuff that both family restaurants and family needs. Who doesn't carry the big can of spaghetti sauce.  And have you looked at the spice aisle.  Oh yea it really isn't a spice aisle.  Meat is highly priced. I  giving them a chance but Iat this point I will probably ask for my money back on my membership
12572,Fantastic!
12573,Great tubing hill
12574,Petco it is where the pets go
12575,Great breakfast spot a little South if Denali Park entrance. Cabin accommodations looked nice as well.
12576,Ok
12577,Wonderful experience!!!
12578,The people there are great.
12579,Fun
12580,"Great room for the price, most affordable place in town. And helpful and knowledgeable front desk staff."
12581,Go to Sweet Caribou for your macarons fix!!!
12582,"Went with the two little ones to look for cool rocks while the water is still low
Only a small group of boaters out tonight."
12583,Super nice staff
12584,The towels and sheets were stained.
12585,"I feel like I found the hidden secret place. So good! seating is very limited, but i always want to take it home.  While waiting they still give me water. Thanks!"

12587,one of my favorite fast food places always fast friendly service
12588,Great store!
12589,Outstanding
12590,Great views service and good. Last visit was for Mother's Day Brunch
12591,Awesome tool place
12592,"Hair Salon was fabulous, Thank you Joelle!"
12593,it's good food bit crowded of a dining area but it has a camp mess hall feel
12594,The agent was sooooo helpful!
12595,Good
12596,"Friendly, clean, loving, Best possible care"
12597,"Great ambience and amazing coffee. The slow brew methods employed by SteamDot, not to mention their choice bean selections, produce some of the most satisfying cups of coffee I've ever enjoyed. The midtown location is convenient and a great place to meet up with friends or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee while reading the newspaper."
12598,"Countetperson was tired and surely. All else was fine, though."
12599,"Not to many people, but there Juke box and sound system was great, you can play ping pong, pool, and pull tabs, and poker machine. Oh yah darts too. Food was delicious."
12600,Lots of places to enjoy.
12601,Always friendly and they sometimes have a line on the drive.  It‚Äôs faster to go inside.
12602,Good play area and skate park.
12603,Great burgers. I am especially fond of the Jalapeno Burger.
12604,Staff is friendly.   They dont usually offer what I need
12605,A cute little getaway on the South side of Anchorage
12606,Clean.
12607,Can hold cards to be delivered during holidays
12608,Came around lunch time.  Service was good and the sushi was on par with Anchorage.  Staff was attentive and food was brought out quickly.
12609,Shady
12610,Excellent customer service in a pressure cooker demanding environment.
12611,Food was excellent! Loved it
12612,Ok prices but wish produce was cheaper and a better quality.
12613,"Nice furnishings, horrible alcohol policy"
12614,"Dr. Boyd was amazing with my dog Nova. I came in with very vague description and general symptoms, but she was able to find a severe UTI and get the right treatment going. She even called me after to make sure I knew what to do and what other follow-up steps were need. I have recommended all my friends and family to switch! I am more than satisfied."
12615,My wife and I love this place! Great food and service!
12616,Beautiful spring day. Great service.
12617,About the best event in Alaska. First class all the way. I have been on it many times over the years.
12618,"My husband went in for ice cream. He spoke to them two people working there about getting service.  They both walked away.  I can't say if the food is good because we didn't get any food, just a cold shoulder."
12619,It's beautiful. I just can't deal with all the people.
12620,Great for coffee
12621,"This is the best game store. They have a bit of everything and the best customer service you can imagine and then some. ‚ù§ Thanks guys, y'all are the best."
12622,it's a chain that should be consistent and decent but I was very disappointed. service was terribly slow and it did not appear to be busy in the restaurant. when we did get our food it was inconsistent at best and just not worth eating in some items. can't say I'll be back.
12623,"If you're gift shopping I highly suggest looking around, they have a little of everything and tons of cute stuff. Lots of helpful employees, amazing service, except the blonde lady with braided hair who swore at us for not making eye contact(in our culture unnecessary or excessive eye contact is considered rude). But this place is a cute little wonderland shop hiding in the corner of anchorage, worth trying out at least once. Got this cute magnet motion butterfly for the car's armrest"
12624,Amazingly helpful staff willing to help even if they don't currently have what you are looking for either by ordering it out referring you to somewhere that may have it. Will even come out and look at your car with you to help you make important choices.
12625,The best Mexican food & AWESOME service...!!!
12626,Cozy restaurant with friendly staff and delicious menu. Would recommend stopping in at least once.
12627,Service was slow and forgetful. Food was ok and forgettable.
12628,We go here to buy a lot of stuff. Same friendly staff the last 20 years. Great prices.
12629,"Best buds, best service"
12630,"Very interesting history of this artist and the rugged beginnings in the Alaska forest above Homer.  The paintings and other pieces of art were lovely,  but very expensive."
12631,"Old established hotel in Anchorage with lots of history.  However,  it is dated to include entry doors of heavy wood that are difficult to open.  There is a doorman on the main entrance on 4th Avenue, but the 5th Avenue entrance has none. The sidewalk on the 5th side also needs work as it is uneven and has a steep slope.  Also, the physical fitness areas are entirely separated for men and women with different entrances and only a limited area for couples to work out together after gaining entrance.  While the place recently replaced the old,  loud, and uneven flooring on the first floor and new furniture is expected soon, there are a few more things needed here to bring up the rating at this hotel."
12632,Went here thinking their prices may be better or at least competitive. Instead was way higher and told by manager petsmart does NOT price match unless you TAKE A PICTURE OF SAME ITEM FROM ANOTHER STORE AND SHOW THEM. Accorsing to the so called manager they don't have the knowledge or capacity to look up a competitor's  Ireland price . don't waste your gas or patience as I did! I'll keep my business at petco. If i could do NO STARS I would.
12633,The best Gluten Free pastries in the entire state!
12634,Knowledgeable fun easy going staff always makes you feel welcome. Will never buy my jewellery anywhere else.
12635,Great store
12636,I to my dog cowboy to the vet on Ft. wainwright and they determined that he had a significant tumor on his spleen that needed removed as soon as possible. I gave multiple vets a call to see when they could get me in and they all gave m the run around. I called Aurora Animal Clinic and they were extremely helpful over the phone. Any questions I asked that the receptionist did not know asked the Vet after we got off and called m back. They were able to adjust their schedule enough to get cowboy in that day. Dr. Pestch (spelling) did an amazing job and cowboy was back to normal within a few days. The entire team was amazing. This place is the best Animal clinic I have been to (12 clinics in 4 states).
12637,Needs to have the footprints through the store showing how to find the bathrooms for visitors.  Needs better lighting as well
12638,not much choice in gas companies.
12639,Excellent healthy food options and espresso. Their desserts are out of the world.
12640,Fun
12641,"Ordered vegetable tempura, the sweet potato was rancid. Not going bad, or a little off - rancid, brown, smelly and mushy and I didn't know until I ate some because of the breading. Person I went with had sushi they said was good but my experience was really awful."
12642,Really depends whos working
12643,Country Liquor has the best microbrew selection I've seen on the entire Kenai Peninsula. The staff is also very helpful at providing recommendations on beers and wines.
12644,Love this German bar and the local music
12645,Needs more stores :-(
12646,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!
12647,Great view of the Turnagain areas year round.
12648,I'm a big fan! üòÑ
12649,"Good food, good service, good ambience."
12650,Super duper amazing place! Bucket list placement: high!
12651,"I love the Nail Bar! Clean, very friendly staff, courteous of your time, and they give mini massages during their manis and pedis too!!"
12652,"Great food, fast service, awesome servers!"
12653,Denali mac was awsome and filling.
12654,"prices here are sometimes hefty amd three quality isn't always the greatest, but it's a good selection of craft supplies."
12655,Since bass pro took over this store has gone way down hill particularly the ammo selection which pretty much doesn‚Äôt exist here anymore
12656,Always tasty!
12657,Very tranquil place to relax.
12658,Good coffee
12659,Great ice cream and quick service
12660,"This place is unusual, but really good. There's a wheelchair ramp, but the screen door opens the wrong way, so the ramp is not a usable entrance into the building. You can make reservations, but the chef cooks one dish at a time-- so you get one dish out at a time. The waitress is the chef's daughter, and she's very straightforward and a little scattered. When you walk in, she's immediately worried about your experience. She tells you, ""Let me tell you how this restaurant works. The hand-written menu is on the walls. Don't ask me what you should order because I don't know your tastes."" Then, she tells you about the homemade sesame spinach and homemade gyoza. Get both of these items. The spinach is cold, and I was really regretting my decision to order the spinach... until I tried it. Seriously-- it's the most delicious vegetable I have ever eaten in my life. The homemade gyoza was amazing-- I think the chef's wife makes it. Anyway-- it didn't even need sauce. It was delivered hot and crispy right to our table. Our table had the chirashi zushi and two bowls of ramen. Everything was delicious, and we were assured it was quite authentic several times by our Japanese grandmother. The broth for the ramen was out of this world. I could have eaten just the broth and been happy. The food is very, very good, and even though the way the restaurant works is vastly different from your typical restaurant, it's totally worth trying out. It feels a lot like you are walking into someone's home for dinner. Cash and cards are accepted-- our waitress had no trouble with the card. The chef's wife came and spoke in Japanese grandmother while we waited for our food to be served. This place works best for groups of 2-3, but they can do big groups of maybe up to 12-14, as long as you are patient and do not expect your food to come out all at the same time. The sesame spinach is a must-try, and the ramen bowls are huge.

This entrees are $16-$40 each, depending on what you get. The appetizers are $7-10. Green tea is a $1/cup, and was very fresh and tasty. They have a limited beer and sake selection-- we did not partake, but they had sapporo and I don't remember what their sake selection included.

We will definitely be back. There are a bunch of things on the menu that we still want to try.

I can see where some of the negative reviews might have come from-- we weren't really sure what to expect when we walked in. We knew it was a Japanese restaurant, and the waitress seemed a little like she expected us to decide to leave instead of staying once we saw the menus on the walls. If you're expecting Benihana-levels of service, you'll be disappointed... but if you expect the service you'd get from going to a friend's house for dinner, you will be quite happy here."
12661,"Discount Costco with not even half of the selection, product is bought from what looks like Costco, then marked up in price"
12662,Neat little info center- just the parking lot view alone is worth the short drive back
12663,"It's a decent place, but the Fat Guy has to be the rudest SOB I've ever dealt with.  I would give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the Fat Guy.  Otherwise, the other staff members were always professional and friendly."
12664,"love the hot Springs, prepare to be surrounded by tourists"
12665,Beautiful.
12666,Better than ACS but the speed and connection is trash when playing a lot of online games.
12667,I'm a bit surprised that this place isn't under best pho in town. I didn't know what pho was until visiting here. A nice lady at another restaurant referred me to this particular restaurant. I was greated with a warm welcome and all my questions were answered in a respectful way. I was told how to eat and use the spices and sauces on the table. This is now a favorite for my girlfriend and I. We're definitely going to be visiting again and thanks for a fantastic experience.
12668,It's just like any other Walmart but smaller.
12669,Good sushi/Japanese food. Service is good. Great lunch specials. Lighting is on the dark side but atmosphere is fine.
12670,I love the harbor!!
12671,"Great sales, up to 75% off remnants.  Not bad!"
12672,"Lobster bisque, garlic mashed potatoes, and blue cheese stuffed meatloaf; A wonderful way to enjoy a rainy, fall afternoon. This $20.00 meal won't break the bank and was more than I could finish."
12673,Their prices are fair there awesome people that work at knik salvage
12674,"Sandwiches beyond reproach.  Like a sandwich shop from the 80's, wonderful service and bread positively overflowing with meat and cheese!"
12675,THE BEST PLACE BUT NEED FREE VACUUMING!
12676,Amazing
12677,"The staff are super nice, coffee and donuts are amazing! Have not had donuts so yummy since the Donut Hut in palmer when I was a little kid."
12678,"Much improved since I was there last year. Quit going because I couldn't hear anyone talking. Now not so extremely loud. Audio boxes are tableside for listening to any games on the TVs. Food was good. What I expected. I'm personally on a restricted medical diet, and found plenty of good options. Service even also improved, but it was never an issue for me anyway. Just nice to see. May be better off with a bit smaller menu, and changing it up some seasonally. Not uncommon, probably just a thing for me."
12679,Makes AutoZone look like they don't have inventory. My gripe is I bought an alternator and they can't find the records and I can't find the invoice which is odd I keep all my reciepts. But since theyvcant find it no warrantee for me. I bought better than OE on my 2000 F150. 5.4L there is nothing they can do. It's the only time they didn't cone thru for me frustrating yes cost them a sale yes. But I will still use them as my primary vehicle 0arts and accessory store. Peace
12680,They have a good selection of decorations and specialty houseware items. Really had to sum up what the place is with a single descriptor. Semi-functional home decor works best I think. They definitely have a selection of stuff that nobody else has. Scented candles are even a bit different to smell through...
12681,Very nice good food and exhibits
12682,Friendly Crew
12683,good food but a little pricey for the portion
12684,"Great burgers, long waits but worth it. Wish they would do fries the way they used to."
12685,Just had a takeout salad.  It was very good.
12686,"The server, Amanda, was amazing and friendly. Always checked on us."
12687,"Love their $5 and $6 lunch deals.  A burger or chicken sandwich, fries, a drink AND even a Sunday. Can't be beaten. It may sound too good to be true, but it IS true!"
12688,Liquid vapor is the only thing that they will carry I went in to see if I could get a dry earb vapor it is not possible I asked him if they would be getting them in they said that was not possible and no way we're not going to get them in in my opinion if you want to start a Vapor shop and you're only going to go half way then you're not going to be a very good Vapor Shop after telling me that there would be no way that they was going to go to do dry Vapor I made it a point to never ever darken that door again
12689,"Best car wash in wasilla, guaranteed. They pre-rinse and hand scrub before sending you through the machine. Be sure to tip, they deserve it!"
12690,"The workers we're very polite and the rooms where wonderful. I love the deck that they have and it was all around a great experience
!"
12691,"Ice skating, Best Buy, Olive Garden & Pretzels...that's a good day!"
12692,The park itself is old and could use some updating. But my kids still had fun.
12693,Good service and food. Easy to get to from the highway
12694,Great beer.... The pretzel is wonderful. One of the best patios in Anchorage in the summer.
12695,easy access hot and ready food quick service
12696,"Tasty and very hot coming out. Portions are interesting, seems that drinks are skimped but food is piled high. The Thai tea was primarily ice and not for cooling.
I have no complaints about the food or service. The place is immaculate, just was something odd that stuck out to me.
Outside of that I'd say it's a good place, just not notably so. Need to do something to capture the repeat customers. If I didn't have this place saved, I'd probably have forgotten it."
12697,"This place is big and good. I found everything and anything I wanted . It was lost of working people on flor I was able to ask questions. If I needed help I got some one to answer.
I definitely will be back here when I pass by.
Did I say is very clean and very well organized! Yes yes yes"
12698,"We had the eggrolls, mee krob, & panang beef curry. Everything was excellent."
12699,Not much cleaned place.
12700,"Fishing, picnicking, chalet for events."
12701,The best Barber in town! Very friendly and interesting.
12702,"Food was pretty good, good portions nice homey atmosphere"
12703,"Food was okay, not memorable in my opinion. The server was not available as often as we had hoped, it looked like he had too many tables to take care of. All in all it would have been nicer if we had more attentive service."
12704,Very calming place to sit and have tea and bakery items. They have so many varieties of dried teas to purchase. It makes blending your own easy.
12705,They gave me helpful and relevant information. The customer service is relaxing and above reproach.
12706,"Awesome menu, plenty of beer, modern atmosphere. Decent prices as well."
12707,"Great playground, fields, and multi-purpose cabanas."
12708,"Daughters and I loved this hotel, the views were great - even though initially I was sad that all the harbor-side rooms were sold out we were amazed with the mountain-side room's view - it was jaw dropping beautiful with a waterfall cascading down the green mountain.  Indoor pool, was the main reason we chose this hotel and it was great with a nice hot tub on the side. Overall extremely pleased with the hotel and the service - everyone was very nice.  A few very minor downsides that dropped it to 4 stars instead of 5 were: pool towels were tiny and not plentiful and usually had to ask them to restock and even then only a small amount was brought out so as soon as another family arrived - they were out of towels instantly.  Also the breakfast buffet they served ran out of bacon and scrambled eggs only 30 minutes after breakfast started which was a 2 hour long breakfast period (luckily I got 2 strips of bacon - but my kids were out of luck) and when I asked the worker if they were going to bring more bacon she said unfortunately they didn't have any more thawed out because the night girl forgot to thaw the breakfast food. Then their pancake maker malfunctioned a few times but eventually the lady was able to get batter changed properly and the kids had pancakes - which were very good."
12709,Always have a good experience here. I'm in and out with a trailer I need every time without fail. Keep up the good work.
12710,I was on the receiving end of a purchase.  I sold my motorcycle to someone who financed a bike.  They just gave me the check didnt communicate with me sent me on my way.  I realized that i didnt have a bill of sale went back and the little man at the counter was no help.  I finally made the guy get the bottom of the title so that i could report the motorcycle was being sold to the dmv.   The little man at the counter didn't have a problem interrupting my meeting when i met with the banker to receive my check however he had an issue interrupting the fat banker who had me sign my title away.  They said they do not do bill of sale for these kinds of purchases and wouldn't accommodate me as the seller.
12711,Love their shrimp tacos
12712,Awesome
12713,"Very good, the shows are awesome, the villages and artifacts are very interesting. There are some folks selling handmade local items. Worth a visit"
12714,Not a place to shop if you wear woman's size above 10.
12715,"Had too wait for over 10 minutes. No one in restaurant, all tables were dirty and needed to be bused. Finally got to sit and had a very good water."
12716,Yum
12717,Place sucks!
12718,Staff was very friendly and knew what they were talking about. It was a very chill environment.
12719,Good trip
12720,"Open 24hrs, uses quarters, lots of bays."
12721,Awesome food!
12722,"Very nice, make sure to take a cruise as well"
12723,Great Italian food!!
12724,"We don't like the menu changes, they took out what we liked.
The people working there where very nice and did a great job"
12725,"Had an awful squeal in my car, was concerned the wheel was going to fall off! I took it by expecting to have to leave it for days. They identified it by sound that a smallish rock had lodged in the brake rotor, and pulled it in minutes and cheerfully assured me that I could swing by anytime to get that fixed if it happened again. Really cool guys, they have my business for life!"
12726,Was at Fletcher's. Bartender was attentive.
12727,Awesome place.  They have it all.
12728,Cool store with some locally made pieces.
12729,Great deals going on right now üòä
12730,Okay
12731,"Fast, friendly, my favorite Taco Bell Location."
12732,"Yes. This is the place -- with, frankly, some of the very best wings we've eaten in Alaska (or anywhere else). Especially on a wintry day, a perfectly respectable hot pizza, a good sandwich and fries, and a shared plate of wings ought to warm you right up. We love the lodge-inspired look of the place. Tip: try to snag that seat near -- but not right in front of -- the fireplace!"
12733,"Burgers nasty, best contracts for kids stuff"
12734,Good food
12735,"One of our favorite coffee shops in town. Lots of odd, out of this world knick knacks."
12736,"Friendly service, good food, and a relaxed atmosphere. Great place to eat."
12737,"Great subs, awesome price. A must stop."
12738,"To much food, not bad"
12739,All kids love this park! It's the heart of Eagle River for families üíú
12740,"It's an okay bar, the drinks are too expensive though. They have good popcorn & pizza for good prices."
12741,"(Translated by Google) Great burger and nice service! Always worth a visit! Very good location and very nicely decorated. Everything was fine and the gold burger of my fianc√©e was a real eye-catcher :)

Super Burger und nette Bedienung! Immer ein Besuch wert! Sehr gute Lage und auch sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet. Alles war bestens und der Gold Burger meiner Verlobten war ein richtiger Blickfang!:)"
12742,"Foods ok, just don't order salad too much dressing and not anything special."
12743,Nice quiet atmosphere with prompt service and really good food.
12744,Excellent experience! I would recommend anyone interested give it a try.
12745,Great pictures and news articles from the quake of 1964. Slightly cheesy movie supposed to look like a 60's documentary features footage from quake aftermath-- and the seats rock to show the force of the quake.
12746,Open mic every Sunday night  8-12
12747,Love the drive up pharmacy. Its amazing how much stuff they pack into these little places.
12748,Great place to unleash your inner nerd.
12749,Hands down best BBQ in AK!!  Can't wait for them to get back up here this seaon... new location we have heard.
12750,Go here. Very neat. Would visit again.
12751,Beautiful
12752,Bought a motorhome and the sales department was fantastic. Very patient and informative.
12753,"The carne asada sirloin tacos were tasty, not soggy. I like the Salsa Bar a Lot. No beer. They're still trying to obtain a beer & wine license. Service was friendly and attentive. My first time. I will go back."
12754,The best!!!
12755,Great for pokemon. Has two pokestops right next to each other.
12756,Great place to go as a family
12757,Convenient
12758,Awesome üëç üëç. Good place for smelly goodness
12759,Helpful service. Great sale going on. Complete inventory.
12760,"They get the orders right 95% of the time (as they are only human). If you have a question about the the restaurant or food, they will always be happy to let you know their answer. They provide Braille and picture menus as well as free Wi-Fi. Sometimes takes a few minutes to get food but usually no longer than 5 minutes."
12761,Intimate atmosphere. Great food
12762,I love Chinese food...
12763,"Freindly bartenders, karaoke"
12764,"The rooms are great and the beds are comfy. If you order food in the restaurant it can be a challenge.

The bacon was horrible, pancakes over cooked, has browns were cold and the service.. ..I don't have enough room here.

I don't know if I would stay here again. For the money they charge, everything should be perfect! Save the grief and go somewhere else to eat."
12765,Good place to live.
12766,"In every way, this is easily one of the nicest restaurants in Anchorage. The space is gorgeous with a full bar with higher end cocktails you won't find anywhere else. Service unparalleled, by all staff I've encountered. With taco Tuesday (1/2 off tacos), this is the perfect place for date night or a weekly watering hole stop."
12767,Thanks for having milkshakes on a hot day.
12768,Great FLGS. When I moved up here I was worried that it would be hard to find a great game store but I was proven wrong by Bosco's. They are everything I want in a game store and there is always someone on staff who has a personal knowledge on whatever you are looking for.
12769,"Fast, friendly and affordable service."
12770,"Barbie's Cafe is one of those hidden gems that often are skipped over in favor of franchise restaurants. Don't pass them up! The food is excellent, the portions are generous, and the staff are friendly."
12771,Great stop if you need anything tech related
12772,Best bar in Ketchikan!!
12773,Incredible local business. At the upper tier of quality for Alaskan micro breweries. I give it the highest rating possible!!!
12774,Friendly and clean.
12775,Great food and friendly staff
12776,Wholesale outlet. Prices are MUCH better than the big stores due to selling close-dated items.  Example: Need coffee? Peet's Coffee at 50% off the Fred Meyer regular price! And the best part: Alaskan-owned small business!!
12777,"Must go place if you have kids. Our guide was good and had fun feeding all the reindeer. Me and My kids went all crazy with the furry reindeer. My kids went crazy for the little cat Leo that was wandering in the farm. They give a good sight of how they manage this big group of animals and how they interact with them. Moose , Bison , yak was fun too.. it‚Äôs a good place to visit if you are in Anchorage."
12778,OMG BEST DOUNT PLACE IN AK ever
12779,Our family loves this place! Excellent food and service!!
12780,The Pad Thai is Amazing!!!  I also love their pot-stickers and all the types of curry. The staff is very friendly and welcoming.
12781,"Great on service. Quality has declined in the past several years regarding food. Hope they will improve that, as are a nice local restaurant. Nice outdoor seating in summer."
12782,"Fritz Creek-EXCELLENT FOOD!!! Eggplant sandwich was amazing. Be prepared to be micro-managed. Kind of scary; the store is being managed through fear. The experience was overwhelming and not customer friendly. I understand the economic crisis and social distancing stress. The way it was handled could have been much better. Please consider kindness. I would consider saying where to stand rather than where NOT to stand. Hard to navigate.  üôÇAgain, food excellent."
12783,"Best place to get smokes for a great price, friendly staff"
12784,Great play tonight
12785,These guys are TERRIBLE!  AT&T has gone downhill big time.  This location is one of the worst.  Absolutely the worst customer service.  Management needs to fire all the clowns working here!  Get it together!
12786,Always the best food and services ‚ù§
12787,"Great little place in Bethel. There's a library and there are occasional events and things going on, like the Saturday market."

12793,Halibut burger is the way to go. Really really good! Good chowder.
12794,They are great people to do business with.
12795,"This is an RV park, but a campground.  There aren't shaded sites, but it's got nice grass, showers and a laundry facility.  I didn't have an issue leveling my trailer, and the full hookups were nice.  The view is nice, but not great.  It's a little off the main road, but it's nice."
12796,Popular area .. great for everyone.. have BBQ  area with picnic tables under covered roof .. walking trails..dog walking .. They do need to put in bathroom facility .. or portable ones . Good for pictures of Creek and sunsets .. nice large parking lot area..
12797,So good! That is all.
12798,"Ok, so they have a monopoly on the gift shop market here, but where else can you buy stickers, Alaska shaped hunks of very thick metal, -40 degree overalls, boots and snacks and also mail a letter? All right, it's Alaska, so perhaps there are other places you can, but if you made the trip to Prudhoe Bay, stop here! Oh, don't forget to ""Remove Spiked Foot Wear, Thank You""."
12799,Usual + honeyfromHawaii
12800,Really good pizza!!!!
12801,"Christine was knowledgeable, professional, and didn't prod me into a more expensive mattress. I had a price range and she showed me options--- insisted I actually lie on  the bed to test it in the positions I sleep. With a pillow. She answered my questions clearly, explaining sometimes in different ways so I understood better. Who knew buying a ""bed"" was more than just a mattress. She made it easy. I had already been to other places. So, I could compare. Finally the store is clean, nicely lighted. No dust bunnies or bits  of paper scattered about on the floor. And it smelled clean. Not cloroxy clean or flowery or warehouse-y. Just fresh. Masks were worn by all. Sanitized pens were provided. And, we kept a nice social distaI highly recommend Ultimate Mattress Store. Delivery and assembly are available as well."
12802,Had an Excellent meal here.. this place is great... The staff is friendly and our server was attentive to when we were close to needing refills a d table cleared.. Their Buffet service is bar far well worth the 5 Stars and I purchased 2 meals to go for my mother ... Great job
12803,"nature, wonderful place"
12804,Awesome pancakes
12805,"As always, the staff were caring and helpful. I have a knee injury and they were patient wirh my clunky slow self. They made sure i had a seat while checking out. I didnt feel pressured or rushed. I already know the next amazing piece i will be buying."
12806,"SOOOO GOOD! Seriously, finger licking good.  The tea is amazing, injera is tangy, and the curries and stewed vegetables are very tasty. Lots of good vegetarian options too! Do yourself a FAVOR! Eat here!"
12807,Horrible service and nothing gets done right not to mention how they tteat employees

12812,Great little farmers market on Wednesday and Saturdays during summer.  They have lots of great cupcakes and lots of other delicious treats
12813,Average place.
12814,"Zero dollars for the appointment, was actually hundreds of dollars, since, apparently, Premera knows what testing I need more than my Doctor does."
12815,Very helpful well-informed staff. Great place to buy a quality mattress! üëç
12816,Very limited menu. Drinks are expensive.

12820,Someone told me this is EDEN GARDEN
12821,"The lodge is large and of course invites tourist from cruise ships and so can get crowded. But still this place is beautiful. It imitates the beauty of the expansive scenery. Clean, comfortable with restaurants on site [ expensive ], laundry and bike rentals."
12822,"Really good pizza, excellent prices, love the ready and hot pickup!"
12823,"Really disappointed, service was slow even with few guests. Ordered a chicken avocado sandwich on bruschetta, got it on hamburger bun and the chicken was watered down, with no taste other than water.  Fries were good though."
12824,"Best Thai food in town and there are a lot of choices! Excellent Curry, cozy atmosphere."
12825,Clean and nice üëå

12829,Went there once while doing the Miner's & Trapper's ball and ordered 3 pizzas.   Was charged $20 for each pizza and they had such small chopped and little toppings they were just plain pizzas to me.   That and they were a foot from one side to the other.   Very much over priced.   I chose to never go back.
12830,The view is incredible and the atmosphere is 1st class. The food and service is always great too
12831,"Food always cold,  the people who work there are more interested in conversing with each other than taking your order or prepping your food while it's still hot!! Don't go!!"
12832,Hours are great for the late night munches
12833,The mushing school was an Unbelievably wonderful experience! !! Will do again!!

12857,Food
12858,"Its fast, convenient for grabbing a q1uick snack plus it has all your car fluids needed.. Pay outside with credit card 24hrs a day... And definitely worth the stop if you carry a Fred Meyer shopping cart"
12859,I like their cell phone services.
12860,It is expensive and not much stuff to choose from
12861,"Now that they expanded the space within the store, it makes it look extremely empty. Or maybe they actually are running low on merchandise. Either way, store looks very empty."
12862,Good food just expensive for what you get.
12863,"Good service unless your in the middle of nowhere like Astoria, Oregon"
12864,"Unlike many Taco Bell's I've been to, they often don't mess up your order. It's happened a couple times but their staff is always friendly and willing to help."
12865,"I picked this auto shop because of the high review ratings.. they replaced my alternator on my Subaru. After reviewing the work they had done and the bill I received I realize they charged me $270 for an alternator I could have picked up on my own for a hundred bucks. Having said that my real complaint is the fact that my belts were not tightened fully and give off horrible squeals anytime my car set at idle or when I turn my lights on. Today I went out and bought a socket set and fix the problem myself. While I believe in second chances, I feel the case in Auto Repair it should be right the first time. I later went to someone I know and found a place that would have done it for less money and had it done correctly the first time. Live and learn"
12866,Bought a great pair of running shoes from this place with the help of their friendly employees
12867,Very nice and clean. Had a wonderful time on the bike trails. I will be going back soon.
12868,They always provide a great meal and experience. Never disappointed!

12871,"Good food, the service was great and I really enjoyed the environment, solid 10/10"
12872,"Last two times I ordered here I specifically asked for fresh breadsticks and pizza , even Offered to pay more money to make sure I would get fresh food. Long story short , I got home and the pizza had came out of the warmer and then ran through the oven to warm it a bit and the breadsticks were also not fresh, half were hard and the other half chewy. Haven‚Äôt ate there since."
12873,What a great place to spend an afternoon. They offer some great classes too.
12874,Yummy
12875,"Always nice atmosphere, super friendly staff. Great beers! Food to compliment the brews. All good!"

12881,Hands down the BEST Sushi and Chinese style dinner in town!
12882,"Great park. Glad I made it. The tours seem to go from bathroom to bathroom but the scenery in between was beautiful -we saw Moose, wolverine, deer, rabbits & more. . The clouds cleared and witnessed the mountain."
12883,Best tasting cup of Vanilla Latte in Anchorage. Really cute barista also
12884,Food was ok but not exciting.  Service and view of harbor were good.
12885,Really only good for magic games/tournaments. They have some board games and a little memorabilia but reminds me more of a single person selling off their collection that a gaming genre store
12886,Service department is great!
12887,I went here when I was a little kid. I took my wife and son today and had a excellent time. Beautiful grounds and animals. Added quite a few things since I was there about 15 years ago.

Nice view of the water though..."
12913,"This resort is SO amazing and SO beautiful! I visited this hotel for the first time last winter. I had a small baby so, we didn't ski. We took the tram to the top of the mountain and it was SO NICE!"
12914,Make sure you call first for reservations. Parking lot in back has more room than the one in front.  Kobe specials #1 and #2 are highly recommended.  Don't forget to tell them if it's a birthday or anniversary celebration.

12944,"First dining experience on their second day open and EVERYTHING was top notch! The halibut and chips are some of if not the best in town, and I'm picky about my halibut and chips. The salmon was excellent as well. The garlic butter on top really compliments it. What really elevates this place, is its very rustic, Alaskan feel. You can tell they put alot of thought and care into the design and feel of this place. But the icing on top is, they have their own beer! These guys are coming out swinging and I for one am thoroughly impressed. Will be back several times!
Cheers! üçª"
12945,Delicious food at great prices! Wide selection to choose from and friendly staff!

Would use agin"
12949,"Loved it! I usually doordash an order for breakfast but I was next door today and decided to stop in. I had the sourdough BLT and it was SO good. I also had the Alaska Chai latte, which is my new favorite. It's a nice little place, super cozy, the staff is awesome. I'll definitely be back, and will continue to doordash orders."

12956,"staff argues with you when they get your order wrong, yet they won't read the receipt."
12957,"We stopped in after seeing all the commercials for El Rodeo. Strong margaritas, authentic entrees, and delicious desserts! Great service from the entire team and super accommodating to dietary exceptionalities. They also accept any local Mexican restaurants coupons. We will be back."
12958,It was my first time coming to this hair salon and I was greeted warmly by the owner's daughter. The mom was super friendly and the daughter as well. I got exactly what I wanted. They made me feel like they've known me forever. Best place in town.
12959,The lady at the desk is very friendly and answers all questions that you may have

12961,Everything about the drinks are fine but whoever chooses the music should keep in mind that no one in there right mind wants to listen to the Stranger Things theme song and trashy heavy metal versions of  pop songs. Not sure if this is a usual thing but I wouldn't care to come back to this specific Starbucks
12962,"Awesome people, nice campground. Go play Epic with the guides if you have a chance!"
12963,Definatly a great hike!
12964,Ok place where locals go to briefly chill after work for an on-the-way-home reprieve to stare at a lake.  LOTS of MOSQUITOES (JUNE).
12965,They really need to staff more cashier's.

12973,Price
12974,"Everything you would expect from a base gas station. Clean, cheap, and quality stuff"
12975,"It was open and the food hasn't made me sick. That's about all I can say for it. Our waitress couldn't answer even simple questions about the menu, and made everything sound bad. Well, maybe she was just being honest. She was shocked when we asked for ketchup for fries, handed us a bottle with about a teaspoon in it and drifted away. It took another 10 min to flag down someone who could provide some, by which time the originally lukewarm fries were solidly cold. My cheeseburger arrived without cheese, and was underwhelming in several other ways. The food (burgers and fries, nothing complicated) took a long time to arrive and was overcooked and bland. I would recommend trying anywhere else."
12976,A very popular shopping center in downtown kenai
12977,"I'm giving one star because on their monitors they advertise a promo. But when I asked for that deal, I was told that that prompted wasnt good since November. I guess I'm petty"

12986,Do not know much but this is where I visited their. Food bank 10:00 -1:00 M-F
12987,Friendly staff and decent prices..
12988,Like the red chicken curry
12989,I won't shop at any of the Anchorage Walmarts unfortunately due to the lack of security and carelessness of the employees. Too much crime in the area. Eagle River Walmart is much better!
12990,Awesome everything
12991,The water was FREEZING cold... bbbrrrrr
12992,Wonderful!   Badly need a store like this in Kona!
12993,It's a gas station and store. Seems prices are good.
12994,Thanks
12995,"Lena was awesome, thank you! Great pizza by the slice lunch special, will be back"
12996,Monthly coupons you get in your mail are worth keeping and using.  Food quality is consistent and workers are friendly inside and at the drive through.  Possibly the quickest drive through service in Anchorage.
12997,Great price and selection
12998,Great vape juice
12999,Great food and clean place!

13002,Typical wallmart
13003,Great Vape store
13004,"The bread sticks are one of the best reasons to come here. The garlic bread is pretty good too.

The Prime Rib isn't bad,  but the seasoning isn't memorable.

The meat ravioli came from a bag. I was expecting hand made. I'm not sure where I got that idea.

This restaurant is alright. Like most Soldotna restaurants, it's not extraordinary, but it's not bad either."
13005,Great place

13015,Its taco bell
13016,"Have never had bad food or poor service. Small town ""diner"" feel to it. We get the breakfast buffet most frequently. Competitively priced.

The decor and layout is the reason for the reduction in stars. I have no clue what this building use to be, but it doesn't appear to be a restaurant, very mixed matched...could use some modern updates but, in the end, your there to ear right? The decor doesn't stop me from coming back."
13017,Great prices nice folks
13018,"I had a wonderful meal here.  It's a small place, which makes it feel homey.  Excellent service, too."
13019,Went here to shop before flying home an when we checking out the cashier did nothing to help us box our stuff an as you can imagine we had quite a few stuff as we had to buy 2 boxes an tape an the cashier just stood there an watched us box our products we were purchasing from this location.. Thought they were supposed to be helpful an friendly?.. 2 stars üôÑüòëüòî
13020,Good price.
13021,Great place very fun for kids n adults

13025,Awesome food everytime
13026,"Delicious, well maintained area, interesting visit."

13044,Food is often cold or fries arent fresh. Inconsistent. Overall fair considering my overall experience and expectations for McDonalds. Its best to go wen theres a medium amount of business.
13045,"Awesome place, loved it"
13046,"Food was good, customer service was tried. It was a very busy time, and so we understood that they were done and wanted to go home.

Thai tea is definitely lipton based, not terrible, but it is distinctive.

The noodles appear to all be made in house, so the udone, for example, is much different here than anywhere else in town. I think the Thai Orchid could benefit from a bit larger area, going from the rule of build for the busiest. A large number of people came in for carryout amd had to wait at the counter in a very traffic-heavy area.

The food was good, healthy portions, and they are very happy to make anything vegetarian (their menu says vegan)."
13047,"Always friendly knowledgeable staff and competitive prices.  Shop local, keep local money in Alaska!"
13048,Excellent Mongolian beef and sesame chicken.

13053,Learned about Alaska's heritage and language.
13054,"Great selection of electronics, parts, cables and more."
13055,"They've held up well during the lock down. Their great salsa bar is now packed in individual servings, which is fine. Got a large order to go, everything was great. Special of the day was birria, which is not usually seen at these latitudes. Beef marinated and cooked until everything falls apart, saucy and flavorful but not spicy - quite excellent."
13056,Yummy pizza and great beer selection. Love the chicken bbq pie.
13057,What a special place. Period
13058,"Placed my order online for a 12pm pick-up.  I arrived early at 11:45 and stood by the sign that said ""Skip the line, pick-up here"" (or something similar).  But with only one person working the desk, I was forced to still wait in line.  Additionally, even though I scheduled a 12pm pick-up, my food was waiting on a shelf in a bag upon arrival.  The fries were in the same container that I should have been served had I dined-in and not in something enclosed to keep them warm.  When I got back to work to eat, just as I assumed, everything was cold.  I ate it because I was hungry but I won't waste my time here again and recommend no one else does either."
13059,"A wonderful restaurant where you might not look for it initially. The Pad Thai is absolutely amazing, as is everything else I have had the pleasure of trying here. Very clean, wonderful service, and great prices!"
13060,Great!
13061,Last one in existence! Jk but it's nostalgic and fantastic ü§òüèº

13063,Great food and service was awesome
13064,Rude and picky owner. I have been working on their application for 30 minutes and they never accepted it and never called me back like they told me. I have been a professional in restaurant business for over three years and they reject me. What a waste of time. Stupid atmosphere
13065,"Opthalmic Associates has both good eye doctors and excellent helpers to measure eye pressure, etc.  I would recommend them to anyone.  They are courteous, and treat patients well.  I highly trust them."

13067,Elisia and Erica were awesome.  Best sub I have had in a long time
13068,"Great atmosphere,  very professional staff. I got my eyebrows done with a henna tinting, by Helen, and she was phenomenal. I'm new to the whole eyebrow game, and she walked me through the whole process, and made sure everything was to my liking. Will definitely be going back!"
13069,"One of the nicer RV parks in Alaska, especially if you can get a water front spot. Staff is friendly and helpful. Bathrooms are clean and showers are included. Also, has full hookups, water, sewer, electricity, and TV."
13070,Yummm
13071,Love it
13072,Their beef and broccoli entree is 98% semi-rotten broccoli and 2% beef. If you‚Äôre lucky.
13073,Geocaching anyone? Love in the time of Covid...
13074,Got order completely wrong food was not cooked very well
13075,Best ice cream ever

13077,Haven't ate there yet. But the manager Mary is really nice as well as the rest of the staff I met. Recently applied for a job there as a waiter. Excited to work there.
13078,Consistent and clean
13079,"Omg the drive thru lane was long which was understandable since I went there on a Friday like around 9 pm... the person taking my order spunded like he was kind of annoyed because I was taking too long to pick, and when I did, he just told me to go next window. When I got my food, it was hot, fresh and the condiments like sauces and straws i requested  was actually in the bag. The one that handed me my order was actually nice and wish me a good night."
13080,"McDonald's is McDonald's, no matter where you are in the world. Nothing much more to say."
13081,Terribly bland tacos. Tiny plate of rice and beans for $5! Much prefer Taco king. The staff is nice though.
13082,Good deals
13083,"Great food, friendly staff, fast service, great prices....thank you..."
13084,Crew was very friendly and very knowledgeable and informative of the area.
13085,App directions stated to enter store for pick up. Had to go through the drive thru. It was quick though.
13086,"Amazing! I called ahead,  the pharmacy staff was hustling to get prescriptions filled before closing. This was the only pharmacy open. They squeezed my prescription in too. The PharmD was headed out to his car and came back into work to help me. His two more minutes of service kept my loved one from going back to the emergency room. Thank you!!!"
13087,Always a good burger and the best Chinese food on the Palmer area. They deliver also.
13088,"The food was very good and authentic.  Fast, friendly service.  Easy in and out service."
13089,Disappointing.  Prices were high and pastries were old.
13090,Uncooked fries.
13091,Saw the Celtic Woman Christmas concert. Loved the venue and ease of preordering drinks for the intermission.
13092,Today was awesome. Saw some vast country. So beautiful to.   I have flown with John before and will do it again...  I totally recommend flying with John.
13093,The girl made a sloppy sandwich. I was ignored when I tryed to slow her down. The young man that cashed me out was very rude. My hand was there and he put the change on the counter. Only to me. Why.? Was I a bad person? I was polite. And was treated poorly.
13094,Great smoked meats and friendly service. Definitely on my recommended list.
13095,"Nice staff, better than Lowe‚Äôs and Homedepot combined."
13096,"Great service, great prices, and great products both new and used."

13098,Best place to buy produce in Juneau.
13099,Excellent service and convenient location
13100,"I've had bodywork done on a couple vehicles at Chaz. They do great work, for a fair price. If you need bodywork done, I would highly recommend taking your vehicle to Chaz Limited Collision Express."
13101,All in all it's a Burger King. They are very much the same no matter where you go but this particular one has fantastic staff that are incredibly friendly. Service is quick and with a smile. They even have some healthy options on the menu.
13102,"The best food out of our 2 weeks roadtrip in the interior Alaska from the points of food presentation, creativity, & taste. It is a must!"
13103,This is the best Mexican food in the valley.
13104,great food and atmosphere!
13105,No vegetarian food :(
13106,Convenient location in tok. Plenty of trees for setting up a hammock. There are also lots of RV hookups and showers and a laundry facility are available if you stay here
13107,Yum! Great sushi and atmosphere. They do a fantastic job working food allergies as well. Great place for large parties as well as small groups.
13108,Nice view
13109,They do a very good job
13110,Great place to get in a fist/gun fight.
13111,Friendly service
13112,Normal sort of Walmart
13113,"Walked in to get a haircut, was greeted by friendly staff in a clean establishment. I was immediately taken to a chair where a nice gentleman from Guatemala gave me a great haircut and did so VERY fast.
When I went to pay, I found out that they are not equipped to accept debit or credit cards. Luckily I had $18 in cash on me. $15 for a cut and tipped $3. Would have tipped $5 if I'd had it. I will definatly return here for my next cut."
13114,Drives around with there highbeams on blinding other drivers on the roadway even after half dozen other cars flashed lights at them. Not a very safe ride at sll
13115,Is what it is
13116,My favorite place to eat
13117,Good beer
13118,Awesome pizza
13119,The drive through women was extremely rude for no reason and when time for our order she only gave us 1 order from 3 people but charged everything we ordered...I will not recommend this buger king to anyone....but the service was pretty fast.
13120,Fun
13121,They're  out of some foods quite a bit which annoys me -1 star. LOVE their apple pies +1 star. Hate there nuggets like alot -2 stars dislike their burgers -1 star. Their smoothies are decent and I like the mcflurry every so often +2 stars. In total it's four stars I'd reccomend when it's close and you're hungry.
13122,Literally just gravel
13123,Clean. Lots to see. Museums.  Playground.  Lots of great shops
13124,"The service was incredibly slow and the meat calzone was very dry. There wasn't any visible sauce in it. The waitress brought a side of it to me and another customer,who ordered a combo calzone, upon request."
13125,We eat there when we go to Anchorage.
13126,This is a second time I am renting a car within a last two months. The car is not ready for me to pick it up.
13127,"Great experience!
We've bought a car and had service done.  Had a great experience every time."

AHHH HEAVEN FOR 2 MEALS."
13131,It's McDonald's
13132,"5 days into a 30 day stay.

So far so amazing. Friendly service, clean rooms. House keeping did a great job and was mindful of my person items during cleaning.

Close to ocean, lake, hiking, ocean center, walking distance to everything.

Missing some normal things I have come to expect from hotels and extended stays, especially at this price, but over 5 stars."
13133,Very helpful employees and the store is always clean and stocked.

13140,Great Chinese food
13141,Great customer service
13142,Great location for viewing dog sled racing!
13143,The GAPCO Customer appreciation day is a great deal. $5 for a medium.
13144,Accounts paid in full over 1 yr and still not reporting paid on my credit report. These people don't try to help you and they don't report properly when collections have been paid in full!
13145,Is an okay place to have fast food at this particular location in Fairbanks right nex to fred meyer is a lot slower than other places but the food is great. Also make sure u get the salsa u asked for since they on 3 separate times I went through the drive through they forgot to give me my fire salsa I requested.
13146,Lots of great places all in one stop. Hate that bridge though lol.
13147,This is my go-to when we go go Juneau. SO good! Literally the only thing in that town that makes me happy is having lunch or dinner at Canton.
13148,Great service
13149,Beautiful... Nothing more to say
13150,NICE place to eat. GOOD food.
13151,"This place is out of the way but worth the trip to University south. It has a sign and is well marked. There are windows to look out on the runway. The restaurant is appropriately themed around aviation. This is the best pizza I've had since moving to Alaska. There are a few good pizza places here but none are as good. It's a bit spendy for 12"" pizzas but not bad. The staff was super friendly and helped our large group get tables during a busy service  Well worth the visit, you won't be disappointed. I'm definitely returning."
13152,"This car wash does not clean well at all. I bought the mudblaster wash ($18) and windshield, headlights and entire rear of car was still filthy. Do not waste your money here. Also a Laser Wash does better."
13153,"Decent beer, ok service.. Since the owner responded to my review, let me clarify. The ""ok service"" referenced was in regards to the rude bar back working the day I visited. She was curt and unhelpful. Thankfully the bartender or cashier was friendly and helpful. I will not visit again."
13154,Great Food!
13155,"Small but precious!
I love spend some time on the control tower looking the seaplanes landing and taking off."
13156,Great park
13157,"We went for snowmobiling and it was great. They offer coats, bibs, sturdy boots, and gaiters. Everything was in good condition. They took us out to the lake so we had wide open space to ride around!! Definitely recommend"
13158,Not a nice group. No business from me.
13159,Great entrees! Homemade refried beans and rice were delicious. Chips and salsa/guacamole were just ok.
13160,"I went to visit my mom who was staying there, got a drink at the restaraunt. Very reasonably priced and very kind staff."
13161,"Food was excellent. It was late, and they served us quickly. Love this!!"
13162,Ok
13163,Hope to return
13164,Loved it.. high-quality... Highly suggest the Mongolian beef

13168,September set menu was divine from start to finish
13169,Great store and great employees!
13170,"Good location, helpful staff"
13171,Delicious sushi
13172,"If you are tired of eating fast food and are looking for a place that is unexpected, look no further. You would never guess that such high quality food is right off the highway outside of Anchorage. A great place to sit down and feel like you are somewhere else or look out the window facing south and enjoy the view. Some of the best take-out pizza I have ever bought as well."
13173,I have been a member here for years. And in the last couple years this place has gone way WAY down hill. It's always dirty and the equipment is not kept up very well anymore. It's like they just dont care anymore. Kinda sad really it used to be a good alternative to the over priced other place out here. Now not so much.
13174,Very nice
13175,Legit
13176,"Auburn is awesome, made shopping and custom order a breeze! Much better selection and service than any other furniture store in Anchorage."
13177,We always enjoy the food we get here. The handmade pretzel with cheese is by far our favorite thing in the menu. Often times we just go for that. Lots of people enjoy the variety of unique beers they have to offer. The atmosphere is very fun and casual. We always have a good time!
13178,"Had the veggie tart. Flavor was nice but the bottom side of the crust was so tough, even the knife couldn't cut through it. We won't be back."
13179,Placed order watched 3 others that ordered after get their food first. And drive through  kept giving the wrong order.
13180,It's ok for a grocery store.
13181,Can't wait for the Music in the Garden to start up again
13182,Legit
13183,Its ok
13184,"Love this place! It just opened for the season. A good place to spend a day walking around enjoying the weather and and ""window shopping"" for that special or unique gift. It has an awry of items. I love the Local Artists that bring their talents to display and show their work for us to enjoy. O' and let's not forget the FOOD! Many varieties that show our diversity here in Alaska. YUMMY!!"
13185,Food n services has been great every visit.
13186,"Have not had a bad experience yet. Service is great, food is tasty and prices are not that bad compared to other restaurants with similar food choices. Only negative that I could give it would be it gets loud when it's busy. But i can deal with that. üòä"
13187,"I always  prefer to wash my car by hand ,I can do that here ,plus if you are a night  owl like me you can take your time,that makes it number one  for me."
13188,It's a cozy downtown hotel
13189,"Nice place, good food, beds are a little stiff"
13190,"We were a group of 20 so we split up into two groups. Half of us did the virtual reality room, and the other half did the escape room, then we switched. Both experiences were magnificent! The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. The equipment was in good condition. The storyline and clues in the escape room were creative. Highly recommend!"
13191,"Great pizza, appetizers and decorations"
13192,"Visited as a tourist. It's a nice market, but a bit overwhelming in the fresh fish department. Cafe/bakery area was fantastic and they sell several Alaska products."
13193,Wish the bumper boats still where a thing
13194,"These folks never disappoint , kind compassionate, personable and very professional in every way!üëç‚ÄºÔ∏è"
13195,"Nice variety of stores, friendly staff, and has a charming feel to it."
13196,One of the few classy joints in Fairbanks. Be sure to save room for their desserts- they have the best peanut butter pie in town.
13197,"purchased a faulty product. tried to get it replaced, had the receipt and the packaging the faulty product was lost '' i was frustrated and chucked it in the woods'' but they needed the rock hard hunk of putty so that pissed me off. if you want a bit more lenience go to a Napa or an Auto-zone the prices at Orielly's too high as it is."
13198,Won‚Äôt eat here ever Again
13199,Best price.
13200,V.good pizza...very good dough AND flavor.
13201,"Edit: I had a bad experience once, detailed below, but have had much more successful, non-eventful, experiences since.

------------------------------------

Had an appointment around noon on a Sunday. Got there early and checked in, no issues. I hang out, wait about 30 minutes past my scheduled time before I ask what's going on. I was informed I'd have another 30 minutes to wait before I would be helped.

I could understand if I had just walked in, but I had a scheduled appointment. That should have been honored before walk ins. A 45 minute outing had more than doubled to a two hour wait.

I wasn't even notified that I was, in fact, still on the list or that they weren't expecting to meet my scheduled time. No apologies either. Just some stone cold, expressionless, ""30 more minutes"".

Incredibly frustrated with this place's ability to manage customers expectations and their 'scheduling'."
13202,We went in just browsing after calling around to a few stores in town. Mark was very knowledgeable and helpful. We took the mattress test and were able to narrow down our search to just a few based on our body types. We went and did some research and came back. Christy was just as helpful and got us set up with mattress and accessories we wanted.
13203,The best
13204,My go to shopping palace.
13205,The best store
13206,Pizza heaven choose your own toppings and the flaxseed dough was delish
13207,"Wendy‚Äôs is a nice change.  Great staff and kind workers. They are doing a great job so far. The first time I went they ran out of bacon but they handled the situation. The second time I went the window communication was not working some part of ordering in drive thru so I went inside. I cut my hand getting out of my truck and the lady at counter was so in it while getting my order and wet napkins to clean up my hand. She offered first aid kit and bandaids but I declined. They are a great addition to Palmer plus they have a few fast healthier choices which is perfect for my family on those days we need food fast!
Update....
I have had to horrible experiences in a row where Wendy‚Äôs has not given regular nuggets but instead the fire hot nuggets. The two times were once delivered and once through drive through I am so angry the children I fed couldn‚Äôt eat them one cried and the other got bumps her tongue (irritated taste buds) I am not ever going there again. I feel it was on purpose and amusing to the employees. The nuggets are so spiced like fire it‚Äôs awful.
Wendy‚Äôs quickly nose dived to one star."
13208,"This place was a dump.  very limited selection of product, the place was very dirty and the floors were disgusting.  The cashier was biting her finger nails and looking at her phone the whole time we were in line, never said hi or anything.  We will never go in that store again and I'm not sure why any of the locals would either."
13209,I prefer the capital cafe for breakfast on Saturdays because they serve breakfast until they close at 2 and they are less busy than other popular local options (No wait times!). They have a few unique offerings and a kids menu that is fairly priced. My family sticks to a couple of servers who know us well and provide great customer service.
13210,"I was aided in finding my friend. Not only that, I was escorted to the room. Thank you."
13211,Great pizza super crispy love the crust here oven baked fire
13212,Clean and freindly lite on merchandise
13213,A little more that you would expect
13214,So much fun! The rooms are well thought out and our team had an amazing time! We can't wait for the new room to be built! The owners are incredibly sweet and helpful as well. Hands down the best escape room experience in Alaska üòÅ
13215,Love lowes
13216,Expensive for wine. Friendly staff.
13217,"Such an incredible place! The workers are super friendly and helpful. The many different things they do for different seasons and holidays is neat, and of course it's always cool to pet some reindeer. I will definitely come back when I get the chance"
13218,I ordered online and still had to wait an addition 20 minutes . It was only a cold coffee üòí
13219,Ski trails connecting to Creamers Field are the hidden treasures of Fairbanks.
13220,Great hike to the glacier viewing area.  Keeps getting a little longer every year. Trail is well maintained for ALASKA.
13221,Atmosphere and food were great.
13222,"Mediocre pies, dirty, grungy building. less than kind workers.

Edit: there is a perfect example of the latter seen below. I've seen you, Mr. Owner, verbally attracting people in the review section simply for sharing their opinion. Please respect that different people have different opinions."
13223,"Great atmosphere and friendly service. I only had a couple drinks and the Bavarian pretzel, and it's definitely a must have"
13224,"Pretty simple trail but definitely wouldn't go out of my way to do this one. We hiked it around midnight (only ones there) and saw a ton of porcupines which was awesome! but during the day its crowded and you won't see much, if any wildlife if that's what you're into."
13225,I loved every thing! We go almost every weekend!
13226,"Excellent value, free pickup/drop-off at the airport, included breakfast is good. Service is great; Lyna and Lani were especially helpful during our stay."
13227,Best donuts ever
13228,"Consistently do a good job, better than most of the local competitors."
13229,"Money well spent. Our guides were awesome, we spent most our time with Rachel, she did a great job keeping everyone safe and excited. Her jokes were funny and they helped to ease some fear. Overall a fantastic experience. Have never been to a multi line zip course before so I thought the zips were fun and exciting."
13230,Where's the meat?......i ordered an Italian sub had to dig around all the veggies and finally BAM i found some meat......pretty disappointed with the sub....but as far as the employees very kind and professional
13231,Wonderfully talented staff but wish the atmosphere was more relaxing.
13232,"Three Bears is new.  Opened in December 2017.  The store has a bunch of different things inside.

1. A convenience store that has candies, drinks, clean restrooms, hot dogs and nachos etc. See photos.

2. They also have a great Liquor department.  Bear, wine, hard stuff and more.  A huge selection.  See photos.

3. Grocery store.  Great selection with great prices.  A meat dept (no prime rib), frozen foods, coolers and camp chairs.

4. The outpost is great.  Opens at 11:30 daily and closes at 8 pm.  A great place to gear up for the hunt or get that thing you forgot.

5. An Ace hardware store on the north side.

6. Gas station out front with Diesel and regular.  Good prices (3.12 for 87 octane).  RV refuelling area and heating oil and propane sales.

A great place to stock up when out and about exploring."
13233,"Bad customer service, last year I had bought a lawn mower here and it was like pulling teeth. Then two weeks ago I go in ask for a quote on 2 4 wheelers to bring to the bank and they never got back I have called and its really tough to try and do business with someone who doesn't want your business. I called eagle river Polaris and they were about the same. Then I happened to find hatcher pass Polaris in Wasilla and it was a godsend Chris was awesome she handles it all and made it a pain free easy transaction without any added set up or dealer fees like in town. I will definitely be going back to hatcher pass for all future business."
13234,"So tonight, my 3rd time ordering from here, I am a loyal customer. Not only have I been treated to exemplary customer service, I have been treated like a person. Their food is great and the portion size is very good. But their delivery drivers are amazing! I was picking my fiancee up from work and the time ran a little longer than expected. As we were heading back home we got a call from the driver saying he was here. We let him know we were a few minutes out and my brother could take the order if he was allowed to. He quickly explained the policy that prevented this and that he would wait for just a few more minutes for us. ***15 minutes later*** I pull up to my house go see this, I would say saintly, person standing with our food. He was all smiles and ""no worries"" and just really amazing towards us. So if you have a hankering for chinese food, don't want to break the bank and want to be treated like a human being, order from here and you will not be disappointed."
13235,Great food and service!!
13236,Great sushi!
13237,Denali Mac is awesome!
13238,Not the best deals u looses you a$@ off when selling games back
13239,Nice store with a great selection
13240,Great service despite being slam packed at lunch. Parking might be an issue but it's worth the hassle because the food and beer are outstanding.
13241,Excellent Museum of Alaska Histroy
13242,The Food has yet to disappoint me. Staff are super friendly. Building is nice and comfy. Best place to stop in for a bite!
13243,"Clean, well stocked & excellent customer service!!!"
13244,Busy on sundays
13245,Extremely slow...not friendly
13246,"Yesterday their card reader did not work, today only one of their drive thru mics worked. Been in the drive thru line for almost an hour and still did not receive my food."
13247,Great neighborhood shoo
13248,"Staff are push at times and argumentative. At times it's hard for them to find the right part even with a ""to go by"" - got to fats instead"
13249,Fun
13250,Very clean and it wasn‚Äôt busy at all. We went inside just 30mins before they closed and they gave great service. We came into cash a check and we don‚Äôt have an account here and wasnt sure if we would have any issues and it was a pleasant experience.
13251,"Effort to please customers is evident, owner on site is a plus. Portions are great and food is good! N."
13252,"Had 3 or 4 different employees offer to help me find what I was looking for. However, the first time I needed help it took a bit to find someone."
13253,"Went thru the drive through and was surprised to be presented with a bill that asked for a tip. Who tips at a drive through? Have I missed some new trend? If so, I‚Äôm gonna keep missing it because I am not paying another 20% for the guy at the window to take my parcel from the cook, walk 2 feet and hand it to me out a window. Especially since he seemed not very excited about taking my order while I was out sitting at the speaker.

That said, the food was pretty good. I guess I‚Äôd go back, but the guy at the window was pretty uninspired by his career path. So hopefully he will be off that day."
13254,"Great service, friendly people!"
13255,"I will give it 2 Stars only because our crab and seafood sandwiches were good. we had the rudest greeting when we walked in the door from a server who just said ""she was too busy to clean any tables. Go find something you can sit at"" in a very obnoxious way. We had a nice young man from Albania as a server but he was extremely slow. It took forever. I would not recommend this place simply because obviously there is no management that cares about bussing tables or having people that would greet customers in a nice manner no matter how busy they are or shorthanded they are. Where was the management! Someone should have been out there bussing tables and helping take care of many upset customers. We weren't the only ones that felt this way; we saw many."
13256,Been buying all of my pet supplies here exclusively for 15 years! Staff is freindly and helpful. Good variety of products and a decent rewards program. I am glad to support this awesome AK buisness.
13257,Fast affordable food
13258,"Most of the employees here are super helpful. Their knowledge and experience are on point. My husband bought my DSLR camera here and they helped him find the one I wanted for my birthday. I like to support this local business in Fairbanks, and have since gone back and bought more supplies and prints of my Alaskan adventures. One employee there likes to tell you about how amazing he is at photography and will talk at length about the equipment he likes the best for what he does. This is after I tell him I don't need his help.  So you may get a guy who talks about himself when you rather shop but there are emloyees like him everywhere. Overall a great hometown camera store."
13259,They have stuff.
13260,Love Walmart well stocked helpful employees
13261,"Sketchy people and setting, but it was the cheapest room I could find. Honestly it turned out to be a much better stay than I anticipated. Decent rooms for the price"
13262,"Best part, everyone handling my food was wearing their mask even the cooks! Food was great too. üëç"
13263,Thank you! Stranger's...
13264,No fries??
13265,I come almost every Thursday night. The customer service was fantastic considering the amount of people we bring each time we arrive.  Food is tasty!
13266,"There were not enough cashiers the wait was extra long in comparison to target and other box stores  the pharmacy however was efficient and the wait was short
They were well stocked for the most part but missing some critical ones that is why 3 stars  store was clean especially the aisles where people seem to let their children just dump things on the floor."
13267,"Lots of options for coffee, smoothies , sandwiches. Cute Lil shop. They also have outdoor and indoor seatings. You have to order at counter and you may pick it up or they can hand you over at your table. It's in downtown of Fairbanks. It's cheap and not so expensive. Good restaurant."
13268,Pretty good as far as DMV's go
13269,Nice clean and work is done in a timely manner.
13270,Wonderful place to go. I probably shouldn't tell you. It's ok we reserved our spot already.
13271,Best Chinese for the price
13272,The sales are amazing
13273,Good food friendly service. Would definitely visit again
13274,"So-so. Good service, nice people. Mediocre food."
13275,Would give 0 stars if I could. I‚Äôm trying to set up new service but I‚Äôve been waiting for almost an hour now for someone to pick up my call. About to just go do WiFi somewhere else.
13276,The food at Rosco's never disappoints. Even the salad was out of this world!
13277,This place looks sketchy but it was the best salmon I've ever had! I also got the halibut bites which were also amazing. Hidden gem!
13278,The forest is rad. Go out there. Get you some of that nature.
13279,Mostly good food.  Mostly good prices.  Mostly good service
13280,"Beautiful, well kept trails and many markers to help you along the way"
13281,"Got to love the fair, & all the stuff to see, buy, eat, &/or ride. Look forward to it every year."
13282,"It is a good place to see movies, and the staff is usually friendly."
13283,Expect delicious!
13284,Good chicken
13285,"Love these ladies! Been going here for what seems like 20 years. They always remember me, and what i drink."

13300,"Authentic menu items and quality food. Absolutely delicious! Great atmosphere, there is a bar side for a relaxed hangout or a quick bite to eat. Then there is the sit down restaurant side. Highly recommended!"
13301,very long wait for our to go order and the food was just OK I ordered  a French dip hoagie and my husband ordered a Ruben hoagie they both had barley any meat in them it was mostly bread  tge French dip hoagie I ordered had no flavor at all and the au juice was more oily than anything I also ordered a cranberry mandarin salad that was very delicious and we both ordered fries and those were also very good but probably not good enough to come again it's too expensive for what we got would rather go to firehouse subs
13302,"Never one to disappoint, Marx bros knocked it out again.  Staff was great, attentive and helpful.  Atmosphere varied by patrons  from a little loud to quiet and intimate.
Food was fantastic.  Salads were prepaired well, greens were fresh and crisp.  Main dishes were amazing.  Flavorful and prepared perfectly.

Always worth a little extra to come here.  From the coat service to the staff and food, every detail is taken into consideration."
13303,Great pizza. 10/10
13304,Food is always good there. Sushi is top notch and the cooked food is good as well. There service there is always fast and very friendly and helpful.
13305,Great clothes & very trendy

13312,"bad experience using their ""switch"" program due to employees lack of information and knowledge. Very helpful prior to the sale."
13313,Great sushi.
13314,There is always something new to see when you stroll down the boardwalk. It is a safe and beautiful place to go when you want to take a walk away from the city.
13315,Beautiful place hard drive but worth it
13316,Outdoor exhibits
13317,"Fresh everything, the price is amazing ESPECIALLY for it being Alaska ( we just moved up from Texas ). I'm still a fan of McDonald's fries but these burgers beat all the food chains. The service was good too. Next time we'll try the shakes."
13318,"Fantastic place to bring the family and kids a beautiful gift shop little pricey but the adventure is what it's about seeing the Reindeer, visiting Santa Claus..."
13319,"Asian market with food, coffee, and salad bar.  Higher prices than FM or SW, lower than Nat Pant.  Live lobsters and oysters."
13320,Nice place to see glacier
13321,Easy
13322,"Good food, very good soup's friendly"
13323,I got take out today and it dosent look like anything on the website it said that there were 4 picies of French toast and there was only 2
13324,"They're pretty sweet, though when you bring your dog or cat to day care, you don't really get to see what's happening behind the scenes."
13325,"Excellent services, and Tacos were very good. Nice local ""older"" Alaskan environment! Will definitely go again! N."
13326,Large outdoor warehouse with excellent prices.
13327,"Wow, thats all...is WOW!"
13328,"I'm going to give them 5 stars even though I just left and they didn't have my neck bones. Lol but I should've gotten it last time I was here so that was my fault. But... like someone else said, their variety of different foods from different backgrounds makes this place A1. Way better than walmart. Even CARRS or Fred Myers, because of the prices! Also agreeable with the shady area, but, eh... I've been to worse places. My review is on the food they provide, which is pretty good. Hopefully I won't have to come back and change it. Lol"
13329,"One of the best dining facilities in the Air Force. Great selection, plenty of space."
13330,Always on spot and friendly
13331,Delicious burgers
13332,I LOVE their Golden Pain Killer drink & quick service.. AMAZING!!!
13333,"Nice people, incredible sushi."
13334,"Always great, fast, friendly service and their food is ALWAYS AMAZING!"
13335,Great food and the best beer brewed in Anchorage is served here fresh. Once you go local there is no comparison.
13336,"Great coffee, open 24 hours!"
13337,Not what it used to be. But still good to walk off a meal in.
13338,The people were all super friendly and helpful. This was the first shop I had been into and they were very patient and willing to answer any questions I had.
13339,Very long wait.
13340,"These donuts are so good! They are always fresh and served with a smile. I know the family personally and would love for you to try their amazing place.

My favorite donuts there are the blueberry cake and maple triangle with cream. Soooo good :-)

I only pop in every once in a while but usually able to get some lovely treats for my errand stops."
13341,A Talkeetna landmark. Awesome baked goods and pizza. The oatmeal raisin cookies were wonderful and I got tons of them for a great price.
13342,Fudge.  What else can you say.
13343,Excellent service!  Great selection of American Made Filson ware.
13344,Pretty dang good!!
13345,"Clearly and hands down the best pizza in Anchorage. I refuse accept any other opinion.
I've been ordering pizza from this place for 6 or 7 years and I havent found a place in Anchorage that does a better job.
Pizza is always hot and the toppings are covering the whole pizza.
Staff is quick and friendly and always easy to talk to."
13346,Just pizza
13347,"Good Staff, informative"
13348,Servers are great. Food is good. Hostess was painfully rude but the manger put her in her place. So overall...not a bad way to spend an evening.
13349,Weird hours
13350,Will get your order wrong if you ask them to add extra ingredients or if you order too much
13351,The food is fantastic. Maybe the best bacon I have ever tasted. Five of us ordered eggs 5 different ways and all were cooked to perfection. My breve was so yumny. Service was equally good. If you need to wait for for a table I promise it's completely worth it. Our only complaint was the music was too loud. It was difficult to converse.
13352,"Had breakfast today, smashed potatoes,  bacon,  onions,  gruyere cheese melted and eggs on top...lotta love"
13353,Nice choice of fresh flowers and friendly staff
13354,"I think it is an excellent place to eat, and to hang loose."
13355,The only two down sides- can be expensive and the cashiers can be slow.
13356,Amazing!!!   YUMMMAY
13357,Food is real good!
13358,THE BEST coffee in Alaska!!!
13359,Very nice store and the sales reps were extremely helpful and very nice!!! Great selection and highly recommend stopping by!!!
13360,"Some delicious dished (halibut stuffed with crab) and what would theoretically be a great location, but window tables in June were way to hot unless the blinds were closed and the restaurant was uncomfortably packed and super noisy. The service was good, but overall not my favorite experience.   On the other hand we loved the nearby Glacier Brewhouse, which while super busy was really pleasant."
13361,Best donuts in Ancorage.
13362,Nice people good selection
13363,Best hair dresser in Anchorage
13364,Good to visit but it is designed to care for permanently injured animals instead of being a zoo.  Best if you are able to time your visit with some of the animal feeding times.  We saw the porcupine being fed and it was great to be able to see it being much more active
13365,"Typical Starbucks.   Staff has always been pleasant.  Location is mostly convenient, west bound has to turn early or make a uturn at C street.  Decent location.  Have not been inside in a while, but drive through is quick most of the time."
13366,This is a brand new store. I like the layout and how fresh and clean everything is!
13367,"Great omelets, and the friendly reception would endear you to the place even if their food wasn't so good."
13368,"Very cute place with lots of neat info, kind people, and great old timey vibes."
13369,"If you've never seen ice sculptures, it's pretty cool. After seeing the competition live, it's not the same..."
13370,"Ordered steak, got a pile of mush.. ."
13371,Went to elementary school near by this area(Kincaid Elementary)grew up with field trips to this park is always been a good school and family experience i recommend it for families and friends
13372,"Well, the food was good and the place was clean. I like the self service screens. The problem I have is the drunk guy sitting with two bottles if liquor in the corner. Neither were open, but the guy was super annoying . Can Anchorage do anything proactive about their drunks and homeless? It's not McDonald's fault but..."
13373,Consistent with other Papa Murphy locations. The drive through is fantastic and a nice addition.
13374,"(Translated by Google) Clean and tidy .. food home-style .. but far too large portions .. price-performance ratio ok

(Original)
Sauber und ordentlich.. Essen gutb√ºrgerlich.. aber viel zu grosse Portionen.. Preis-Leisungsverh√§ltnis ok"
13375,Excellent service
13376,"A Ninilchik staple! Awesome food, good service. My favorite dish is the catch of the day , bring in fresh halibut and they'll cook it up any way you want!"
13377,Great location and it's clean
13378,Staff could be a little more professional. Though I've needed parts that they did not have and they were able to have them shipped from Anchorage by the next day at no additional charge.
13379,"Delish, but it would be less messy if they put the sauce on the bottom."
13380,Interesting.
13381,Highly recommend stop.  Walk right up to waterfall.
13382,Definitely one of my best places to go. If they don't have it and you ask.  Next time you go it's there.   Customer service is the best
13383,"Great store to shop for unique gifts while you sip on a coffee from their Starbucks. If they don't have the book you need, they'll order it! (Lose a star due to sometimes messy restrooms)."
13384,Lacks appearance and can be ruff on customers the bartenders are good at there beverage skills but tend to over serve the drinks the bar is lacking all aspects to make it good entertainment
13385,"9-4-2020
Got exactly what we ordered and were friendly and understanding of changes when ordering(elderly mother and 1st grader if you catch my drift).  Went to the Abbott location three times in a row(2 month span) they messed up the 2 of 3 items on the each visit. Never going to the Abbott one again!"
13386,Great food and service. The burgers are great and fries are outstanding. A must stop and dine in Delta.
13387,Wow! Very good! Coming back ...
13388,Had very good help in finding what we needed
13389,"Clean, friendly, convenient."
13390,"A Half Turkey San, with a cup of Clam Chowder"
13391,"Heard they offer great prices and are customer friendly, thats important, especially now a days"
13392,Good place better than Pet Emporium but not easy access
13393,Good food!!! Loved the tater tots...
13394,Wish they would do more white chocolate cherry bread
13395,Nice old hotel... convenient location...
13396,Takes long time to be seen
13397,The hours are terrible
13398,"Having grown up in Eagle River, Pizza Man was a stable of my childhood. We still stop in and the food is as delicious as it has always been. Get the cheese bread and ranch. ü§§"
13399,"Front desk receptionist was very rude and overall staff vibe was unfriendly. Two friends and I had shown up for the first time through a recommendation from a friend, and the receptionist was engaged in her cell phone for a good 10 seconds before acknowledging us. Then speaks to us in an annoyed manner, about how walk-ins are on a first come first serve basis, and we couldn't book an appointment right then for the next opening, but if we wanted an appointment we'd have to book it online. Understandable, but it was our first time, there was no need for the attitude. My friend had ended up waiting while we browsed the rest of the store, but left after she seen other customers walk-in and get the same treatment from other staff. Really?! Customer service is EVERYTHING, seldom do I care to write these but this was just ridiculous."
13400,"Nice location. I believe the coffee here is mediocre. Food is okay.
The atmosphere and design of store is very nice."
13401,"Good coffee, friendly staff, quick turns"
13402,Prity good food service and alaskan small town feel will review her when I go again
13403,Old and small
13404,"Unbelievable how little they care. Ordered delivery with cash payment, 2 hours have gone by and still no delivery driver, they won't answer the phone, and they haven't called me. Will never order from here again."
13405,"Great place to get meat for projects,  brisket for corned beef, why pay 10$ a pound for corned beef, when you can make your own . Also a pork belly for bacon."
13406,Love It! The bagels are amazing!
13407,"Great selection but No drip coffee! Very friendly service, quick!"
13408,Love there food
13409,"Not the best restroom, but it gets the job done. Usually not too busy."
13410,Good deals but lots of crazies
13411,"Counter people overall seemed to be in a bad mood today.  No please or thank yous, no smiles or greetings, like they all were bothered to be there.  We spent over $500 getting ready for a fishing trip.  If we had the time, we would have left and gone somewhere else."
13412,How in the hell do you charge for parking
13413,Convenient and predictable. Great when you're running from meeting to meeting and you need a quick option.
13414,Gorgeous views right next to the marina!
13415,"I called them for a conex van and the woman quoted me for a price. I asked her if they delivered and she said yes it included delivery. Then..... I went over to purchase the conex and she told me that there was a 250.00 per hour delivery charge!! And. She told me she could not deliver it for a week. The employee that showed me the conex asked me if I wanted it today or tomorrow.
So, it was very confusing and I was treated like a red headed stepchild!!
Looks like I will not be going back there anymore.
No one was wearing masks and everyone was on their cellphones.
Very disappointed."
13416,Beautiful
13417,Awesome
13418,"Very nice people. Expensive, yet delicious."
13419,Is pretty w
13420,Great customer service awesome location
13421,I like to get stoned with my friend there
13422,We rode through the woods and down to the river where the views of the glacier were amazing! Our guide was helpful and knowledgeable. The horses were gentle and we'll trained. I would recommend this activity to people of all ages.
13423,Since 3 Bears has come to Ninilchik it has been a relief to know there is somewhere close that carries your necessity. Thank You
13424,Best body work I've seen.
13425,Food was really good and huge portions. Very good value for money. Service was terrible.
13426,Friendly staff. Usually plenty of seating. Not too expensive. Nice treat after walking around town.
13427,Good! Go eat there.
13428,"We ate at the restaurant and the service was great and the appetizers were amazing. We got the special that had crawfish, halibut and rice and it was meh with undercooked rice. But the baked brie was absolutely amazing and worth the whole experience. We will definitely be back!"
13429,"Took some friends that were visiting from  Alabama. Great views, free binoculars. Restrooms were well taken care of. There's a short (about one mile) trail with different view spots."
13430,Very cool place. Got to see all the wildlife we otherwise didn't run into in the wild. Staff was friendly.
13431,Cody is the best!
13432,eh
13433,"Very small, the shoppette on most post are bigger. They do very well for what limited space they have. The small PX would be of better use if they gave up their space to the commissary. Pretty friendly group of employees. Was able to find everything I was looking for."
13434,Most excellent Mexican food. Coming from ElPaso Texas h Juarez Mex this place does a great job with flavors and portions.
13435,Work smartah not hardah.
13436,"Fun bar, lively upbeat crowd, staffing could have been much more attentive, but due to Halloween costume contest, crowds made it a bit difficult. Music was ok, could have been more up to date, more hip hop, possible r& b, 1980-1990's theme music party dances possibly. The judging of costume contest was absolutely horrible, very disappointing."
13437,"Best place to camp in cooper landing for red salmon fishing. Paved throughout no hook ups but each sit has a Punic table and fire pit. Well developed trails along the river. Extremely busy during the first two weeks of the fishing season or the month of June. Almost always have to make reservations months in advance for June and July. Early or later than that there are always a few sites open for drive up folks. Great place for the family, watch out for bears!"
13438,Great burgers but really crowded space.
13439,"Best ever!!!!  Kelly & Dr. Burrill were both outstanding and did a great job! I know what a bad patient I am, but they made the visit fun!  I will come back!"
13440,It was great next time you need a car or a truck go to to Kendall in anchorage love them.millie
13441,Nothing comes with sides!! it would be a great deal if they did. $10 for a grilled cheese you can make it home! Add 5 bucks for small thing of fries is ridiculous!! Management cares more about their profits than guest service.
13442,"I had my silverado detailed yesterday, and this place is no joke, they made my truck look better than when i first bought it. Aaron and his crew were very proffesional and they will have me back!"
13443,Did my order right
13444,Good place. They have liquor license now!
13445,"The food is excellent, but it's cooked to order, so dont go, if you're in a hurry. The service is friendly, and the prices are ok."
13446,Apparently they are reservations only ü§î Front of the house seems to be tough for this spot üòû
13447,"Never one to disappoint, Marx bros knocked it out again.  Staff was great, attentive and helpful.  Atmosphere varied by patrons  from a little loud to quiet and intimate.
Food was fantastic.  Salads were prepaired well, greens were fresh and crisp.  Main dishes were amazing.  Flavorful and prepared perfectly.

Always worth a little extra to come here.  From the coat service to the staff and food, every detail is taken into consideration."
13448,"One of the best parks in Anchorage.  Great playground for the kids, lush long fields for pets to run."
13449,This place is amazing. Closed my eyes for a second because it was so good. All made from scratch. I had the vegetable ramen and I'm not a vegetarian but it still was great.
13450,"The food and atmosphere are great, though the service was disappointing. Our server acted like we were occupying her time. The only time she seemed to try to be nice--too nice, now--was when my father expressed concern about how they had mishandled our bill. But because she was now being called out on her attitude, she became artificially saccharine."
13451,Very nice hardware store! Not as big as the one downtown but it have an amazingly amount of stuff. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.
13452,Beautiful place
13453,"The Nature Center (and Raptor Center) are within very close proximity to each other and quite a bit smaller than one would expect or anticipate. That being said, The Nature Center is cheerfully and brightly lit and has quite a variety of hands on things for kiddos to touch and marvel at. Close quarters may cause a family to wait on the decking prior to taking their turn inside the building; however, it's worth the wait if looking at various paw prints/tracks, feeling different fur samples, etc. isn't something your kids have had an opportunity to experience before. Be forewarned that The Nature Center also contains a gift shop. Make sure to express, to your bigs and smalls alike, what your intentions are prior to entering in so that ground rules are laid down before being inaindated with all the pretty thingsüòä Over-all, the Nature Center may be small; but, if you've taken the tram up the side of Mt. Roberts, The Nature Center is a cozy, nice, quaint space to pop on in and see. 5 stars for cleanliness, helpfuness, atmosphere, and hands on science/learning fun for kids."
13454,$10 to launch a boat and $5 to park. Or you can go to the public access and pay Nothing!
13455,"Things are way over priced, but otherwise had a good time"
13456,Great service
13457,Separate family locker room is awesome. Nice play area for little ones.
13458,Service is always great
13459,GreAt variety of goods
13460,Clean and friendly
13461,"The food at this downtown eatery is interesting and looks beautiful. Lots of options on the menu with  plenty of things you could share -- great for communal eaters like our crew. Our tostones were a  little tough and not very flavorful. Drive in burger + fries, chicken adobo, and the Caesar were all good. We'll return to try other things on the menu."
13462,Very friendly and incredibly helpful staff... they went out of their way to quickly and securely accommodate our group's logistical concerns.
13463,It's a hole
13464,Service is lacking but food is still good
13465,Very good service ü§©
13466,Food is good. Drive up can be busy at times. Be patient.
13467,Good selection of frozen yogurt flavors and so many choices of toppings! Employees are always friendly and pricing is super reasonable! Will definitely be back!
13468,"Everything is amazing, best service I had in a long time!!"
13469,"service is quick, crepes are tasty, but menu could use some work, consistantly looking up is hard on the kids trying to decide."
13470,A good way to see Alaska and travel between Seward and Fairbanks
13471,Good prices
13472,I am addicted to these sandwiches they taste great. I just do not like paying for parking.
13473,"Very good sushi, one of our favorite places in Anchorage"
13474,Very beautiful!!!! I loved it
13475,Always a welcoming grocery store with helpful workers.
13476,Great Team Happy Workers. Clean inside & outside. Customer Service 5*'s !
13477,"Bubble Room Lounge for food service unacceptably slow, allow an hour after ordering for the food to arrive.  The cod was succulent, moist, excellent.  The cod as a burger was okay.  Service for attention was was spotty from the bartender."
13478,By far the best wings in town! Well worth the price and the time! Cooked to order!!!
13479,Date night relaxing view of sunset
13480,"I meet with a guest from out of town and her room was very nice...clean, well decorated...very enjoyable. The front desk staff was so sweet."
13481,Good bed and breakfast cocktails too
13482,Cute place good food. Friendly staff even when they are busy
13483,I was so ready for a great philly for dinner tonight n I was so disappointed with the philly!  It was salty n it had more bread than meat. I didn't have more than 2 small bites n I was so done with it..... I know I will be going back to the other place for a great philly. üò†üëéüåØüò°
13484,Food
13485,Nice quiet area
13486,"Really tasty food, great service & hospitality, a big menu, and a spotless dining room. Looking forward to going back."
13487,By far the best kept Walmart. Every time I have been here the employees have been friendly and helpful.
13488,"Great place to walk around and learn about plants and gardens by seeing them, planted and cared for by professionals."
13489,Loved it!!
13490,"Lane's is so great! The have quick service with delicious, flavorful tacos. They have a lot of options for the meat eater and the vegetarian. It's great that you can come in any of the tacos for the $9 for 2 meal. I loved their in-house made hot sauce. Finally hot sauce with real flavor. Definitely going again!"
13491,Great place to take lunch or morning coffees to.
13492,Great place to shop
13493,Wish they would have never been purchased by Bass Pro but the staff is still awesome
13494,"So so so rapey! I dislike using that word, but that was the total vibe. Don't go their by yourself unless you are very confident you can intimidate surley old bush men@.@ they had a bar, no pool table last winter. Not sure now."
13495,Great place they got us sorted with our A class RV
13496,"Lovely place to see a show! They have multiple theaters, so don't be afraid to ask for directions!"
13497,My dog daughter and I go here regularly close to everyday
13498,"Taylored Restoration will give you an estimate and draw up an agreement only to Come back not only once, but twice after the project has started to make it ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù. Less expensive flooring in the situation I‚Äôm referring to, not only once but after the project was started came back a second time with an even cheaper option.

Taylored will ONLY out one coat of paint on your walls

Taylored will NOT do any matching for transition strips from vinyl flooring to next

Taylored WILL leave cabinets unfixed to walls an unleveled

Taylored says they will send a final cleaner, however none of the ceiling fans in house were cleaned, cobwebs in the corners of ceiling from dust collecting, not a single window cleaned, adhesives left to the flooring from when they covered them to protect them

Only came in 7 weeks behind schedule & hear nothing but complaining coming from project manager Brian. Throughout the project I was monitoring for out of state friends, Brian (the project manager) treated me like literal garbage, abusive language towards his staff and customers, has a superiority complex, sucks at customer service & could clearly care less above finishing project in a timely and professional manner. A complete jerk!

I hope everyone at Taylored has to deal with a project where someone like Brian is their contact so they can see the level of customer service they are allowing their brand to represent.

Needless to say, if you‚Äôre able, save yourself the headache and go with another company.

There was only a single person doing the majority of the installation work. Was expected to do sheet rock, paint, trim, plumbing, electricity.

Essential the house was left abc competed with the bare minimum to finish the project.

Kitchen sink was left not completely hooked up and has a leak."
13499,"Incredible customer service, food, music, beverages, and ambience. I love the quality of their food and drinks. Their caffe cups are cool too. I have never been disappointed since the five or more times I went to Ollin. I was just impressed and want to come back again. Their Tuesday tacos are as authentic as I've ever had. I highly recommend this place."
13500,Burgers never disappoint!
13501,"Great food, even better staff. You will not leave hungry.  Breakfast is awesome."
13502,"If you like history this Museum tells the history of Valdez before the US government Force the entire town to completely move to a new location
The museum has lots of miscellaneous items from the era, but is the dioramas in the glass cases showing the entire area before the move that are the highlight of this Museum.
Lots of detail, and a real nice reconstruction of how things used to be. The museum is the only way you'll see this as there's nothing left of the original Town whatsoever.
He only had 20 minutes to spend and needed more like an hour and a half at least.
This is one of those gems put up by locals that are the Highlight for people interested in history."
13503,Cleaner than most
13504,Great pit stop for bathroom and snacks on roadtrip thru Alaska.
13505,Crow's Nest's service is superb and drinks are decently priced.
13506,Best seafood place and great atmosphere.
13507,Waited an hour and a half before I finally left.
13508,"Spending a day at Chena Hot Springs was fun. We did the hot springs, an ice museum tour, and dinner before heading home. The hot springs were a fun experience for only $15. The ice museum tour didn‚Äôt seem like much of a tour, but the museum itself was neat, though much smaller than I had expected."
13509,"So hit and miss. Some nights it‚Äôs great, others it‚Äôs a huge miss. The lack of consistency in regards to the food, kills me. Service from the front desk and staff is sublime and has give this +1 star otherwise a clean 2/5. Just skip this one and mosey over to club Paris or bubbly mermaid."
13510,Great stylists and great customer service
13511,It was a nice recreational area for camping and fishing. Make sure you bring you cash because it is a recreational spot that charges even if you just parking. Some people park up the road before the toll shack but it's a bit if a walk if your that committed to not paying for parking. I didn't camp there but from what I could tell the RV spots looked nice. During tourist season if you dont mind casting elbow to elbow this might be the spot for you. I suggest getting a pair of chest waiters and getting to those prime locations you just cant get to otherwise.
13512,"Always a lovely stop at this place.
Some of my favorite beers and has a great local grapefruit soda.
Lovely view of the mountains from upstairs, with great local art decorating the place.
They also play local music through the speakers there.
If you're a fan of sours then you'd enjoy this stop.
Friendly and outgoing staff."
13513,Placed an order for drive up pickup. Arrived within the  appointed time slot. Received a call saying they were still shopping for orders for 2 hours ago so we would have to come back 2 hours later. Won't be shopping with them anymore. Going to use Safeway! This has happened to multiple people.
13514,Pretty
13515,I am always a fan when I come here! The food is wonderful and creative! It's expensive but worth every penny! I normally get the baked Mac and cheese and it is so good!! And the staff are all so friendly!
13516,Love their mango salad dressing!!!!
13517,The decor and food are amazing and the view of the mountain is breathtaking i highly suggest visiting this place
13518,"Very good, prices are reasonable."
13519,"Great food, service, & atmosphere"
13520,"Best bacon cheeseburger and fries that I've had in Alaska.  The burger was HUGE and made to order.  The fries were a generous portion and delicious. Quite pricey for the burger and fries, but it definitely was TWO meals worth of food, so well worth the price. Is my go-to for burgers and fries for sure!"
13521,"Knowledgeable, accommodating techs in a large space. They make sure that they make you feel like the most important client every time you visit."
13522,The ballet was terrific. Difficult to get served during intermission; the theater was too warm.
13523,Good prices nice people and service. Standard American food.
13524,All was excellent for us save for the burger.  It was meh.  But everything else was great!  Will feast there again
13525,Alaska Land
13526,"Tried to get a taxi 4 days ago we were stranded miles out of town, the temperature was -22 Fahrenheit, we called and called, nobody answered. We died in our sleep. Thanks king cab. Thanks"
13527,Great Burgers and the service was great too.
13528,Good food
13529,They always manage to have what I need when I need it
13530,Always clean and the food has always been hot.  Friendly staff.
13531,"Service is great, the menu is okay. Needs a bit of tune up, the view is great and the place is well kept. Prices are fairly good, above all the crab and brie dip is what makes the visit worth it."
13532,"Great pizza.
Great customer service."
13533,"Got into one of the new cabins, was a great night's stay, very clean and comfortable. Classic lodge decor, which fits the area and motif. Was located directly off the main highway with ample parking."
13534,#7 burger delicious
13535,Great place to grab some authentic Mexican food.
13536,Nice outdoor beer garden.
13537,Awesome customer service and quality of the products.üíØ‚ô•Ô∏è
13538,Not empress with food at all. Breakfast was horrible and way over priced
13539,"They dont take reservations so plan your trip, generous portions, Alaskan King Crab, Jambalaya, Steak all cooked to perfection."
13540,Has a good cafeteria and coffee shop
13541,"Great place. Impressive beer. The prices are a little high, though."
13542,This is a second time I am renting a car within a last two months. The car is not ready for me to pick it up.
13543,It's a full service Chevron station
13544,Very good pizza
13545,Some of the best burgers I've had for a decent price.
13546,"Mann Leiser is an amazing greenhouse with such a wide variety of interesting and unusual plants. I've taken my kids here for years,  they love looking around and seeing what's in bloom. It's a great place in the winter when you need to see some green."
13547,Locals favorite!
13548,"They usually have what I'm looking for, the prices are good, and the employees are nice. I had one bad experience with a teller being rude to my wife but that was years ago and I think she's gone now!"
13549,"Good service, good food, and good ice cream."
13550,"I gotta say this is a amazing restaurant that I have been to time and time again since they opened. Clean, fast, accurate and delicious are just a few ways to explain this place, as if they needed another reason for praise they even donate to the local fire department."
13551,"How can you have a Country Backyard Bar-BQ and not have a single bar-bq vendor? Ken Peltier was okay... 6 live songs over one hour forty five minutes with at least 20 recorded/radio songs at low volume. Seemed like the real attraction was the free beer for the alcoholic family crowd. The headliner band might have done well though at 50¬∞f with rain and 10 mph winds alternating a simple blanket and chair was not enough to keep me around for this let down of a show. P.S. There was some real entertainment value in listening to the intoxicated local fishing guides bad mouthing their employees, co-workers and ""dumbass clients""."
13552,Great service and the baristas pretty much pull the best shot in all of Anchorage. Worth skipping the drive throughs and sometumes ling lines.
13553,"I always enjoy my time spent shopping here. The owner is a very nice lady, who has  many beautiful beads of all kinds. If you have any questions, all you have to do is ask. She's quite delightful to talk to."
13554,Love this place. Friendly and knowledgeable every time.
13555,Usually great service e but long wait today
13556,Always a great experience here
13557,"Open till 10, clean and friendly staff and store."
13558,Awesome customer service great people and amazing coffe exactly how I like it. Amazing hand made sandwiches!!
13559,They are very clean and tidy.  They service is kind and helpful.
13560,"Pretty small, as Subways usually are, but staff is nice and helpful."
13561,This staff is unlike any other in Anchorage! They're passion shines from they're friendly approach all the way to your plate!   I wish I could've brought this place home with me!! Great experience time after time!
13562,Great fancy and everyday eating.
13563,Same as ever
13564,Food was OK. Service not great for number of customers there.
13565,Moose
13566,"I love this place! I got a pizza and it was so delicious. My babies shared the pasta and meatballs. My older boy devoured it! He is so so so picky but he loved it! He couldn't eat it fast enough. I was impressed.
Their customer service is very good too!"
13567,Go team go it little worn but still serves it's purpose
13568,Local dive for sports and cheap drinks
13569,Nice views of Denali.
13570,"Staff was amazing and wonderful. Very humble, friendly and courteous. We started with ATV ride which was fun itself. Then we reached to ziplining location which took us around 10 mins ATV ride away from the highway into woods. Ziplining was well organized, total 8 ziplines are there. You climb one by one, which is not challenging. Good place for kids though. One thing we did not like is pictures that they took are very expensive.  It should be free or cheap as we are already paying for the ziplining. If photos were not the issue, we would have given 4 stars."
13571,Food tasted great!
13572,Service was great. I only had the wings and they were good... Though very Expensive at 16.50 a dozen... 3 draft Beers were good. The peanut farm is a good place to go an see a sporting event. After 20 percent gratuity.. $42 hummm.... Since when did some beer and wings cost $42? Is give 3.5 stars if I could.
13573,Really good drinks
13574,"I would choose Lowes over HomeDepot any day even with prices a tad bit higher for certain items. The employees are actually very helpful and attentive. Seems like a good environment to be in. Whenever I needed help there was someone available.
Plus: as I am building at the moment I can saw that the quality of the wood products they sell is absolutely worth the bit more when it comes to $."
13575,Awesome pizza
13576,Not great
13577,It's Cabela's.
13578,Good service excellent staff well worth it.
13579,Fast serving and great food. If you want the best quality sushi this is the place for it. Their chief is the best cooked!
13580,Very nice
13581,"""These fries are so crunchy."" - My daughter
""This omelette is so yummy."" - Me"
13582,"Heads up the sushi is made and then just left on a shelf non-refrigerated hope you get it fresh. Enjoy playing sushi roulette.
Thankfully there is Pho Vatsana, not as trendy but way better, larger servings and consistency.
Gino you can't keep blaming your employees for not showing them right. Having them leave sushi non-refrigerated to sit out and wait till someone orders is on no one else fault besides you Gino."
13583,Okay flavor.
13584,Quick service for your gasoline needs
13585,"Waiting ,üì≤"
13586,Great place! A must see near Anchorage. You can observe lots of wild animals including bears in the park. I really love it!
13587,"Food was good, view amazing. Sit in the restaurant. Christian was our server and he was great! Super helpful, friendly, answered questions. Also, we were probably the last table of the night sat less than 15 minutes to close and he seemed happy we were there and that he could serve us.

If we were sat immediately in the bar and just met Christian the would be more than a 5 star review. However, we went to the bar first waiting on a table. The bartender seemed uninterested in having more people to help claiming that several seats at the bar were taken by patrons that were outside smoking. Other customers got up while we waited for seats and sat next to these empty seats. Multiple times people tried to sit in these empty bar seats and were greeted with an abrasive bartender asking,  ""Do you plan on staying here?"" Then after someone's reply she would say there are people sitting here but they are outside smoking. There was two water glasses in those seats that looked like dirty dishes as they were sweating from the completely melted ice that once was in the glass. We sat at the bar for about an hour, I think the hostess forgot we were waiting on a table but that was ok cause a patron sitting next to us was great conversation. If the bartender was our experience here this would be a 2 star review with only the view making up for the stars. Sit in the restaurant. You will get great service and a wo derful view sans attitude from the bartender who doesn't want to tend bar...."
13588,Was good they forgot a burito though!
13589,Always clean and the people are nice.  The french fries are always hot.
13590,I gave it a 5/5 because I'm comparing it to other local McDonald's. Good service and quality.
13591,"I have a corn allergy and they have pies I can eat.
Everyone in there is friendly and if you do not want to eat alone they will include you in their conversations."
13592,"Fun place either hitting the lifts, touring up the mountain for some spectacular views or doing some tubing. Good setup here!"
13593,Helpful staff this visit.
13594,One of the best restaurants in Seward! The service is great and the menu(which always has new specials) is so well balanced and reasonably priced for the quality. Always great going out to eat here.
13595,Best ALL AMERICAN CHEESEBURGER & steak fries I've had in a long time.
13596,Cool little sportsmans shop with friendly people
13597,"the male host was very kind and they're food is good. convenient for pickup during covid. it's the pricey Mexican food , my husband and I and toddler was over $50.

üëåüåÆüåØüçΩ"
13598,I love the the gear for law enforcement being that I'm in the security field I can find many items for my job. Very pricey if you're on a budget
13599,Clean. Very expensive!
13600,Very Helpful and lots of intonation
13601,"Love Costco, just wish there was one in palmer."
13602,"Great customer service, knowledgeable staff and wonderful food. Dining at Bobby's is always a pleasure!"
13603,"All my craft needs in one store, how cool is that?"
13604,"So the hours say available until 11pm. However I got there at 10:05  on 12-11-2020 and found the entrance to be blocked off by a truck. There were people in the line, so I was a bit confused to say the least. Well, I went in through the exit and looped around, then waited in line for 40 minutes to order a drink.

We don't have a Sonic in Anchorage where I am from and I just wanted a diet Dr. Pepper with a shot of vanilla and a banana split for my wife. Well, we finally got to order and the employee demanded, in a very rude tone I might add "" How did you get in here?"" I replied that the entrance had been blocked off by a truck, which didn't make any sense to me since they closed at 11pm so I came through the exit. The employee then replied that they stop letting people in to the drive through at 10pm. this was pretty shocking to me, as it is a whole hour before closing.

When I asked why they stopped letting people in at 10 she replied that it was to clean the fryers.

I have no idea who in management came up with the idea to have  place listed as open until 11pm when they stop taking customers after 10pm. If your hours of operation are until 11pm, you should be able to take customers up until that point. If you want to clean the fryers at 10pm, then maybe switch your hours to close at 10pm.

Or at the very least maybe have a sign saying you do not accept anyone after 10pm?

Or I don't know, change your hours to close at 10pm and then stop taking customers at that time?"
13605,Great but I broke my arm on the Wipeout machine
13606,"This is a popular spot for locals for lunch. Service falls short when the place is busy. The food is nothing to look forward to, I can't understand what the attraction is."
13607,"My friend & I went in late one evening to try something new. She had never had Indian food and I haven't had any since I was about 4 or 5 years old. We ate way too much, between the Masala Fries (addictive & I absolutely loved the tamarind sauce!), Dal Shorba soup (didn't eat much of that one, seemed bland after the fries) & our entr√©es Chicken Korma & Chicken Tikka Masala. Both Korma & Tikka Masala tasted absolutely amazing my taste buds were in heaven & the Chicken was perfect, moist with a tender buttery texture. We stuffed ourselves and still had a bunch of leftovers to take home for later. Our server, Kayla, was super sweet & helpful

The one thing I was disappointed I didn't see on the menu was a food that my sitter/nanny used to make for me when I was little and that was a Yellow Rice dish that she sometimes put tomatoes in. I have no clue what it was called but I seem to recall it was a simple dish. But that's a me thing."

The size of the restaurant could be larger internally so more people could enjoy the great service and food but regardless if you decide to eat in or out the staff make you feel welcome.  I would have to say that the size, taste, and apperance of their hamburgers is by far one of if not the best in Fairbanks.  They have an incentive program for continued patronage and even after only two visits I 40% complete in earning a free meal."

He checked on it several times but apparently they don't pay this gentleman any mind for whatever reason. What that means at the end of the day is the customer doesn't get his or her food on time. I finally asked for my money back and the lady at the counter was unapologetic, with a tinge of attitude as if its my fault it takes them 40 minutes to cook chicken. I guess I should have cleared my wife and I's schedule for this taco cause Xalos takes over 40 minutes to cook chicken. Bad management, and terrible customer service from the register. Not worth your time."

13762,"If you have bad credit and need a car, big state will work with you. With that being said, here is the good and bad

Good: They are pretty good about working with you provided you pay your bills and don't give them a hard time. The owner of the lot owns the shop across the street, and is capable of getting things fixed quickly.

Bad: My family and I have gotten three vehicles from this lot, and it's apparent that whoever conducts the vehicle inspections is cutting corners. All 3 vehicles had failed valve cover gaskets which leaked slot of oil into the spark plug wells. 2 out of 3 had failed ABS systems, and all three needed spark plugs changed due to improper gap.

In spite of the bad, the people who run it seem like good people. I would still recommend buying from here if your credit is hurting, but bring a mechanically inclined friend along to double check their work."

13764,"I have shopped with Duluth Trading before they had open their 1st brick a mortar store. So was so happy to hear they opened one in Anchorage so while in the area today I went to check it out. My rating is not reflected on the products or staff but by how they are screwing people on pricing. Everything I ordered came to $116.90 to come home and find out everything should have been on sale. Every single item was suppose to be on sale from the shirts to the soaps to the socks I got with a difference of $18.58, so no telling how many people have paid more then they should have... We called the store back and they stated to bring in the receipt and what info from the website says and they will take care of it... We also called corporate and the customer service had closed already bit the women stated no matter how you buy threw Duluth website or store front the prices are the same. So if you've been there the past few days check your receipt compared to online and see how much your owed..."

13768,Good burgers just takes a while for them to get out to you.
13769,Fun times!
13770,It's ok. They have free lift tickets on Thursday nights for military but honestly I don't think it's worth the drive. Normal prices are pretty expensive for what it is. Lots of traffic along the way. You might as well just go to Aleyeska if you're going this far. Or Arctic valley if it's open
13771,"Interesting to see how other rate a used car sales place as five stars or ""top notch"".  I guess I have a slightly different view.   First off, yes, their sales pitch is pretty easy and alluring: a hands-off, no pressure approach.  You cansign out cars to test drive..  You can walk on the lot and not a single salesperson will bother you.  And yes, buying the car itself is easy.  However, no matter how you look at it, you're not getting a good deal.  All of the sales tactics are easy when you're in Fairbanks.  The competition  is pretty limited, and any of the new car dealers in town make it easy to come to a place like this.  They promote a no haggle price, and sadly most people fall for it.  Check it out people: you're supposed to negotiate the deal.  However, again, because it's Fairbanks, the upper hand lies with them.  Here's what I say.  Do your research on the vehicle you need.  Shop across the state, including Anchorage.  And do not put yourself in a position where you desperately need a car.  You will get screwed.  They'll also tell you that they charge a $250 fee for registering a vehicle and make it seem like its convienent for you, but be aware.  You're getting robbed.  Titling a vehicle in Alaska costs $15 and registration is $100 for two years.  So it's hard to say that the extra $135 is worth the 20 minutes in DMV.  Yes, DMV in Fairbanks  is pretty efficient plus they serve a very small population. For registration you're never in there that long.  So, don't get stuck having to buy a car, plan that purchase well in advance.  DO negotiate the price with them.  Get your own financing, you'll get a better rate at the bank or credit union, and don't let them tell you that their registration fees are saving you time.  All it does is make them more money.  Yes, the sales guys are nice and helpful.  But that's how you make money.  Are they better than the Chevy dealer?  I'd say so.  But the bottom line is they do massive monthly turnover so they're making a nice percentage off the public.  Good luck."
13772,Excellent!
13773,It is Joann's y'all. Expect to get lost for days with the plethora of crafting supplies you didn't even know existed that you now can't live without. For example miniature clothes pins the size of a quarter... They are on the end of the nugget Mall.

You have no idea how many cofee stands I have searched for real smoothies, only to find they use nasty concentrate junk. South is the real deal.  The only downside is the cafe can get crowded, we were (very politely) jumped by several standing customers as soon as we relinquished our seat."

13795,"Bear Tooth Theatrepub is my favorite place to see ""just off first run"" movies... or any movie for that matter.

The non-reserved ticket price is 4$ (Jan. 2019) & the theater seating has tables for food & beverages (alcohol too). There is also balcony seating (my favorite).

Ordered food from the concession stand / restaurant is delivered to your seated location, marked by numbered orange cones, obtained when ordering.

There are spotters in the theater to direct waitstaff to your location.

There is a plethora of food options, along with typical movie theater fare... AND the prices are reasonable when compared to major theater concession costs.

Only one theater exists, so the rotation of films throughout the day (up to four movies per day) and week are published online.

The staff are always kind, helpful, and efficient.

I cherish my time spent here."

13814,"My daughter brought her little puppy here to have him neutered and they were great, very nice people and treated wylee great too. They charged me less then quoted and that is so amazing and I respect them for that. I would definitely use them again. Thank you and I'm glad I found your clinic."
13815,"If I could give less than 1 star I would. I ordered a chicken-fried steak and eggs. The eggs were extremely overdone, almost burned, the hash browns were very dry and gross, the chicken-fried steak was a weird purple color on the inside and tasted very off. My grandma got pancakes and she said that they were gross too.
We complained to the manager and all she said was sorry and asked why we didnt tell our server. The server only came by once then avoided our table.
Not only was the food inedible, but it took abouy 30 minutes to get our food when there were only 4 other people in the restaraunt and they already had their food when we sat down.
I try not to complain at restaraunts but beef shouldn't be purple!! I was hoping she would comp it since it was inedible and I only took 2 bites but she charged full price. Never going back to a village inn again."
13816,Great food and views
13817,Where I live south of downtown I did not get good service....but they did a good job of never keeping me waiting long.

13820,Yes

13823,A little over priced of course they do all the work of getting Costco to Wasilla as much as they can. Good quality though.

13842,Fast friendly service
13843,Sound quality at the Borealis Theatre was horrendous for the Shinedown concert and it took an hour and 10 minutes to get out of the parking lot due to the incompetence of the staff.
13844,Awesome food and service!
13845,Nice ... serene
13846,"LOTS of clam strips in an appetizer serving, but that appetizer is $11. And I feel it's one of those bags of frozen clam strips they deep fry. Still, good.

The fish and chips are excellent. My 4 year old ate it up."
13847,The worst customer service ever! They need employees with better attitudes
13848,Service was good. Steaks were tough.
13849,"I LOVE Buckos Coffee!!! Best stand in Fairbanks and North Pole combined!! The 6 Shooter is my favorite.  Not too sweet, the right balance of bitter and sweet....YUMMMM!!!"
13850,Ok BBQ but about the best your gonna get in Anchorage that I have seen.
13851,I love sunsation SO MUCH. I love Tikahtnu and Eagle River sunsation!! It‚Äôs so clean and inviting. I‚Äôve been to other places to tan (like the Alaska club) and sunsation it‚Äôs 10 million times better. I swear their beds are the best!
13852,Nice and friendly service.
13853,"Food came a little cold, delivery was fast, fries tasted like they were fried in some type of seafood oil like they didn‚Äôt change the oil or something but they were perfectly crispy and the Mac salad wasn‚Äôt mixed well. Overall it could have been better."
13854,Looking good
13855,If you're looking for some great food with fresh ingredients this is the place.  And the price is right. Wow just found out about their TACO TUESDAY! tacos are only 1.99 that's a smoking deal for some amazing tacos. Don't miss out on this gem of a location.
13856,Love the shopping and food üòé
13857,Underblaster sucked and the air dryer sucked
13858,"EXTREMELY CLEAN!!  That was my first impression. Especially when you think of your typical small town eating establishment. After that, it was an acceleration toward a exceptional  experience. Mind you this is the ""off season"", and bias is always on the side of the locals I am sure.
This place is run by a wife and husband team. The husband being a retired commercial airline pilot with over 30k hours of flight experience all over the world. This is an important fact, because airline pilots are a very meticulous breed; paying attention to every detail is a must.  Quality is of the highest priority and it shows! The wife is native to Thailand and not just that, but having been in the restaurant business in her homeland. Authenticity and originality are the theme and fort√© you are rewarded with here.
Here we were greeted with warmth (temperatures were sub zero at the time), kindness, and a friendly smile. Appetizers were fantastic too, while waiting for the main course to be delivered in a timely fashion. You are able to personalize anything on the menu, excepting the Larb and one other menu item I can't recall. You can request any degree of spiciness you desire, which is typical.
This place is a must visit ASAP , as the owners are planning to retire to Thailand within a 3 year period at this time. Hopefully it can stay open under equally qualified management in the future.
May good luck and fortune smile upon you and your visit, as it did upon ours"
13859,My wife and I love this place. Nice and cozy and very reasonable prices. Food quality is amazing and the staff are on top of everything. Also the food was out to our table in very short time.
13860,Decent BBQ at a reasonable price
13861,"One of my favorite places to eat in town. Best Mexican food and even their burger is really good! Salsa bar is always great. I always get white queso dip, my other favorites are the Cabo salad and the pineapple marinated pork burritos or quesadilla. So many great choices it's hard to pick!"
13862,I love the food. The wings are amazing and the portion sizes are super fair. Even with how busy it is the staff is pretty attentative. 10/10 recommend
13863,Good food need to get more
13864,Awesome
13865,Definitely the best for the money also a cool hot tub
13866,Great family restaurant
13867,Took me a while to find things.  Everything has been moved. After having to hunt down what you want isn't all good. After years and years of having everything in it's proper place.
13868,Nuggets ruin lives.
13869,Just about everything you need.
13870,"Parking lot is large, fenced area is decent sized. There are doggy bags on site for cleaning up after your pet."
13871,"Got our nursery set from here, shipped right to our door!  We haven't had any problems with it (bought in 2012)"

13885,"Great place to study, go for a date or just hang out with free wifi. Hope you enjoy this place as much as I."
13886,i saw a eagle
13887,"Way way overpriced the taste was nice but it was mostly bread, on the Italian no sub sauce as dry as a bone. 6 dollars for a small soup again it was good but over 40 for lunch that we needed to eat again in a couple hours is ridiculous we will never eat there again"
13888,Helpful staff & fast service.
13889,Scummy
13890,Friendly and nice store
13891,It is just a daylodge.  But a fun hive of activity in the winter with all the skiers.  And the lovely Java Haus coffee shop
13892,"Youngs gear is a very professional place in my 1 experience with them.  I own a foreign truck and needed my driveline balanced. (Long story short it's a tough task)  I didn't know the first thing about how they go about it, so they took the time to explain the how's and why's and gave me an estimate that they stood by.  I now know alot more about my driveline.  Their price point was on par.  I give them 2 thumbs up!"
13893,Loved it
13894,Has a good cafeteria and coffee shop
13895,The best place to mountain bike in the valley with increasingly more trails being added
13896,It is Joann's y'all. Expect to get lost for days with the plethora of crafting supplies you didn't even know existed that you now can't live without. For example miniature clothes pins the size of a quarter... They are on the end of the nugget Mall.
13897,Good food good atmosphere
13898,"Cool place, strange blend of options that make it fun. It was clearly a popular spot, and I will be going back again for a boba tea. I got the sesame chicken, and it was pretty good. First time I've ever gotten enough rice for the amount of chicken. The rice was nice a sticky, my husband got the fried rice and said it good but he wished his rice was stickier."
13899,Good salads
13900,Pizza was just how I ordered & they had to go cups to use with the 1 liter soda for our picnic.
13901,"Friendly and clean, variety of vegetarian options"
13902,"Meh, It's Arby's, it gets a lot of turn over employee wise, plus this location gets a good share of homeless and otherwise questionable folks swinging in, but it also gets its share of families with small children, overall it's not too bad of place."
13903,Coleslaw was home made(not Sysco). Brisket sandwich was delicious. And the cornbread was hot. Great service!
13904,Great booze. And Awesomr food.
13905,Very clean and friendly people good movies
13906,My pediatrician moved to the building
13907,"Great food,  great wine and great service!"
13908,On time with quality work.  Willing to fix non-accident related damage at a discounted rate while the vehicle was in the shop.  The vehicle was nicely cleaned inside and out as an added bonus.  My visit was coordinated through an insurance claim and that process was flawless.  Able coordinated the rental car and all I had to do was trade keys with the service rep on drop-off.  Awesome!
13909,Usual...
13910,Small place lots of guns but prices are to high
13911,The doctors and everyone here is wonderful. I would highly recommend them. The Wasilla location is open from 12 pm to 6 pm.  They have a really nice waiting room and its conveniently located in Wasilla .
13912,"Great store..all around.  Need more dish selections.  Cashiers need to calm down about memberships and policies. One membership...should cover family household.  Also, I understand giving people jobs but what is the purpose of showing your membership right at the door.  Also, loss in food court profit due to having to have membership to get food.   High schoolers can't go and have a cheap lunch."
13913,"I had high hopes for this restaurant. The wait staff has been slow and inattentive both times I've visited and had bad attitudes. I first went for dinner and the last time I went for brunch.
The cioppino was overly spicy. The crab cakes were full of filler and over priced. The only redeeming thing at Everett's is their seafood chowder.
For brunch I had the prime rib sandwich. The sandwich was on a overly saturated bun that fell apart and the meat was full of fat. I took a few bites before deciding this was better suited to be dog food. At least they had the courtesy of taking the sandwich off my bill.
I don't think we will be returning until they have an over haul of their chef and menu.

Edit: For Tyler H. who I can only assume is associated with the restaurant. I am sure that of all your restaurant patrons love being called a child.
It wasn't just me who noticed that the prime rib sandwich was overly fatty, your waitress Ame noticed this as well.. I have had cioppino at many places but yours is just too spicy."
13914,Best doughnuts in AK.
13915,Olive garden is always a good place to fill uo on all your favorite Italian foods. Fast service great atmosphere.
13916,Downtown baby
13917,Careful don't fat yourself
13918,"Fred Meyer is a one-stop shop.  Everything from prepared food to groceries to to sporting goods, clothing, household and garden, you name it.  I love their selection, I don't have to drive all over town, and the price is right.  How can you go wrong?"
13919,"Great place for family. My boyfriend's son is a 22 year old Down syndrome for Special Olympics, and he's been there every year for the last 11 years. I enjoy it. And I love the people that work there."
13920,Lovely!
13921,"Not to bad, have had much worse and much better, could be cheaper but still not to bad, kinda a let down on menu selection and Sake wasnt the best ether but overall worth the visit"
13922,This place is so over priced! I think it's pathetic what they charge for second hand stuff. This store is a joke.
13923,It's a hole
13924,Great looked online found what we wanted went there found it immediately and was able to get out the door quick

13940,Terrific place to get cute scrubs!
13941,I love this Carrs!
13942,Great beer and food with excellent service!
13943,"Mixed results from all the visits to this location. For the most part, it is a normal Carl's Jr. experience, however sometimes it is slow, rude, and the food is horrible.

Best deal at this location is the $5 real deal. One burger, one chicken burger, fries and a drink. Best calories to cost ratio."
13944,Good hike. Great scenery.
13945,Nice place quiet and relaxed
13946,"Nice, but gone now."
13947,It was ok but the workers play there and they always seem to win.
13948,Awesome hike
13949,It is a good cheap alternative to KFC.
13950,The sidewalk was not cleared in February bit I was still able to access the arch. Pretty neat looking and a great place for a photo op.
13951,"Not bad,  they're very popular day and night!"
13952,Always wonderful. Amazing desserts
13953,"Ordered online, they forgot my dessert!"
13954,Everything I need for everyday life... good prices & they treat each other and customers with respect.
13955,Cozy atmosphere
13956,"Locally owned outdoor sports outfitter manned by Alaskans who actually hike, hunt,  climb, ski, board and etc.  If you need gear this is a great place."
13957,Keep in mind that this is one place you can deliver a US flag for proper disposal.
13958,Nice to have them here.
13959,Absolute fun for the kids and adults...
13960,Fast check out good selection

13969,Gorgeous!
13970,So much easier and less stressful than Fred Meyers or Wal Mart.
13971,Salmon overcooked
13972,"Great staff, amazing food"
13973,"The orders have to be checked for accuracy, and wait times can be a real pain,. However, Sehja Pedro is always nice, and can cheer our child up if waits occur."
13974,"Good Italian, steak and seafood."
13975,"Very Friendly, welcoming and warm."
13976,Food is good but restaurant is frequently smoke filled due to poor ventilation in the kitchen. It bothers be enough to opt for takeout if I ever order from there again.
13977,"The pizza is excellent but expect a wait. They have popcorn, live music on Tuesdays, and a bar."
13978,Long line long wait friendly staff but I had a custom order and after all that waiting it was wrong could just have been an off day for them but I give this store 3*
13979,"Nice little surprise in my trip through glenallen.  I hope you don't get the waitress that does not know what ""may I have a glass of water, please"" means.

The breakfast was bomb"
13980,"Had the king crab, chowder and beers."
13981,You will need a car to get out there and spend time wandering around.
13982,Best deals
13983,"Dr Manion is amazing.  His staff worked with me and were very welcoming and informative.  I was told i would have no chance of repair and other surgeons just wanted to cut out my meniscus. Dr Manion busted his butt to make sure he gave my knee the opportunity to be repaired instead of just cutting out the majority of my meniscus.  Other doctors said it wasn't worth trying to repair and just to cut the torn portions out, which would lead to more surgeries later and a full knee replacement.  I cant thank Dr Manion and his staff enough."
13984,Quick and easy .price seems ok
13985,A lot of tools
13986,"Very cool ride up and great view at the top. Not much to do once you get there, but still loved it. Not sure the cost since it was included in our tour."
13987,"I would have been satisfied with chocolate and vanilla. This place has really fantastic flavors!
I'm screwed for keto alignment, and they're all over the valley, so I cant get away from them. What a great summer. They should will power to the menu so I can just get that."
13988,"Love how I can buy pizza by the slice from 11am -4pm at an affordable price, always fresh too."

13990,"I can't resist their chai.

Food is always good."
13991,Selection on some toys not good
13992,"Pretty darn fun, not a bad price especially between 2 and 5.  There were a few broken machines, only complaint."
13993,"Always great; the atmosphere, the workers and the flavors!"
13994,Always make me the Best Americano and have a zucchini muffin can't beat it!
13995,Enjoyed the food and drink but can have spotty customer service. Though that's also most of Fairbanks :P Love the Fajitas here though :)
13996,Great selection at a wide range of prices. Great to catch them during a sale.
13997,"(Translated by Google) A nice place to rest and watch, compared to the rest of the city. From here you can almost walk around the corner to the Eismeum, where every hour a film, the ice sculptures and a demonstration are shown. Admission to the ice museum is $ 15.

14008,I use it almost every day.. as I'm a Lyft driver
14009,They have not had a good selection of Lifeline phones
14010,"Friendly folks , a pleasure to do buisness !"
14011,The food was a good portion but was disappointed with the chili which seemed to lack any seasoning in it.
14012,Great staff and great food!
14013,I really don't understand why there are so many good reviews. This place has one of the worst burritos I've ever eaten.  Steak was  very tough and not cut into proper pieces for a burrito. Only gave two stars because there was a massive amount of cheese in it and the lady at the window delivered stellar customer service. Will not eat here again though.
14014,"(Translated by Google) Typical not to be missed

Typique √† ne pas manquer"
14015,Great place to do your laundry very clean and super nice people
14016,Food is good the workers idk need better p
14017,"I go here to get My women‚Äôs Carhart pants. Everything else is pricey, name brand but really nice stuff."
14018,A very nice building and amazingly friendly and knowledgeable staff.  A popular spot for tourists in the Homer area.  Some of everything in there. A Great historic wood cabin that is furnished with past relics.
14019,"It's a Walmart, pretty much the same everywhere."
14020,"It took me a long time to find a trusty mechanic shop in Anchorage. Nathan and the rest of the staff always take time to listen and fix my vehicle in a timely manner. Most if not all of the work has a warranty. They are reasonably priced and  what is really impressive is I almost always get my vehicle back the same day. I am very happy to have finally made Midas my shop of choice after dealing with other mechanics taking days to fix small problems, overcharging, and have rude people working phones and the counter. They have a whole team and many bay doors to get your car or truck in and out back on the road. As a lifelong Alaskan they have my families buisness whenever I need to bring in the rig. Thanks Midas I appreciate you always going above and beyond."
14021,Good comfort food.
14022,Cool place
14023,Classic gun shop
14024,Decent prices good selection.
14025,This is a great burger place! Their brisket is sooo good! You‚Äôll love it! Best burger place in town! üòä

14027,Very nice and knowledgeable.
14028,Best high end dining in Fairbanks. Never disappointed and the staff are some of the absolute best. So many drink and wine options
14029,Good food
14030,"I went in Saturday  2/10/18 and ordered my normal of biscuits and gravy and hash browns. I ate half and the food and service was great. I took the other half home. Today 2/12/18 I went to eat the other same half of the biscuits and gravy. My first bite into it I found a large piece of plastic inside the biscuit! Not in the gravy IN the biscuits. This has never been a issue before. I called the resteraunt to let them know. After I explained what had happened I was given ""Do you want a replacement or what?"" No thank you. An apology would have been appreciated. Hope this resteraunt improves, I won't be coming back."
14031,Fantastic staff at this location. Mark in appliances was super helpful and answered our half a million questions. Jim in blinds helped us select some awesome cellular shades at half the cost of Costco. Everyone was very knowledgeable and really wanted to help us. We will do all our business at this location.
14032,I am only giving this place 2 stars because of the beer and the view. When we first arrived nobody acknowledged us so we sat ourselves only to find out that we couldn‚Äôt sit where we were seated. We moved and couldn‚Äôt get any staff to acknowledge us again. We were only there to order drinks and I totally understand that they were busy. Multiple staff member walked by our table and still nothing. Finally my friend got up to get a server and someone took our order and then we never seen them again. We ordered for the second time and it took far too long to get our drinks. We asked for our bill when we got the drinks because we didn‚Äôt know when we would see another staff member. There was staff everywhere but for some reason we were invisible. Stay away from this place is you want a drink in less than an hour.
14033,Cuz it's kewl
14034,Slow/almost non-existent service. Chips were good though. Server seems to be doing nothing a lot of the time and walked past us when we needed service.
14035,"This is a Target. It's is clean, stocked, and in a nice neighborhood."
14036,The best views. Good enough bar food. Good bathroom.
14037,Unless with no stock
14038,"We ate here a couple of times, it was very good. Lots of unique choices on the menu."
14039,"Independence Mine is a very interesting part of US and Alaska history.  The mine site is an easy hike with both a paved trail, a gravel trail, and many well worn trails.  Strollers, and wheelchairs are ok to take on he paved trail but you will be pushing good at several places.  The surrounding area has many more trails for great hiking of various difficulty.  It is also a great spot in the winter for snowmobiling and cross country skiing."
14040,Patient and fast even with wigglers.
14041,Had a rental car with an insurance claim.  Reservation was made and they called me at 0750 in the morning confirming my appointment.  Kaitlyn told me that all I need to do is call their number and they‚Äôll pick me up at the collision center after dropping my car off in 5 to 7 minutes.  I called immediately when I arrived at the collision place but was on hold total for over 20 minutes and the moment that she answered the call she just said they‚Äôre busy and hung up.  Twice.  Rude.  I always use enterprise when I travel because of the superior customer service but not here in Anchorage.  So unprofessional.
14042,Cool place
14043,Basic gas station
14044,Fast service
14045,"What a wonderful project of passion. Some of the most delicious food in Alaska. Beautiful atmosphere. Many delicious alternative choices, vegan, gluten free, HEALTHY. Highly recommended. Try the golden milk, I suggest alternative milk too!"

14055,The young man that works there is awesome.
14056,Elaina was very helpful in helping us choose furniture for our new home. We cane in loiking for a coffee table and left with a whole living room and dining room.

14065,"They've got a pretty well priced selection in the growler bar and I can't ever resist those pre-made deli things in the back. I used to hit this place up all the time when I lived nearby. Get faded, walk to 3 Bears. Awesome."
14066,Not to bad
14067,Typical for McDonald's
14068,"Now the Viking is the place to be if you wanna play pool wanna dance or just talk story, the service was quick and the drinks were superb.. If you like to sing and have a pleasant evening of dancing singing and socializing. Recommend the Viking.."

14074,Enterprise is the best car rental place.
14075,"Nice variety,  spendy, BUT, local business to support!"
14076,Great food and drinks. We sat outside at the rooftop dining area. They even had loaner blankets as the evening cooled off.
14077,Burger was extremely soggy the meat Patty was burnt ordered the sesame chicken spicy and most of the chicken pieces were Raw!! And I actually mean pink and rubbery in the middle. Ask for my money back and they said I took too long getting back to them. Basically because I was busy cooking my child something without salmonella. Paid $30 for poison couldn't get my money back
14078,Waited over 45 minutes for an order that got missed and wouldn't have known if I hadn't called this happens alot this needs to be addressed!!!!!!
14079,Great views. Can be a bit overrun with kids on weekends.
14080,I give you five stars because I've been going there ever since they've opened enjoy the Proprietors and their food is excellent
14081,"Locally owned hardware store in Eagle River. They carry a variety of things among paint, tools and Black Rifle coffee! Owners are great people who will go above and beyond to help you find what you need. What's not to like üòâ"
14082,Love the food. Great views if you have a clear day.
14083,Good deals
14084,"The best chocolate in Anchorage. Forget Modern Dwellers and find this place near Dimond Mall.  Free samples and in-depth explanations of their products and processes.  There's also a shop at the Captain Cook hotel, I understand.  Just go, with no regrets."
14085,Good comfort food.
14086,Great food
14087,It's Taco Bell. I didn't have great expectations to begin with.
14088,Good food and a busy brunch crowd made this a fun place to have some tasty eats. Portions were large and food was comfort style. An Anchorage institution.
14089,"Cozy an inviting! If you like your coffee strong, this is a good spot to stop by."
14090,"Good experience with hot food, fast service."
14091,Great place for aqua therapy.
14092,We love to come here for creamy treats. The ice cream is always tasty. We love the cakes. The service is average depending on how long the line is and the person helping you. To be expected with younger adults working the counter. Not as enthusiastic about singing for tips like they used to tho.
14093,Friendly and helpful workers!
14094,"Nice waterfall to cool off in and great hike options with terrific views. Great place to watch the Bore Tide and look for belugas in May, August & September"

14098,"(Translated by Google) Excellent. Very accessible

(Original)
Excelente. Muy Accesible"
14099,Great equipment
14100,Omg this place was delicious!! And decent priced for hibachi and a restaurant in Alaska haha I spent about 30 bucks and it fed me for 2 meals.
14101,"Just had breakfast here, it's okay.  Kind of skimpy on the gravy though."
14102,"Had watered down miso soup, sparse seaweed salad and an order of vegetable tempura. The ""tempura"" was some kind of heavy crusty batter that was really over fried, and the vegetables were obviously previously frozen so ended up undercooked. Horrible mess of a meal and I'll never get that $17 back."
14103,"Quick and easy order on the app. Have picked up cheese breads, BBQ pizza, Hawaiian pizza, cinnamon sticks. Usually ready in 20 mins or so. During COVID, you can choose contactless delivery to your car parked outside. Convenient and safe. The food is regular Dominos, nothing exotic. But its something to get when you don't want to think about dinner and easy choices."
14104,Cozy atmosphere and good alcohol selection
14105,"Good food, good atmosphere. Located in the strip mall behind Mooses Tooth. Prices seem to be a little higher than other Sushi establishments in Anchorage. Overall enjoyable."
14106,"Wow! All I can say right now is- WOW! The customer service I just experienced was OUT OF THIS WORLD AWESOME!

Tonight I went into Alaska Tent and Tarp in hopes to find a couple of one off fasteners in hope I could Jimmy rig a netted dog barrier project for my truck. Not only did they actually have the couple pieces I needed BUT they took the time to listen to me and helped me come up with a solution to my issue.

The personalized customer service from Alaska Tent and Tarp should be enough to get you in their front doors."
14107,Good grocery store
14108,This is one of my favorite places! Good food. Fast service. Lots of funny stuff to read on the walls. :) Take a gander and go try em!
14109,Great cool place to slowly walk around and see and feel everything. Cool old log cabin.

14115,Great little airport. Friendly and rarely any wait time.
14116,The margaritas are great & the people are super friendly!!
14117,Cabela's is always a fun place to go. It has a ton of outdoor equipment. The prices can be a little bit high for some stuff.
14118,It is huge there awesome to walk or ride your bike. Also in winter time you can go there and ice skate because there is a huge river that turns into ice and a lot people go there.
14119,"Not all Qdoba's are equal here in Alaska, but this branch is a really good one. Friendly staff, big portions."
14120,"Best ""mega-store"" in the area with usually fresh deli and fair prices."
14121,"Not the most Alaskan rv park, but it's got great staff and such a good spot to jump top adventure from"
14122,"Best climbing gym in all of Anchorage for sure! They have a huge bouldering area as well as too roping and lead climbing routes. They even have a pretty decent gym attached that has squat bars, a few treadmills, rowing machine and strength training equipment. They have yoga classes there on certain days that you can add to your membership too. Great staff and a great gym!"
14123,I've had a few different burgers from there and they were all good. But they are pricey though. The burgers start at 7.99. And that's just the for the burger.
14124,"The server was unfriendly, and gave of that vibe she just didn't wish to be there. The food came out hot, but that's where the positive review ends. The calzone sauce tasted like cheap store bought, and definitely not made in house."
14125,Wonderful food and Turkish coffee!
14126,Great little coffee hut.
14127,The staff and city clerks are very rude
14128,Very nice since they remodeled in 2018. Fast service and friendly staff. Good McDonald's all around.
14129,"This place rules! First off, late night eats until 5am, perfect for hungry service industry folks. Ruben egg rolls, pork belly tacos, breakfast burritos, steaks, sandwiches, salads, milk shakes... The variety is great and the quality is high! $10/avg menu item price. Cool aesthetic inside, too."
14130,"Fun place to eat,plus great food."
14131,Nothing bad to say about this place
14132,"Good golf course, enjoy it. The fair way is a little too bumpy for a golf cart though..."

14134,Great steaks and service as per franchise standards
14135,Haven't really stayed here yet

14138,Good
14139,It's McDonald's everybody knows what it's like in there
14140,"The music is always on point, the weed is affordable.  The hand blown custom pipes are legit to look at as well."
14141,Awesome
14142,Great clam chowder and perfect prime rib - both classic and blackened. I always end up taking left overs home. Booths aren't very comfortable - tables definitely the way to go. It's great in the summer and winter (which for locals is sometimes hard to find)
14143,Clean good price
14144,Always good comfort food and friendly service.
14145,"Food‚Äôs amazing, customer service is great. Must do if you‚Äôre visiting anchorage. Be prepared to wait for a seat during busy times  or order to go."
14146,"Good location, sometimes the food can tend to be a bit haphazard, but they are busy so no big deal overall. Tastes just like any other taco bell so good ratings for consistency."
14147,I enjoy Great Harvest when just wanting sandwich or soup. I've always had friendly service and everything is always fresh and delicious
14148,one of the best dark spots in fairbanks
14149,Good place to eat & watch sports with friends and family
14150,He couldn't put a remote start in my car so I got reimbursed from Groupon. He was very nice and helpful.
14151,"Went there for lunch today and I had a mocha that was fantastic, then a panini, that was delicious too  very cute place, The best view ever !!!"
14152,Great service and food top notch
14153,This place is a pass.
14154,"The food was great, the service was lacking, I know it was lunch rush but I feel like the service could have been way better."
14155,"I've lived here for just under a month and everything has been great. Within walking distance to all the cool places downtown, the price to rent is great for what you're getting,  and the office staff are friendly and professional. Tina King is especially great, I'm new to the area and she has been very helpful and patient with helping me with the rental process and telling me places to visit around town."
14156,Fantastic! I had their stuffed French toast and it was amazing! The service was wonderful! If I'm in the area again I would totally go back.
14157,Best movie theater in town
14158,Always friendly
14159,"On the Anchorage Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram website they have a coupon for $39.95 Synthetic Blend Oil and I called two weeks prior about it and was told, ""yeah we have that, first come first serve.""
So today I go in to get the oil change special and the guy at the counter says ""yeah we take those coupons."" (Which are on the Anchorage dealerships website) then he reads it and says ""oh no, we only have Full Synthetic sorry."" (Why is an oil blend they don't carry being advertised?) He continues to tell me they have a special, two oil changes for $99.95 which I agree to,  he takes my keys and tells me I'll pay the $99.95 after they service it. Sure, thanks.  I mention to him a sensor failure notification and he tells me he will get it looked at, likely needs cleared or may need an update.
I go to pay and he tells me I'm not eligible for the two for $99.95 ""likely because it was purchased pre-owned"" and my total is now $70. Nearly double the expected cost. I get in and the sensor fail notification is still there, great. I assume was forgotten to be checked as he never mentioned it at checkout, only told me about how my oil change just jumped from $40>$50>$70.

There's plenty of Jeep dealerships in Anchorage, if you need yours serviced I wouldn't recommend this one."
14160,Always have great food the pizza is awesome. Nice place.
14161,"Good food, but lots of wasted time and resources spent on frivolous activities."
14162,"Food was okay, but not worth the price. Service was okay. Better places to eat at but it's not bad."
14163,Too cool
14164,The experience is always a delight
14165,Only place in Anchorage for your haircut.
14166,Matt was amazing! He got me into a great car at a great price! Easy no hassle no pressure! This was the best car purchasing experience I've ever had!
14167,This the best dining facility on JBER by far
14168,What a great place to visit and hike.  Look out for bears. Good spots to stop and eat carry water and plan to hike your trash out. Beautiful boat ride to the dock.
14169,Love the ice cream
14170,Panang curry amazing! Great atmosphere and friendly people.
14171,"Stopped in desperate for fiber for a 10 year old goldfish with a swim bladder problem. Pleasant encounter with knowledgeable staff member. Left with 10 minutes later with a bag full of plants for $20. Much better deal than the large chain stores where you can buy one plant in a cylindrical tube for $6.
Our office has used Alaska Coral for years as a source for everything we need for a saltwater tank. Their knowledge and resources keep us loyal."
14172,French frys
14173,Awesome I use them twice a year.
14174,"Meh, its okay"
14175,"Delicious food, quick service."
14176,Amazing place
14177,Fresh food with quick and friendly service! Nice and clean lobby.
14178,"My family loves red robin. The food is amazing.  My family has ordered from this red robin roughly 7 times. We get the same thing everytime. The cooks have  gotten our order wrong all 7 times. I called & the manager nate is awesome.  He apologized & fixed the problem immediately. He would say, please don't give up on us, we will get it right. The last time I ordered,  everything was perfect.  Food was amazing,  service waS great and grubhub is definitely fast delivering red robin."
14179,"I love the selection at DB. I went there for my wedding and now I'm shopping for my mothers-in-law wedding. I tried on quite a few dresses this time and I think I found a winner.

My only complaint is about the salesgirls. McKayla and Jasmine were assigned to me but weren't there when I needed them. I wouldn't mind except I was one of the only customers in the store. My husband ended up helping me with buttoning and zipping 90% of my dresses.

I will definitely be back but it would be nice to have more attentive staff to help next time."
14180,"Tasty food with large quantities of meat. May not be ideal if you are a vegetarian. The place is at a good location along the highway, making it a good place to eat. They unfortunately don't accept credit cards and their atm doesn't always work."
14181,"Had a great time at the Bridge Lounge. It is conveniently located. It sits facing the world famous Kenai River! The atmosphere is friendly  laid back, and the decor is great. The Bartenders were super friendly and were a pleasure. I enjoyed my drink and the appetizer that I got was delicious! I would absolutely reccomend the Bridge Lounge!"
14182,Biscuit club.  The staff there are 5 stars just like the food. Looking forward to April 1st . win you're open again
14183,Great customer service and quick to make the customer happy
14184,Good place to find good fashionable clothing at a decent price. I'd recommend looking at the clearance rack because the prices there are much easier to deal with.
14185,Very good place to shop.  Especially.  9 months out of the yr no tax on grocerys
14186,Great food atmosphere and service and the pizza is fantastic
14187,"Always great for, people working there are always nice too. Delivery is quick."
14188,"Good food, friendly staff"
14189,Descent
14190,Over price joints and pipes. Joints don't smoke and pipes are 3x what you would pay at any other place I've been to
14191,Great selection of clothes! I always thoroughly enjoy thrifting here!‚ò∫Ô∏è
14192,Great place to safely view some Alaskan wildlife...
14193,"Good service,  mediocre food."
14194,It wouldn't be so bad if the employees actually were willing to help customers
14195,Nice place
14196,good prices that everybody can afford
14197,"Very good, we meet a friend named Pete."
14198,Always enjoy ordering wings from them. One of the best place to order wings
14199,I stay gobblin‚Äô. A quality spot
14200,"Friendly stuff, good food, full bar, they keep temperature very low brrr"
14201,Other than the attendant hitting on my husband in front of me it was great.
14202,Great food!

14204,Great food! Really good food. That almost seems unique for Anchorage
14205,My wife and I were looking all over for a wedge pillow and finally found the perfect one here. We also bought another gel pillow. Great price and great service. Amber was the the person who helped us and she was great. Very nice and knowledgeable on all the products there. Because of Amber my wife and I will return here again to buy a new bed. I recommend this place to everyone.
14206,Great atmosphere and good food.  Just make sure you have a reservation!
14207,Had a great time with friends here. This is a very busy place so it takes a bit longer to get food. Go there knowing that and enjoy yourself its worth the wait.
14208,one of the few things you can do in fairbanks!
14209,Great little hike with nice views
14210,"Great food, Great service"
14211,Clean and safe with value
14212,My car was in desperate need of a detail from the winter grime and I just finally got to it. These guys did a wonderful job and my car is SPARKLING! Will absolutely be back
14213,Expensive for what you're actually getting. Our waitress was amazing though. My plate had several pieces of fried fish and a head of broccoli (I'm not exaggerating) with hollandaise. For an upscale restaurant I expected a little more thought or flavor to go into the dish.
14214,"Respectful and monitored well, professional service."
14215,Hands down the best dispensary in town! They have amazing deals every week and the customer service is spot on.  Definitely our go-to dispensary here in ANC.
14216,Very busy today with holiday shoppers.
14217,Only place left in the bowl to score food unmolested ü§£
14218,"Find at least half the cannabis supplies youll ever need here lol. A lil pricy yes but if time is an issue this place and high bush and phat tops are the places to go for your complete cannabis experience lol. Im 420 friendly. Nonetheless use responsibly. Remember you drink or drive high, its a dui. So dont get carried away kpd doesnt play games, i know this. Still doesnt make em right just telling you because it would be irresponsiblr of me not to."
14219,"Any kind of workout machines, you need to workout on and more."
14220,Nice campground
14221,"Becky is the best server ever!!!!!! She's friendly, knowledgeable and has awesome stories.!!!!! We ask to be seated in her area whenever we dine!"
14222,Good prices well stocked
14223,Got my rental car cleans befor returning it.
14224,"Always great food, reasonably priced.  Not sure they need to charge me .49 ¬¢ for a side of ranch, but hey, times are tough for a restaurant."
14225,Love the new game cards!
14226,Love shopping here for lower cost food items.
14227,Fun place good finds
14228,"Excellent staff, very helpful."
14229,Good pizza for the price.  I always  have the 2 slice and drink special. Big slices of pizza too!
14230,My favorite shop muldoon
14231,Always very friendly and helpful. They have a wonderful selection of items too.
14232,Always clean and usually willing to help.
14233,"I personally don't like the smell of ducks, so that was a bit off puting. Walking around the lake is very nice though, people are allowed to fish and boat. There is also a play ground for little kids."
14234,They have some work to do. Clean. Decent location
14235,If I'm going to pay 15 dollars for a cup of coffee and light breakfast in an area it might as well be good. Black bear makes good stuff and has solid coffee.
14236,"Came here with some guys from work for dinner and to hang out. The service was a little slow but the food was amazing. We got the seafood nachoes which I highly recommend. It is pieces of salmon and shrimp with cheese and some kind of sauce on top of tortilla chips. The perfect blend of flavors. For the main dish I ordered the fish and chips. I would say skip the chips and order the fries. The chips were delicious but the fries were amazing. The fish tasted amazing but fell apart too much to eat with your hands and dip in the sauce, so a fork might make it easier. Overall this place is delicious and I highly recommend it."
14237,No issues
14238,"Order has been incorrect the last 3 times we have went through the drive-thru. Not sure if being closed for ""renovations"" for almost a year made everyone go brain dead or not. Prices have also increased significantly in my opinion. 13 bucks for a  burger/fry/drink combo, is ridiculous for fast food. Would rather go spend that kind of money on a sit-sown joint and order my burger, cooked to my liking.

THE ONLY REASON this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is due to the Frosty.

That is all."
14239,I like the new equipment.
14240,Many different vegetables and crafts here! Definitely worth visiting!
14241,The trails are truly peaceful
14242,"Friendly staff, reasonably  priced"
14243,"Its a round up alright. Our family went there one Saturday, tomatoes had mole on them hamburger meat not cooked"
14244,Great pub with good service and food.
14245,"My wife and I bought a truck from Brett, he had it shipped from anchorage in a timely manner, we drove it off the lot in no time at all."
14246,Pilots gave a great story about the planed
14247,"The food is great,üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ"
14248,Great sushi spot
14249,"Before arriving, I had reviewed the online menu and made my decision based off of that. Upon arrival though, I was told that much of the online menu is not available to be ordered in person. I was unable to get anything except 3 types of breakfast burritos. We both got the chorizo breakfast burrito, which was very well prepared but took about 35 minutes to be served in an empty cafe at 10 AM. The coffee and americano were both tasty and promptly served. I spoke with the man that was working about the confusion of the online menu and perhaps a disclaimer could accompany the online menu. I am not dissatisfied with the food or the service, but would give a better review if all menu items were available. I will definitely return, this time with a better understanding of how this cafe works."
14250,Delicious beef soft tacos! Love the nachos but my family didn't help me eat it as much as I thought they would. Next time I'll order 3 soft beef tacos and a side of beans or rice.
14251,Sal Mart.. Enough said
14252,"Big fan of frozen yogurt. Decent place, prices aren't awful. Kind of dirty when I was there."
14253,Wonderful.
14254,"It has a bar, food is standard large corporation fare. Nuke and eat. Stage is good if they can bring in people worth seeing ."
14255,"Ginger is a great place for fusion foods. The place is clean, classy and the staff are wonderful and well dressed."
14256,High octane coffee. Local vibe and so Alaskan...fun
14257,"Interesting, knowledgeable experience. It‚Äôs a one time thing. I don‚Äôt think I would do it again but I definitely learned a lot. So if you have the money, do it."
14258,I wish they would open another location! It's always packed whenever I go. The food is worth it though.
14259,Rough and durable with good service and good sandwiches
14260,Still the best burger in the valley. I'd post a pic of my burger but it was eaten before thinking about it.
14261,"(Translated by Google) Restaurant located on the port.
At the beginning the menu seemed a bit expensive to us but the dishes really gave us cravings.
We had a table upstairs where there is a very large bay window which gives a very nice view of the mountains.
Before choosing a beer, we were offered to taste a sample to choose between different tastes, I've never seen that elsewhere it's great!
We had the Salmon and the Scallop Mac.
The salmon is cooked to perfection and is placed on a Thai-style rice, a real delight!
The other dish is a Mac & cheese made from scallops, a delicious dish.
The. Service is welcoming and warm.
We got it for $ 80 for two with 1 beer and 2 courses plus taxes and tips.
It might be a bit high but it's totally worth the trip because it's delicious!
I preferred this restaurant to other cheaper ones in cities which were not great.

Au d√©part la carte nous semblait un peu ch√®re mais les plats nous ont vraiment donn√©s envies.
Nous avons eu une table √† l'√©tage o√π il y a une tr√®s grande baie vitr√©e qui donne une tr√®s belle vue sur les montagnes.
Avant de choisir une bi√®re, on nous a propos√© de go√ªt√© un √©chantillon pour choisir entre diff√©rents go√ªts, je n'ai jamais vu √ßa ailleurs c'est top !
Nous avons pris le Saumon et le Scallop Mac.
Le saumon est cuit √† la perfection et est pos√© sur un riz fa√ßon Thai, un vrai d√©lice !
L'autre plat c'est un Mac & cheese a base de noix de St Jacques, un plat d√©licieux.
Le. Service est accueillant et chaleureux.
Nous en avons eu pour $80 √† deux avec 1 bi√®re et 2 plats plus taxes et tips.
Cest peut √™tre un peu √©lev√© mais √ßa vaut carr√©ment le d√©tour car c'est d√©licieux !
J'ai pr√©f√©r√© ce restaurant √† d'autres moins chers en villes qui n'√©taient pas top."
14262,Loved the museum.
14263,Loved it
14264,Pretty great bowls and stuff
14265,Have to find the right employee for help but when you do the skys the limit
14266,"Came in on a Monday, had a very civil and courteous walk around, no pressure sales tour of Side by sides by sales manager Chad. Shopped around, and these guys certainly had the best deal available...few days later, new owner of a Rzr XP1000.

Very straightforward, courteous and professional staff, A++, go buy from this place. They do things right and ask for Chad."
14267,I thought Sears was out of business.
14268,Loved the customer service and the pizza!
14269,"Some very tasty foods, Specials board every day, Taco Tuesdays, plenty of options in a we'll staffed and clean environment."
14270,Great prices!
14271,The name tells you what you need to know
14272,Exceptional service and reasonably priced! Thank you.
14273,Good service.. clean..friendly staff
14274,Good tourist selection but not real market.
14275,"Great staff, a few other things were okay. Didn't have a lot of selection- running out of stock and it was only halfway through the day. But it's still a young industry"
14276,Great food.  Can't wait to try out more on the menu.
14277,Beautiful beach. My favorite place to reset my mind. It's like a screensaver from a computer lol.
14278,Nice place to go that's near by.
14279,Ten year old sent the Wolf Yard into group Howelling.- - - LOL !!!
14280,"High prices, has a red box for movie rental."
14281,These guys worked really well with my and my kitty's needs and I'll keep going back
14282,Best grocery store in Anchorage
14283,Friendly staff and relatively quick service when there are two baristas working. Can be a bit slow if there's only one.
14284,Not a great place to be.
14285,"Slow slow slow.  Its McDs food as expected but  Always slow.  This morning I went thru the drive through and ordered 2 sausage McMuffin with out egg.  I was 3rd in line. It took a bit of time, I got to the window.  I waited, I could see the staff talking with each other.  After 3 minutes, the guy came to the window and asked me to park and they would bring it out.  I just left.

I don't understand.  3 ingredients - muffin, cheese and sausage party.  No coffee, no hash browns no drink.  I thought these were standard breakfast items readily available.

It's the slowest fast food around!"
14286,"Decent bar with plenty of Alaskan beers. It's not finicky, and they slug 25 oz mugs your way. No complaints."
14287,I've been coming here for four years thanks to Devon I will no longer be returning at least that's what she told me her name was
14288,"Outstanding Alaska cultural heritage center,  great worth of information. Worth the time. Enjoy!!"
14289,"Pretty good place to stop in an eat if you feel like not cooking. Really good food, but it's still just a breakfast food place to me. Service is great, waitress's are nice an friendly. Great place to go if your feel like eating breakfast still food. I go here usually once every couple weeks."
14290,Nice clean fairly priced
14291,Yummy subs!!! Delivered very quickly and they were busy!  Impressive
14292,The Job Center has everything you need to find a job and very convenient location and hours
14293,"To truly experience the park, you should hike its trails and off the beaten path.  The 4.5 mile Savage river hike is a good one.  I wouldn't recommend for young kiddos but older kids are fine.  Be sure to bring a windbreaker as it gets windy towards the top."
14294,This is a great and friendly place. They have many of their own products and also do consignment. I have not had the opportunity to meet the owner but I have only heard good things about him. I bought this jade bracelet while I was there.  It fits great and I love it.  I encourage you to go experience it for yourself and I know you will find something you will love.
14295,I went there to have a WIC card replaced on the 30th of October and was able to get a new one right away. However I went shopping and was at the register when I discovered that it was not loaded. I had to leave the WIC items there. I paid cash for the produce and half a gallon of milk because I was completely out.
14296,"The service was awful. We wished we left when we told the person at the counter we wanted to eat in and she told us we had to pay first. There is no water offered at the tables. It's incredibly loud because there is no sound barrier between the kitchen and the dining area. The food was very, very bland. The Asian food you get at Fred Meyers or Safeway is far more flavorful. This was a cafeteria-style experience at restaurant prices. We came here after reading reviews and were left astounded that Fairbanks standards for good Asian-American food are so low."
14297,Slow service
14298,I go here every day! Wonderful service and the staff always remembers me! Great rewards punch cards that get you 4 dollars off after 9 orders which is great! Care always goes into their products and their smoothies are the best in town!
14299,"Must be in the middle of  reorganizing, place was a mess"
14300,Great outdoor place!
14301,Great food and service
14302,Outstanding selection.
14303,"This is the best view of the city. It is easy to walk around and offers options to walk, bike, or hike in numerous directions. Take the hike up Flattop mountain for an even more spectacular view!"
14304,Excellent
14305,Good food
14306,They seems to always have what I need for my fishing and hunting trips.
14307,"Good food, average service, expensive."
14308,only 15 minutes on Wi-Fi per order.. that is pitiful.. like Wi-Fi is a commodity..
14309,Fascinating tour featuring history of gold mining in the area.
14310,The food is always fantastic
14311,Comfy beds clean and pet friendly
14312,Fun place to shop. I went there for a picture frame 10x10 but they didn't have any.
14313,"I have been here multiple times and am so underwhelmed every time I go.The donuts are not that great you would get roughly the same quality at Fred Meyers or Carr's maybe better for a cheaper price, and their donuts don't look very appealing either it looks like a child made them. I buy a bakers dozens for an expensive price and the donuts are put into a small box so that if any icing was on one it was now on two others or more. I can't say anything about the rest of the things they serve but they shouldn't make donuts anymore or get someone else to make them. Golden donuts is still the best in Anchorage and cheaper"
14314,"Not going to lie my wife and I were a little hurt when we came here. They ran out of Ribs and we were looking forward to ribs. Other than that the food was amazing. The service was good especially since they deliver and people come to dine in or pick up food. We ended up ordering a whole chicken with four sides which was really cheap. I'm glad we split the meal because it was a lot of food, and we had a lot of leftovers. The chicken was literally falling off the bone which is a plus. Id suggest getting there early if they do specials on their ribs again because they might run out of them. Good restaurant at a good price."
14315,"Awful customer service. Felt like everyone there was super inexperienced or didn't even know they layout of their store.
Clothes here are cute, but don't expect any help. And don't get bra sizes here, the woman who did mine was 4 sizes wrong."
14316,I like their food and beer. I've only eaten at this location twice but both times I've been very happy with it.
14317,Small town hardware with helpful staff and surprisingly large selection.
14318,"Does not take 30 minutes for a burger. If so let us know ahead of time to make plans.  Edited my review after eating the burger, avocado was rock hard, poor flavor meat."
14319,Great company.
14320,"Love these guys, they really are so good to mama and I"
14321,"High prices, slow non existent service"
14322,"The wait was 1.25 hours. No kidding. I'm glad my friend and I weren't in a hurry.
The waitress was dynamite! She made up for the long wait. The place was packed and she must have been exhausted but she didn't show it.
The salmon spread was delicious. I had soup and my friend had salad, both of which were okay."
14323,Very very delicious food and nice staff
14324,Worst coffee of all time....
14325,Nice but expensive
14326,Fast effecient. Not a lot of food but it was enough. Love the pancakes & butter pecan syrup.
14327,Great food quick service limited atmosphere but the quality especially for the price makes up for it.
14328,Hank and the team always have great advice and if they don't have the instrument they work to get it.
14329,"Cozy cabins, friendly staff in a beautiful setting."
14330,Great sandwiches!
14331,"The food is good, but this location is always out of something the last several months."
14332,Always have a good time here. Pizza is consistent and always good. We usually get mushroom or steak pizza and its delicious. Always buy our gift cards at costco $100 worth for $75. Even though pizza is a bit pricey it evens out when we use our costco gift cards.
14333,Fun place
14334,"Dave & Buster's has it all! D&B Family friendly Restuarant & Sports themed Bar, Arcade games for all ages. D&B Ticket exchange for toys, gifts & prizes! Great for all ages!"
14335,Ah..  enforcement of the masks. Not a pleasant visit when you are asked to leave because you don't have a mask. Places will lose business
14336,Found the Pine lozenges to try. They are good.
14337,"I ordered the French Dip, it had melted white horseradish cheese on it and sauteed onions with mushrooms , and homemade as jus sauce. I ordered the side salad with citrus vinaigrette instead of fries, it was all fantastic.  Will go there again."
14338,"One of the best pizza places I've ever visited in my life. I've gone through about 1/3 of the whole menu at this point, and none of the food items have disappointed me. Variety is key, from the types of pizzas to the sauce and crust varieties, to their constantly-rotating list of house-brewed beers on tap. You can visit here for a couple of years and not have the same experience twice (although I have already developed a couple of favorites). I would recommend getting there sometime before the dinner rush, as lines can form out the door all the way to the parking lot (especially on the weekends)."
14339,Great selection of product
14340,Closing soon
14341,Normally love the book store....but two very imposing security guards at the door made me question what was really going on in there!
14342,Thank you for all your great services and assistance
14343,Very helpful even had me come back for formula next day cause they didn't have any
14344,"A little pricey, but no more so than the rest of the area.

Best french onion soup I've had.

They do regular specials, have a good beer selection, attentive (and often cute!) staff, and great food.

The halibut is one of my favorites!"
14345,"Awesome, great customer service üíØ"
14346,Legendary Fairbanks bar and grill
14347,A friendly tourist place to visit.
14348,Has beer but the food isn't great
14349,Great food and clean place!
14350,"Great service for elders, patients and family escorts."
14351,"It's got good prices,  eager staff."
14352,"It‚Äôs a decent location, and I believe it‚Äôs the only one open 24 hours or at least it was before the Covid. The staff are friendly and usually fast. The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is because its not the cleanest parking lot, i have had to park farther away to avoid broken glass and vomit too."
14353,"One of the best vantage points for pictures. If you enjoy watching planes, boats or birds. Just keep control of your children as it has a very steep cliff and getting back up is another story."
14354,It is a bit pricey but worth it. We really liked the fresh new experience & food quality.
14355,Lovely shop and pleasant friendly helpful staff.
14356,"While the room was lovely, I was woken at 3am by a truck emptying the dumpsters outside, and at 5am by hotel employees loading luggage for cruise passengers. It was incredibly disruptive and when I actually got up in the morning I was still exhausted."
14357,Favorite coffee shop. Hands down.
14358,"Fun bar for the younger crowd great music selection, it is wheel chair accessable, its a smoking bar but its outside in its own little room to the side so dont need to worry about second hand smoke. But a great up beat bar and totally worth getting a drink or two there."
14359,Love their menu!
14360,More product for coffee shop
14361,Fun quick trails
14362,"My burrito supreme tasted ok but the Mexican pizza was horrible.  It had some sort of nasty taste to it.  I don't know if the latest cleaning protocols or cleaning products had anything to do with it,  but the taste wasn't nowhere near normal."
14363,Their general tso is great
14364,Can't beat a big Mac and fries
14365,"Amazing thai food, good service.  Very authentic, who'd have thought Asian food in Fairbanks Alaska could be so good.  But when you have thai people making it, I suppose you could be in Antarctica and it would still be amazing.  Their spice is really good, I usually order medium hot and that's perfect for me.  It can be super hot if you order it that way so be careful."
14366,Juneau
14367,"Vagabond Blues is my favorite coffee in the valley. Great atmosphere, friendly service and the perfect sludge cup."
14368,Outdated
14369,"5 star pizza, been here multiple times but the chicken, bacon spinach pizza we picked up yesterday with a generous amount of creamy garlic sauce for a base!"
14370,"Always an amazing Mocha breve, pupachinnos and friendly faces"
14371,"Fast service, great customer service and delicious üç©!!!! I can't complain üòã"
14372,Always delicious! Got takeaway and they had carefully packaged everything (not easy to do with soup!)
14373,Always good until you've had it for 7 days straight.
14374,If you don't need any help to find something it's alright but you need help from a employee to find something you might as well go to another store.
14375,"Super friendly,  super knowledgable,  these folks really know how to do coffee right!"
14376,"Pretty cool to see the bears and other wildlife here but some of the animals seem to be in too small cages, which is rather sad but it's a good place for left behind animals that they still have a place to stay."
14377,Nice place
14378,"Always delighted to come in. The workers are even better, very knowledgeable of what comes their way :)."
14379,"Took the shuttle into the park to wonder lake. Great shuttle with wonderful driver JJ. They stop if you see wildlife and allow you take pictures or even if it's just a great scenary spot. Saw two families of Grizzlies, doll sheep, caribou, and a moose."
14380,There monster biscuit breakfast is good.
14381,Lots of items not stocked by the big box stores. Reasonable prices and a 10% Millitary discount.
14382,Great views from this train.
14383,Almost a shame it's closing
14384,"U get a beautiful view, very nice people there"
14385,"The upgraded luxury recliners are awesome, makes going to the theater enjoyable again!"
14386,Delicious!
14387,They always have everything i neec
14388,Had dinner here our first night in Denali. The  fried bread appetizer was delicious. We also had schnitzel and the moussaka. Portions were large and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.
14389,"(Translated by Google) It is a good store if you are looking for economy

(Original)
Es un buena tienda si buscas economia"
14390,"I'm all for small businesses giving something a try, but this place needs to pivot and find something they enjoy selling. Buying ice cream on a sunny day should be a treat, not a regretful decision.

The owners mother served us and after agreeing to her rule to take our pizza box trash with us after being done (just get bigger trash cans guys!) she then took our order and wanted immediate payment... Her response to customers about the 1 dollar credit surcharge was despicable - Square charges a fraction of that.. But all of this was nothing compared to the wait, there were other customers and I actually timed that it took them on average 14 mins to serve each ONE handmade ice cream. So don't order two..

The staff seemed disinterested, the ice cream was okay and the space is nicely decorated and pretty clean.. But if you're gonna go here, I recommend you make your order and get on the couch if they let you, and just order extra sweet ice cream to sweeten the sour service."
14391,Great seats and concedsion line drsign works well!
14392,Organic options are needed.
14393,"Couldn't be happier with the food and atmosphere. When the cook comes out, pot of food in hand, to give your another spoonful of deliciousness, you can't help but love the place. Highly recommend!"
14394,"This is beautiful and brand new.  Great location for Anchorage folk.  The prices are reasonable, knowledgable budtenders (shout out to my man Josh).  Of course their product is very good too.  I heard rumors of them selling $25 1/8's and low and behold the sweet tangerine was that deal. Score.  Cherry on top for true stoners, is the infinity grow room you can see from the retail area"
14395,Great produce !
14396,A big spacious hang out with the to be expected amazing coffee.
14397,This is the only dealership I feel like I'm not going to get hassled at and have to play a bunch of stupid games to arrive at the best deal. I have purchased 2 cars from here and both purchases were quick and still good deals. Even the other lithia dealerships are not this way. My only disappointment with this dealership is that it seems to be lacking in inventory at times.
14398,Super nice workers!!!!
14399,"Just a little hole in the wall, but don't let that scare you.  Their fried shrimp is AWESOME, as are their scallops.  They might have the best clam chowder in Anchorage."
14400,"I hope this shopping mart stays open forever..My name sake is the owner..Friendly,,down-to-earth.."
14401,This place is amazing! Super friendly and supportive.
14402,Has great food.
14403,"Convenient location in town, Everything close."
14404,Great breakfast
14405,Omg BEST FOOD great staff great time for the whole family. So worth it!
14406,"Very quick and friendly service. Open early too, which is nice if you are planning a big event later."
14407,Never again
14408,I'm a wedding photographer and shot a wedding at the resort. Amazing location across the bay!
14409,Love that they sell mooses tooth rootbeer and that dollar shots are great.
14410,I got my suit for my daughters wedding and it looked great if I say so myself. They tailored it and when I picked it up it fit really great. The shoes I got fit very good and looked even better. Everyone there was real personable and friendly. I recommend Mens Wearhouse for all your mens fashion needs.
14411,Always great to stop in at and it is badge gas not torsoro
14412,Great hometown joint.
14413,I really enjoyed chicken teriyaki flavors we're great. However my guess had the all you can eat sushi and there was way too much rice.
14414,Extremely long wait to be seated and then again for our food. Hamburgers were all overcooked to the point of being dry and charred.  Had to flag down wait staff for drink refills etc. Next visit to Talkeetna I will try a different restaurant.
14415,Staffed by friendly locals this venue hosts a wide array of local and traveling talents. The only reasons I don't give it a five-star is due to lack of any dancing floor space and sound quality issues on more than one occasion
14416,Nicole was a great guide! She created a team feel. We all worked and celebrated success together. Lots of fun and very safe.
14417,Like the coffee
14418,Non-union. Do not go
14419,Gordon and his staff are awesome and very professional. Great food and awesome atmosphere.  Can't wait till they start serving beer. Soon I hear.
14420,Great family gathering
14421,"Look, it is the farthest north HD in the world so it has to be great, but small."
14422,Chili verde chimichanga! Thank me later
14423,I'm blaming my wife she has created a crochet monster with the help of joann's and youtube. I picked up a pattern book $60 in yarn and a pack of hooks. Guess what everyone is getting for next Christmas. Ho ho ho
14424,The halibut was great but the french fries overly salted.
14425,Always be open to new talk
14426,"Living in Alaska for 5+ years I forget we have a Burlington. I am a regular target or Walmart shopper. But Burlington is where its at. Besides the store being a little messy, carts that are hard to find. The store is a really great place to find if you move to Alaska and need things for your new place. I wanted to decorate my place and I looked everywhere except Burlington and I found what I needed as soon as I entered. The price won't disappoint you. It remind me of Ross in Hawaii."
14427,Great daily specials.
14428,"Now this place is owned by the Mormon's who believe that anyone who is not Caucasian is a second class citizen in which is evident in the way they take advantage of the Filipino work force in this Ktown store. They make them work long hours and only give them one day off in the week. On top of that when they are off they may be asked to come in, or when working, ask to work extended hours. This place takes advantage of a culture knowing that most Filipinos will not say ""NO"" to ""The Man"". Also, although an individual can work there for years there may only be a small bump in pay every few years. When this store can boost moral and pay for my brown Brothers and Sisters then I may give a hire rating."
14429,Fantastic newburg and ceasers!! Beer was excellent
14430,Kodiak  history.
14431,Excellent! Great food
14432,"I‚Äôm giving them a five but do wish it was a little warmer for spectators. I know, what kind of Alaskan complains about the temperature in an ice rink? Just layer up, bring a blanket to sit on and get some hot cocoa at their concession stand (not always open, so a thermos from home works too). Ice is at a premium in Anchorage and Dempsey Anderson helps meet the need. Very conveniently located in the Spenard/Turnagain area. I‚Äôm here watching the Chugiak/Eagle River HS girls hockey team skate against Service/East. It‚Äôs always great fun to watch strong young women play! This rink is part of Anchorage‚Äôs long hockey history and I‚Äôm sure Mr. Anderson would be proud to see that his dedication toward engaging youth in the sport has continued."
14433,Great food. High prices and won't substitute or bring small sides.
14434,Great Service! We were in and out quickly. It was the most painless car buying experience I've had yet!
14435,"The Spenard Roadhouse is one of the best restaurants in Anchorage. While the food is reasonably priced, the quality is very high and the variety is great. The restaurant is well-decorated and the customer service is excellent. Very family friendly. Very cozy and comfortable atmosphere. Highly recommend."
14436,It's taco bell. This one is usually pretty quick.
14437,Super slow service
14438,"nice setup, good for a wedding!"
14439,Love this place !
14440,"Excellent coffee,  MORGAN gives the best service!!!"
14441,Great store for gear. Staff was awesome and they have the best prices on xtratufs!
14442,"Unbelievable selection of items, fun to visit and look around"
14443,Don't really like the site.  I like to calculate my mortgage and check distance for my spouses work and your site is a bit hard to do that.  Also I like to see the pricing history as well.
14444,Average west side park
14445,"i would definitely recommend frosted axe to anyone. the axe masters are amazing and help teach you step by step how to successfully throw everything they have. they have awesome games you can play, and they even go as far as to show you trick shots if you do well! awesome music, great people, and good pricing."
14446,ok but i don't like it

14448,A true ALASKAN experience.. and I find using the word Alaskan to be cringey. It's a historical landmark in my eyes and the food is so great. Always has a place in my heart.
14449,"Very clean, well organized store, great friendly staff, and prices surprising good."
14450,Always very helpful
14451,"They're a bit more pricey, but they do offer a variety of foods and treats for your fur babies."
14452,try the halibut fish and chips mmmm
14453,Great bakery!
14454,"It was okay, typical fast food.  Items were missing from the order, the pop machine wasn't dispensing the proper mixture of drinks."
14455,Tasty food at reasonable prices.
14456,I really like this place! It's an old-school place with lots to entertain. I really like the üßÄ steak here. I also like the pool tables. Plenty of TV's make any outing watch worthy here.
14457,Tasty sandwiches coffee and helpful servers
14458,They serve the mc chicken in the breakfast time now yaay!!!
14459,Great Prices!
14460,Nice facility
14461,"Forget the negative reviews!!  These guys are priced for the region, have good food, and will adjust the menu for your needs.  Only negative is expired diet sodas.  But that is most of Utqiagvik.  Keep up the good work northern lights!!"
14462,ok experience when i purchased my car last week.  I have had to call the dealer multiple times to get answers about where to take my car for the auto start and the sealants i bought with the purchase.  I was reassured that i would receive exemplary service after my purchase now i am regretting the purchase based on the lack of response.  I have called the dealership 5 times left messages and no response back.  I finally had to call and talked to finance they were finally able to tell me that i did infarct have an appointment scheduled.  The dealer reached out to me on numerous occasions before my purchase the follow up after the purchase has been zero.  I did email the dealer manager no responses and no responses from the sales person.  Over all if you have nothing better to do than to wait on the phone and be transferred this is your place to purchase a car.  they are nice upon purchase but no follow up after so get your questions answered and clarified first.
14463,Great service and wonderful food.
14464,Authentic German cuisine. Delicious.
14465,Great food and service
14466,Be cautious if spending cash That you get back the right amount of change
14467,One the best views in Alaska
14468,Possibly the top place in Anchorage for anbodys running needs.
14469,Our kids loved it!
14470,Good food and service.
14471,"Not like the old days,but again what is."
14472,"Bulk buys, decent prices. No membership which might even out the higher prices than Costco."
14473,Quite spendy as far as the competition goes in the area. Generally too few cashier's and the lines get backed up frequently. Convenient for a late night when Fred Meyer is closed.
14474,Nice to
14475,I hate being followed like I'm going to steal something. The dirty looks are just uncalled for.
14476,Amazing
14477,Always treat you right.
14478,Very nice customer service
14479,Decent wash but not a very strong underbody spray
14480,Always find what I need. Helpful staff. Clean well kept store.
14481,"The room was clean, and spacious. However the annex of the hotel we were in was sketchy we were placed across the hall from a logging training seminar so several mornings big heavy boots stomped down the long hall. Our room had the blow dryer stolen out of it and they treated us like we were dumb when we told them our room didn't have one. The staff were absolutely not welcoming or friendly they all just sit out side the breakfast room and talk and nothing gets restocked for the less than satisfactory breakfast. Our annex building had an overwhelming smell of industrial cleaner and burning electrical systems. We will not be back"
14482,Always fresh always good
14483,Found a bug in my water
14484,Great place to get coffee
14485,"This is a trail system and day parking lot with picnic tables, stunning views...and beautiful trails with cute bridges crossing the creek. That more is the falls by the highway..  and so much more to see as you hike the trails"
14486,Food was Excellent! Service was outstanding!
14487,Kava's has huge portions of delicious diner food! They have a large menu with many options and are very affordable. The staff is friendly and efficient.
14488,"I went there for breakfast. Good portions, friendly service."
14489,Its consistant and good.
14490,"It's a little cramped, but the food is decent"
14491,Great same day pick up. Order was ready in less than an hour.
14492,Great ...
14493,Breakfast here is a must!
14494,There's a great coupon offer when you sign up for their membership program
14495,"This store is better than the Eagle River store.  Much nicer management here, especially the GM & Customer Service Manager.  I come here over that one when I can."
14496,Filet of fish was a lot smaller than I remember
14497,"Good food. A bit loud, but very busy place. Seems popular with the tourists in downtown Anchorage."
14498,Good place to eat
14499,Went for a reset on the auto start and lasted only 3 starts
14500,Always fun going there it opens at 5pm but it is wise to get there beforehand. A long line is usually forming by 445pm. Food is very delicious but expensive. Warning they bring out a tray of desserts and if you say yes they just put in on your table (whichever you choose). Very hard to resist
14501,Great place to see old friends and make new ones.   Great burgers!
14502,"I got my son 2 beef & cheddar sandwiches,a large curly fry and I got the half pound french dip and potato cakes and 2 large jamocha shakes. The roast beef was so dry it was like jerky, the curly fries were seriously overcooked. Several super hard fries and pieces that were inedible. They gave me less than half (of the small container they provide for aus jus) and by the time I got to the second half of my sandwich, it was gone! Half of my french dip with no aus jus! The potato cakes and milkshakes were great...since it's drive through only, AND I spent 20+ minutes getting through the line, then I called and no one answered, what was I to do? If they'd had access to the lobby, I'd have returned it....it was almost $30... I could have gotten great food at a great restaurant for the same money and they all do takeout or delivery and they answer their phones... customer service is important to them... I've been an Arby's customer for 30+ years over 3 states... I'm not wanting to go back anymore and that's just sad...
***8/3/2020*** ATTN: ARBYS personel who replied below asking I go to the address listed to give more information so that this problem can be made right... I tried several times to go to the address you gave and it's a site that can not be reached..."
14503,Great selections of dog coats
14504,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I really enjoy having brunch here as well.  The mimosas and sourdough pancakes are a must at brunch!  I also order the filet mignon pretty frequently and it‚Äôs always perfectly cooked and delicious.  It‚Äôs nice to sit outside in the summer and enjoy the fire pit as well.  I really like how they also have special event dinners with different chefs, cooking classes, and other events like the succulent garden class.  It‚Äôs impressive that they give back to the local community and help with collecting various donations as well.  I have had business dinners, staff dinners, and just enjoyed dining here personally countless times.  It‚Äôs always great!"
14505,"Always great service every visit, and good Mexican food in Alaska."
14506,Calm refreshing  atmosphere
14507,Old man behind the counter a bit saucy and masagonistic but they helped my friend and for us on our way.
14508,"Use the Sonic app...allows you to pull up to a pick up slot, and you can get it and head out quickly!"
14509,Food was okay but they charge for corn tortillas which is part of the dish that was ordered and no Mexican restaurant charges for corn tortillas.
14510,"It wasn't busy like it normally is..we went there around 11-ish.  I like how they have the furniture more in the middle than towards the back and all the furniture is together like the lamps, beds and bed frames."
14511,Love the rocket ship play area. Pass by on my bike every time
14512,"This mall has seen better days (as all malls have). There is no reason for me to visit this mall. The movie theater has limited seating... there is no anchor department store (sans Best Buy)... and even when the summer days are hot and air conditioning is desired, it's not working or not working well...

The options for food here are lacking.

This mall is, however, clean and maintained. (The reason for the second star)"
14513,Nice guys and cheap 1/8ths
14514,A great place to visit and the people here ride bikes and workout. You can also go fishing here but overall a clean park.
14515,Always fun
14516,"The food,service,and staff are awesome!"
14517,Small but efficient airport in the northern most point of the US. TSA is never very long and AK Airlines is always friendly.
14518,"Best little shopping strip with a variety of stores...dentist, coffee shop, tea shop , bookstore."
14519,"Best Thai place in Kenai, Soldotna area...better then the Thai food trucks too. Plus I've never had bad service or problems with take out from them."
14520,Decent food very polite service.
14521,Nice and spicy wings always do take out.  A noisy place here.  But if you like that's it's perfect for you
14522,"Our family's favorite restaurant with Vegan,  Vegetarian options all day. The coffee here is amazing! A must if you are visiting Anchorage."

14534,Great selection of new and used records and super friendly people.
14535,Excellent as always!
14536,"This place is very quant. Run by what appears to be a small Thai family. Good prices, though maybe not the best pricing in town for Thai food. ~$15 for a bowl of curry, chicken with rice.

The interior is very cute and has a fun rustic feel with tons of exposed wood."
14537,Can't go wrong with Papa Murphy's they treat you right and eating is a delight.
14538,A cute little restaurant that I've driven by a million times. So glad I stopped by. I had the queen tostada. It was outstanding. I'll definitely be back.
14539,"Food is great, cookies are amazing"

14542,Great Place
14543,Great place to wait while you order pizza from Marco T
14544,Canned food but okay if you don't mind
14545,Awesome store
14546,"20 minute wait for water, tea that tasted/looked like dirt suspended in water, severely undercooked risotto and a finally of an overcooked steak.   It looked like the medium rare steak was cooked first because the herb butter had melted and dried on the steak.  Everything is overpriced.  The only complement my wife had was the food‚Äôs presentation was nice.   In my opinion, they are trying too hard and the kitchen staff cannot execute the menu.

After waiting forever for our food, the server told us we had 10 minutes to finish our coffee and dessert.  Due to the slow service we could not even have a conversation after dessert before the 1.5 hour time limit expired.

We requested help help from other servers more than we talked to our own server.  The response we got was, we‚Äôll tell your server.  All-in-all, our first experience will be our last."
14547,My boyfriend spends too much money here. It's better than a strip club.  So I'm happy.
14548,A pretty nice place to watch movies in anchorage of my choice
14549,"There were a few items, other that I was shopping for, that were not in-stock. This was obvious due to the gaping holes left on the stock shelves. I had no issue with finding and obtaining what I came for.
Walmart appears to be heading towards a cashless exchange system. They provide fewer and fewer actual checkers as time goes on. There are ""Scan-n-Go"" check-out  lanes a-plenty for those with debit or credit cards. Presently, this leads to standing in line for those not in-the-know."
14550,Purple turt leak???? LOL Jk jk you guys did a great job even got the Gummy bears out of hibernation under the back seat!
14551,"Good food, not spicy at all."
14552,"Great food wonderful serving staff, Skylar!"
14553,It's a Walmart.  What more is there to say
14554,Always served with a smile. Great way to start the day.
14555,"Help was great for a clueless Mom, had everything on my gear list."
14556,It's a dock with no services for tourists
14557,Always love this place. Went twice on out last homer trip. Wonderful friendly bartenders and the people are always great conversation.  Must go!
14558,The milkshakes here are a must try. I love that the menu has a few different things on it so that if you want to eat lighter cheaper meal you can and if you want to go all in you can as well.
14559,"Very busy in there and they swiftly and perfesionately got me in and out.  Very professional
."
14560,The service was great but the food was mediocre-poor.  My wife and i ordered appetizers( crab cakes and nachos). The nachos had a bad after taste after eating each bite and the chips were horrible. The crab cakes are like sliders and it felt as if was drowned in the dry coleslaw. I took the crab cakes and ate it by itself. The bread for the sliders were overbearing. The bread was bigger than the crab cake proportion so i took the bread edges off.  We didn't finish our appetizers so we ordered food.  I had the prime rib which was a special and what seemed a staple i was told there. The prime rib was dry and was well done. I requested it medium rare. I dared not to try the dessert given our previous meals. My wife ordered a salad and was afraid to try anything else given how the appetizers were. The salad was good. I can tell you the drinks were good and the waitress kept my alcohol topped off so eating my food was manageable. Im willing to try again but not too soon. Maybe in the future and my review may change.
14561,Chicken strip sandwich for the win
14562,"We‚Äôve had multiple visits and we‚Äôve always had excellent food & service. As for the views and setting, just look at the posted pictures. After dining, go for a walk, visit the Art Galleries, view the lagoon. Very worth the visit."
14563,"It's spotty with other national franchises, but this is the better village inn in town. Food isn't all that tasteful, but the atmosphere makes up for it. When you can spend hours in a place visiting with friends and even playing jenga, while not blowing the bank, you have me sold!"
14564,Fun to hangout and explore.
14565,Love the dog park.b
14566,Great spot for sushi
14567,"I always buy my furniture at Bailey's. They always have a friendly staff that do not hover over you or make you feel pressured in any way. Their prices are great and i love not having to wait for a sale, as their prices are the same all the time."
14568,Really nice mountain view
14569,Always friendly people
14570,First time eating here. Food was a bit slow to arrive but well worth the wait. I had the Reuben with Onion Rings and it was fantastic!
14571,Being local we typically go sit in the bar area it's a nice ambiance and the menu is reasonably priced. Our kids are six and three and we find the bar area very accommodating.the waitresses and waiters are great in the cocktails are good!!
14572,YK Delta is an incredible place to see.
14573,Good food. Lots of parking.
14574,24 hours. Very fast and friendly service. Often crowded.
14575,Shop around you'll find better shoes better prices
14576,"The good is decent, but the kitchen staff could use some hair nets. Seriously, keep your hair out of my food."
14577,The lobster bisque is such a delight.
14578,"Mainly for homeless people, and people who come from smaller villages. And, people who lost their homes."
14579,It's the usual service for the local subways in the area. I mean service is always great & its always clean and fresh. If there's ever any problem (witch almost never happens)they're quick and overly happy to fix . Only down fall is sometimes they're under manned so once in a while you might wait a minute or so but its worth it!!
14580,"Great place to start with if you're on a budget, and don't want an apartment."

14582,"Great off-leash dog park with beautiful lake and trails. Heavily wooded areas are great for off-trail adventures. Friendly folks and pets that are all generally responsible with clean-up. Lots of open areas for chuck-it and fetch and swimming. Just be careful of beavers! Especially when they've had their kits - very aggressive and there have been attacks on swimming dogs when they feel their nest is threatened. Occasional moose spottings, but generally very safe park year-round for walks, playtime, and socializing with other dogs of all varieties."
14583,"Beautiful, stunning, and majestic. A requirement of any visitor to Alaska."
14584,Too expensive and forget about if you have an impound
14585,Very knowledgeable staff. Good selection of quality CBD products at reasonable prices.
14586,When using credit card a compulsory min 15% tip comes up on bill. No offer for less if service was just average. Otherwise servings good and value ok
14587,Lisa is awesome
14588,Friendly
14589,The decor and food are amazing and the view of the mountain is breathtaking i highly suggest visiting this place
14590,Great place to get stuff for your outdoor activities üòÅ
14591,Getting tired of always having the wrong damn parts for for me waiting two days for them to find out it's the wrong part that the one that I needed was right there on the Shelf when I was their first time this really pisses me off
14592,Great shop to stop at for souvenirs of AK. A ways out from Fairbanks but worth trip. They also have an ice cream spot in the store.
14593,They fired walter!! Best decision they could of made

14599,Beautiful
14600,Great adult candy store
14601,"Feeling satisfied and hungry after my road trip to Homer, I enjoyed a very nice lunch and decided to visit Seward, before returning to Anchorage. Feeling a bit sleepy after a good meal I needed coffee to wake me up --- the usual gas station coffee does not appeal to me, so I stopped at a drive in coffee shop in Soldotna, on Route 1(Sterling Hwy). The young woman was eager to please my coffee craving and suggested mochaccino with hazelnut ... That hit the spot and put a smile on my face, now I was ready to continue my road trip  enjoying the beauty of the Alaskan countryside one last time before my midnight flight back to the East coast."
14602,"Big store for a handful of goods.  Does it really need a full wall display for three styles of panties? I'd have to say no.
That said I do like the clothing.  The quality is good and even the underwear I bought from the wall display are now some of my favorites."
14603,Lotsa stuff...no wind chime kits
14604,Nice break area on the Seward highway
14605,Always nice to see Alaska from the sky
14606,"The front desk ladies were very helpful. Parking is located behind the building from where google drops you off. Also, there is lodging on the Air Force side and the Army side. However the 'front desk is on the Air Force side. Rooms are large with ample area for storing baggage. However no separation between sleeping area and living room area."
14607,"Sopapilla's are really good. Recommend them to anyone.   The rest was ok. Not bad, but not great.  But I'd order takeout of just the sopapilla for dessert."
14608,"Long wait, got almost every part of the order wrong. Cold food, wrong drinks, asked for doing sauce, received none. Unfriendly service. Take a look at the picture at how little sauce is on the chicken sandwich and only one sad little pickle."
14609,"Had the philly cheesesteak sandwich, very good! Fries were well seasoned and crisp. Great service!"
14610,"Great food, fantastic service, and a great price. Super friendly staff and super tasty eats!"
14611,"Attentive, caring staff, wonderful thorough experience, wanted to make sure i was good overall and went above and beyond to make sure i had anything i needed."
14612,The most expensive grocery store. Open 24hrs though and it is clean. Prepared foods are good and reasonably priced.
14613,"Classic switch tactic..Wasted over an hour just to get tires that I've owned but were stored, changed out with current tires that are showing severe tire wear (steel wire showing), only to be told by the arrogent owner that because my 2nd pair of tires were 12 years old they wouldnt install them.

He then tried to sell me on buying a new set for $250 (how convenient)..."
14614,Very nice theater but is a bit pricey
14615,Great place for breakfast!üòâ
14616,Nice grocery store. Produce is good and they have a hot food serving section for take home dining.

14620,"Paid over $70 for Lomi to go, and other food, treated rudely, the Lomi had 2 pieces of small fish and the rest is tomatoes?!? The rice is dry and so is the Chicken Katsu, very disappointed for the price, would not go here..."

14626,Beautiful views excellent paved trails and frequent wildlife viewing opportunities. A must see for Anchorage visitors.
14627,"A little pricey, but good product and excellent service."
14628,"If your looking for just regular party stuff I guess this place is fine , but if your looking for specific children themes they have nothing from this decade."
14629,"When I was a child, I remember going here with my grandmother and cousins. The pizza was predictably decent, the place was dark and full of wood paneling and the like in that fashion from the time. I remember being in high school and dropping a couple of quarters in a video game machine there in the lobby while waiting for my pizza.

I went here recently, with my granddaughter and my husband. The EXACT SAME VIDEO GAME was still in the lobby. The paneling was still there. The old bench seats from when I was a child? Still there. Everything was a little bit darker because, you know, age and all. Decades of dust, regardless of how well tended, had darkened the upholstery on the top of the seats.

The waiter was surprised that anybody was walking in for food. He nonetheless was very friendly and helped us come up with an affordable order of food. When the pizza came out, it was still predictably decent, a good, standard Pizza Hut pizza.

I guess they get points for nostalgia and retro and all, and I cannot fault them for anything. But this is a really good location, and it deserves a bit of an update, instead of looking like a run down ""after"" set for a time travel movie."
14630,Fast
14631,Best biscuits and gravy in Anchorage. The bacon strips are perfection as well.
14632,"Ate a great lunch here today..everything you could ask for: reasonably priced, delicious Guatemalan tacos with home made tortillas is what I had.  The setting is very comfortable adjacent to  the store. I love it when I purchase something delicious and feel happy knowing the money is well spent.  Check it out for lunch on Tuesdays! You will be sooo happy you did."

14647,"Great selection, good prices. Checkout lines can be long at peak times, as expected. Deli food ok."
14648,Super great food! I've been going here since I was younger. Very friendly staff and down home cooking! Everyone in the valley must feel the same because some days you will be waiting an hour for a table!! Most find it worth it though!
14649,The staff was so eager to answer my kids questions and make sure they enjoyed the animals and learned something
14650,3 stars because service is good. Food is bland though. Pizza looks good but unfortunately we didn't have the pizza. I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and meat balls. Wife said hers was bland also (seafood stuffed Halibut) Stuffing is pureed all together to a point that you couldn't tell what was in it. We spent $135 plus 20$ tip dollar for 4 meals and 2 appetizers.  All in all I could have cooked a better meal at home. Also took 1 hour 20 min to get our meal.
14651,"Their pizza is ok, Alaska doesn't have a great standard for food"
14652,Judy was very helpful and knowledgeable in all the ways to select the right mattress for the way you sleep. She has been doing this for 30 years. Highly recommend her for your sleeping needs

14677,Wonderfully crafted pizza that will leave you wanting more.
14678,Love antiques...hard to not like but expensive on prices.
14679,"The rude counter employee owes the high quality cooks an apology. They were very busy on night of 10/5. The kitchen did an amazing job of producing high quality food quickly. The counter person was so angry at every customer that the person would not even look customers in the eye, mumbled payment instructions, and abandoned the register without providing any status information about the orders. I had to yell my name at the kitchen to claim my food because the counter person would not communicate with anyone.  Why have such high quality kitchen staff with a customer service agent who clearly hates us?"
14680,Our favorite trail to hike.  I'm amazed parking is free.
14681,"This particular Carrs is a mega-Carrs. In fact, I have yet to get over to the west end of the store. Clean with friendly people and a fantastic deli, I will drive across town to come to this location."

14698,Not a bad theater.  Never had a bad movie experience here.  I just wish that it didn't take 4 days to purchase tickets at the counter.  What is the problem??  Very slow service at the concession counter.  Worst around in my opinion.
14699,"WiFi as far as I could tell required signing up for Hilton rewards. Breakfast not free and rather expensive. I am honestly hard not to please, but the best I can say was the rooms were clean and Staff was very friendly. I just expect more from Hilton."

14708,"About a month ago we noticed a weird bump on our eight week old pup‚Äôs tummy.  After calling several clinics Ravenwood was the only one who wanted our pup to come in. The staff was wonderful, warm, and friendly. We‚Äôve seen several different doctors since then and they have all been encouraging and helpful.  They do not spit malarkey just to milk you for your money, if they don‚Äôt have an answer/suggestion they will not give it. I highly recommend taking your family fur member here."

14711,Great place for children's birthday parties! Fun and games!
14712,"Got a soft spot for this place. Washed my car here for the first time after my first trip up from the lower forty-eight. Kind of a rough neighborhood, but affordably priced, and much more efficacious than any drive through spot. I'll always remember getting rid of thousands of miles of road grime here in the cold rain with a homeless guy yelling invective at me. Doesn't sound good, but engenders genuine nostalgia now. A good place to experience the grittiness that is Anchorage."

14725,You never can get the right help hardly any of the staff speaks English they point you in the wrong direction they just guess At what you're asking then yes start pointing that's why I choose to shop at Fred Meyers over Walmart just because of this we are at a disadvantage trying to find direction in the store therefore he spend more time lost then he do shopping then my comes time to check out not enough  cashiers Especially around closing time I don't know if you pay your employees overtime due to the fact that they can't give out of the store until I half hour 45 minutes after you close a lot of thieves in the parking lot as well a lot of scum hanging out out front degen from money begging for cigarets it's quite a joke beautiful store I mean very very nice but yourMajority of customers are just like the Walmart videos

14741,"If you're traveling with your RV on a budget then the Fishing Hole Campground is a good choice.

Not much here for the RV, but you might find more cash in your pocket compared to other RV Parks.  The Fishing Hole Campground is located in a great spot on the Homer Spit because you're a walk away from a little of everything.  There are 80 sites here, so hopefully you'll find your lucky fishing RV spot.

Take a break from the day and walk next door to the Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon."

14801,Extremely polite hotel staff at check in. Can't say the same for the bar crew. Tended to serve other guest faster and more often. Need to be trained in customer service. All customers are important regardless of race or ethnicity. That's why I rate it a 3 Star and I'm being generous. Our group of 14 took note. Extremely better service at the Lake Front.

My order arrived 30 minutes AFTER it's original 45min wait AND the food wasn't even hot/warm. It's as if my food was sitting for awhile before I even got to enjoy it. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Was it worth the money or the wait?! Not at all. But the delivery driver was really polite tho. Give it a try yourself, everyone has different taste."

You can pick up things like squash, kale, beets, duck or chicken eggs, pink oyster mushrooms, luttuce, carrots, or even fresh baked breads or sweets. Show up early if you want eggs, that was the only thing I noticed selling out quickly. Lots of available parking and parking is free.

14917,"Just about every time I go into Western Auto I discover they carry something I didn't know they carry. Like, wait. Western Auto carries appliances? And there is a very decent if small selection of appliances. Wait... I can get a mouse for my laptop here? Holy smokes! I wish I'd known about their science kits for kids before Christmas! And that's just the bottom floor. There's a whole floor above of marine equipment and sporting goods that you could just wander around in for hours. Their prices are decent for Alaska. Service is always very good- you never have to look long for someone to help you find something.  So now if I'm on my way to Fred's or Home Depot for some household good, I check in at Western first, just to see. They don't always have what I need, (no SAD lamps!) but very often they do, and a decent or sometimes better price, probably a higher quality version, and with much better service.  I would rather give them my money!"
14918,"Darryl treats my grandmother, who has been a gardener here in Anchorage for over 40 years, with such respect. It is so nice to come to a place that will order in something that you haven‚Äôt been able to find! They have gorgeous plants and I never see chickweed in their pots (unlike Bell‚Äôs nursery!). I truly enjoy their indoor plant selection and their seed towers as well. But everything here is top notch!"
14919,This place has really good skillets and you can even smoke here if that's what your into.

Thanks to Max for making the experience of buying another car a little less painful. Very happy!"

14941,"It's a giant warehouse club with limited selection which only varies by season.  Good produce, meat, and premade dinners from the deli.  Forget about buying anything in reasonable sizes, but if need a gallon of mayo or pickles this is your store.  Also, plan on being stuck here for at least an hour to wind through the turn-style-like layout.  You have to go all the way to back to get to the fresh food section."

When you walk in the cafe looks pretty nice, the menu items sound delicious. The actual food.... nope. I ordered a chicken sandwich. I could see it was burnt when the waitress brought it out and as soon as she set the plate down I told her it was. She looked at me like I was crazy and told me that it was not burnt..... when everyone at my table looked at the chicken they looked back at her like she was crazy and agreed that what she brought WAS burned (I did not order any blackened or BBQ chicken) she seemed annoyed and said that She would ask if the chicken could be remade and then asked if it could not be made would I want something different. I asked that I would like what I ordered without the burned chicken and if it could only come out burned then I did not need anything. She came out to let us know that the chicken would be remade. This 2nd sandwich was not burned I took a bite and a friend of mine took a bite only to be grossed out by the smell. If they will let you I suggest ordering from the kids menu (if you can't make it to a different place or home to cook that is)I can't recall the exact name of the sandwich  but ultimately I received smelly fried chicken on a decent bun that included Cole slaw and caramelized onions with pickles hot sauce on the side. Took one bite and ended up only eating the cole slaw, my friend ate a quarter of the bun and we left it there.... I will never go back to actually eat here. I can't say that the waitress was terrible (I tipped her well even thought it was not without a turn in my stomach doing so) but she was not great either as I've never had a waitress argue about something that was so clear as burned chicken, to myself and the rest of the people at my table. The salad is nothing special but edible, the fries are fine. None of it though is worth the price you will pay once the bill arrives Oh yeah, and the ketchup is gross."

14975,First time trying to use one. Audio instructions were inaudible inside the car. Visual instructures were confusing. In the end it sprayed only half our car once leaving it as dirty as it was when we entered. A complete waste if $15.

Every  shop in Anchorage such as Costco is booked until the end of November 2018.  I found a screw in my tire a couple of weeks prior and it began seriously leaking.  This shop fixed my tire in 30 minutes.  Jamie was super professional and quite cute to :)  First come first serve is the best!"

14994,A must have for any visit to anchorage
14995,"THEY RECENTLY MOVED ALL THE AISLES AROUND, SO IF YOU HAD THEM MEMORIZED FOR A QUICK IN AND OUT TRIP, DREAM ON.  MOST OF THE STAFF IS HELPFUL THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR, MARLENA BAVILLA, IF SHE IS THERE GO TO HER LINE SHE'S AWESOME.

15019,All the employees were outside smoking
15020,One of the best restaurants in town
15021,"For concerts, it's definitely echoey compared to the Alaska Airlines Center. For UAA sports (now that the Aces have left), it's frequently empty enough that you can sit wherever and be pretty sure nobody will tell you to move (so you can buy whatever the cheapest tickets are and move)."
15022,Garcias has a great family friendly environment and fantastic food. We will definitely be returning soon.

15028,Love it very friendly

15031,Very nice atmosphere and the food is really good
15032,Great service!
15033,Very interesting!
15034,Loud guests and rooms do NOT all contain kitchens despite what is advertised.
15035,Good sub
15036,Not bad. The security people were nice. They stop boarding like 20-30 mins before the flight so make sure you're there early to check in bags and go through security. There can be a pretty long line sometimes.
15037,Best fish and chips in the WORLD!! (The beer is great too)
15038,ok
15039,"If you pick the right meal for your portion it's exactly what you're asking for. Staff was amazing, food was beyond delicious."

15049,Century 16 is a good movie theatre.  They like to keep the place clean and the equipment maintained.  Not all of their theatres are equal in upkeep but they are all satisfactory.
15050,All in all a bad place to eat. Always have bad services ice there
15051,"Incredible service! If anyone was thinking of something more to eat or drink, the waitress was already there waiting to take the order!
And yet it was Very Private!
There were 18 to 20 people in our party, and no one else In our area. We could not even see anyone else from our tables!
Creative and tasty selections of Pizza and of Beer! Salads were ""make your own""!
Our Hosts were quite Gracious too!
Go see for yourself!"
15052,"My husband and I stopped by The Wild Catch Cafe during a trip to Alaska in July 2019. We ordered a cup of fresh clam chowder to share as an appetizer and it was the best I've ever had. I ordered the salmon burger which I expected to be a patty of pressed salmon, but it was actually a fresh plank of the best salmon I could imagine. My husband ordered the fresh halibut and it was so great! It had fresh house made tarter sauce that paired perfectly with it. We both loved our meals so much, we halved them with each other so we could each have both!"
15053,Pretzels are amazing!! Love the chicken salad pretzel sandwich. Great ranch and fries!!
15054,nice place
15055,"I am with the other reviewers.  If I could give a zero, I would.  So I read the reviews, but had to go anyway because they are my neighborhood post office.  The only clerk working, (i will leave out names), his nametag said that he was the Lead Postal Clerk.  How can a ""lead"", not answer very basic questions?  I told him that we do not receive mail delivery in my neighborhood, how would I go about getting mail delivered?  He said, I dont know, I guess you could rent a PO box.  I asked if there was any other way?  He said no.  I asked about a cluster box.  He told me ok, but to get one, I had to track down the mail carrier to get a key.
Really?  So you expect me to  somehow find and track down the mailman in the middle of his route, and they are supposed  to have the key?  I dont buy  that.  Now searching for some kind of supervisor who can help me."
15056,Good food and great fun!
15057,Shawn was recommended by a friend. He didn't work on my vehicle but only because it was a major job replacing a clutch and he was honest about turnaround time with all his other repairs. He gave me a recommendation of where to take it. I WILL be taking my other business back to him. Super nice guy.
15058,Not consistent in food preparation.
15059,Best food and beer ever but long wait best to make a reservation.
15060,Large alcohol selection and specialty candy selection
15061,No back to school clothes or shoes. Horrible selection.
15062,Good costumer service.
15063,i was on flying from the Arctic Circle. I needed a place close to airport. I had a flight out early the next morning. The shuttle picks up late a night. They delivered my back to the airport early the next morning. The staff was accommodating
15064,I was never there!!
15065,"Waste of money. Trashy place. If I were a kid, I'd be offened."
15066,It's Walmart -- not run down and it's not Target.
15067,"(Translated by Google) Very friendly service. Prices rather high but adequate.

(Original)
Sehr freundliche Bedienung. Preise eher hoch jedoch angemessen."
15068,"Nice little gem with walking path, tables and exercise play equipment"
15069,"Great food all around awesome environment and staff just expect to pay more than fast food, even though it is fast!"
15070,Worth every penny. The naan and lamb curry is to die for!
15071,M6 food was burned and they still handed me the bill it was black and it shouldn't get a star
15072,Always an amazing dine I love their home made breads and fresh ingredients will always go back!
15073,Love the new cinnamon brioche. So good!
15074,"Wide selection, decent sales and clothing options."
15075,It's McDonald's. Lol
15076,Every spring I order the fish sandwiches at Arby's at least once a week.  They have the best fish sandwiches in the fast food world.

15078,Went and had a beautiful view and peacefull
15079,"Professional, on time , clean.  Good easy access location.  Completely happy with my MRI experoence including extra paddin on my ears, over the ear plugs!"

15087,The shrimp cocktail (cold) and the chicken soup are my go-to dishes. I mix it up with seafood enchiladas and chili relleno entrees.
15088,We ate breakfast and dinner here after numerous locals recommended South. The breakfast was definitely our favorite. The staff was wonderful and charming and the ambiance is warm and comfortable. Will be a regular when we visit.
15089,Just not my kind of place.
15090,This is the worst subway I've been to for customer service. I try not to go here.

15097,Yummy
15098,"Great food, and lots of beer! Very cozy atmosphere in comparison to some of the other places on the drive from Fairbanks to Anchorage. Unfortunately we timed out visit the same as others and it took over an hour and 20 mins to get our food."
15099,Food's good. Service could be a little better. Still my favourite thai food place in Fairbanks.
15100,"Very good food, lovely mixture of cuisines"

15103,Great little bar.... definitely a local bar feel.
15104,Great place very helpful people
15105,Delicious food and great service. Got my own catch-of-the-day cooked and couldn't have asked for better!
15106,"Excellent food and service (I recommend the Eggs Benedict) and a solid coffee selection. Parking is around the corner and very easy to find. Once you‚Äôre inside, the atmosphere is classic coffeehouse and very inviting."
15107,They have a couple of the most knowledgeable aquarium guys and a good staff in general.
15108,Always have the best birthday parties there!
15109,Hard to get seating in the evenings if you have a laptop and need power.
15110,Clean and comfortable shop.
15111,I spend waaaaay too much money here...But they always have what you need
15112,"Had exactly what we needed, and IN STOCK. Kristi was super friendly & knowledgeable. Great experience after a huge letdown at another furniture store. Wish we had gone here first!"
15113,Nice place
15114,They are so helpful and knowledgeable
15115,"(Translated by Google) Great head roll

(Original)
Great cinn roll"
15116,Service was fabulous. I did however have to wait 45 minutes past my appointment time. It would have been longer if I  had not brought it to clerks attention.
15117,"I've been taking my dog(s) there for medical visits and boarding for many years now. I love the competancy of the doctors and aides, and the customer service and friendliness of all the staff is wonderful. It's costly but in line with other vets here in AK. As we all know, everything costs too much in this state. I highly recommend them."
15118,"Never see same medical professional 2x, non-definative diagnosis, its confusing. Will shop around..N."
15119,Always feel the people here treat me well.
15120,Usually really full any day of the week I like to just get the takeout and go home and eat it in the food's always good

15127,"The view is awesome of the harbor. The place was very clean and pleasant to stay in. The breakfast bar is decent with pancakes made to order. The breakfast really helped as there isn't many places around to get food that early. Parking is a little bit of an issue, but there's a huge free parking lot across the street. Make sure to check out the Otter's back in the docks!!!"
15128,Went to the Oaken barrel good selection of Alaskan micro brews. Seems groceries are more expensive in Alaska but the beer and liquor are cheeper in comparison to Virginia anyway.
15129,Great customer service.
15130,Went on a fishing trip and this is where we docked.
15131,Beautiful

15133,"Great place to spend the day, folks are friendly the museum is interesting"
15134,Food was terrific but service was slooow. Server dropped a pile of checks and asked us to pass them out to others in our party. Sat 30 minutes waiting for a wrap and water. Get better 49th State...Tourist season is coming!!!
15135,This place was super cool and their drinks amazing!!
15136,"Delicious Korean rice bowls, just the sight of the order before yours being prepared will have you asking 'ooohhh, what is that one!?'

-1 because many tables needed to be wiped down when we were ready to be seated. The food was so good I feel bad taking off a star though!

We demand a South Anchorage location!"
15137,Waited nearly an hour for a cheese pizza and when it finally came out it had hair in it.
15138,"Always a fun time, lift lines go fast and the runs are decent for it being a hill, lift loading and unloading areas need work, on the load there's a huge mound that causes you to have to lift your board super high to not scrape and the offload alway has bad bumps and ruts."
15139,"The bake goods are fresh, and tasty."
15140,Was a fun little spit to stop at along highway.  Nice walking paths.  Huge inside gift shop
15141,"Clean, spacious, great location."
15142,This is a great place to grab a quick bite. I had a cheesesteak crepe. The wait was not long. It was very good. The staff were very friendly. Prices were a little high otherwise would have 5 starred them. Oh and there desserts are delicious aswell.
15143,We really like Cold Spot Feed. My little dog Boo gets to go in and shop and the people just love the animals that come in. They're very helpful with foods for the picky eaters and the clothes and toys are great.
15144,Awesome place
15145,Fast and courteous
15146,Mushroom & Swiss burger....YUM
15147,Always a fun time at Four Corners/Spurs Bar
15148,A quaint aquarium for a good family time.
15149,Great food
15150,Big open grass for bbq or kick ball. Little kid playground with soft padding underneath so they don‚Äôt get hurt if they fall. There are Two trash cans to clean up afterwards and two picnic tables To enjoy lunch/snack with kiddos.
15151,"TRY EVERYTHING ONCE. This place is AWESOME. Not ONE time in the many times have I been here, have I ever been disappointed. Expect that from big chains. Not at Frostbite. Done right every single time. Bring an appetite and a couple of friends or family. You'll love this space."
15152,Amazing scenery! We got to experience from our cruise ship!
15153,Food was great and service was even better

15160,Huge breakfast for your buck and very friendly and prompt staff.
15161,"I have lived in Fairbanks my entire life and I have always been treated right by the staff at Aurora.  My pup recently broke his leg and they were able to get him in immediately.  They are prompt, knowledgeable and easy on the pockets.  True animal lovers!"
15162,Good food. Definitely can fill up here. Prices are a bit high and seating can be tricky when they're busy...and they're always busy. But worth the wait.
15163,Well I gave 4 stars just because I work there and I'm used to the customers
15164,So many dogs to play with!
15165,Best liquor store in town! Ha!
15166,Is good is cheap is right next to work
15167,"Staff is USUALLY good, selection of vape juice is lacking, but they do make their own for you."

15169,"The servers are very nice and friendly. The food is great, came out nice and hot."
15170,Great organics
15171,Bria is a masterful massage therapist. The administrator is also really well informed about insurance.
15172,High prices. The pizza was just ok. It was bland I really expected more. The pizza came to our table warm had to send it back who wants to eat a warm flavorless pizza. I took the pizza home it smelled bad I think it was the cheese they used. Seated in a weird area this restaurant has a table with couches which was odd. They had plenty of other tables. If you want a hot pizza for a decent price you may as well go to costco. They advertise as the best pizza rated by some magazine I think it may have been the case in the 80s-90s when they first opened up.
15173,Good food!
15174,Usually not great service. Which is weird because it‚Äôs never that busy. Food it decent.
15175,"Great, friendly service."
15176,Always stay here when I'm in town
15177,Service kinda sucks
15178,"The ice museum was beautiful and so cold I loved it and the kids enjoyed it as well, the hot springs was fabulous as well very relaxing would be even better in wintertime but the pool on the other hand looked awful I wouldn't step foot in it"
15179,Cranky Turkey on prairie all the way.
15180,Nice place
15181,It's a quick stop if you are busy they get your food out in 15 minutes or less depending on the time of day you go in
15182,"I have adored the complex combinations of the same 30 ingredients for the last 20 years, all I can say is portion control. I loath getting the shorted on my portions. Please stop shrinking my bean burrito!!! 3oz scoop of beans"
15183,Friendly staff. Good prices. If you go after 8pm they're not to many check stands open it seems like. Avoid welfare day.
15184,Finger licking chicken and texas toast what's not to love about thatü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
15185,Always there to help me celebrate or mourn.
15186,its Olive Garden haha
15187,"Place was busy, I think maybe they were short staffed it took about 25 mins for our order, it was small and crowded, covid is on the rise so mandatory masks signs were up but not everyone followed suit, the workers didn't seem to mind. I also order halibut and it was most definitely not, I'm sure it was cod,  the order was small for a hefty price tag of 18 and some change. The decor and merchandise were awesome to look at on a plus side"
15188,I love this store. I took my brother there to help him buy professional attire. He had never been in the store before. The staff were helpful in sticking within his budget and finding clothes that fit him well.
15189,ALWAYS GOOD SERVICE.
15190,My first time eating at Kriner's and adding to my regular list. Had breakfast and it was great. Large portions and the best pancakes I've ever had.
15191,"Downtown restaurant clean well lightened. Food was good and service was friendly.  Prices were a bit expensive,  but over all a good time was had.."
15192,Nice place. Very quiet.
15193,"Nice small place, but I hear Wednesdays are incredibly busy"
15194,Ulisses is a highly professional worker he was able to help me with my phone and it was fixed. Thank you.
15195,"Walmart of pets, idk kinda creeps me out personally.  They ran out of crickets when I was there."
15196,"The new tasting room is amazing with a great atmosphere, delicious food, and large selection of drinks! Check it out!"
15197,"Seem to always look for service as workers are walking around, but don't ask if I've been helped."
15198,So delicious! People complained they were out of some food. I think It‚Äôs amazing to think they can get food to a restaurant in such a remote location. We‚Äôre so lucky! The meals were delicious and it‚Äôs a fun environment.
15199,"They sell guns, gun parts, and ammo what more do you need to know?"
15200,Family store and atmosphere
15201,Tried calling TWICE to cancel my order for today's delivery at 645 pm..due to work schedule they never answered my call!  If the delivery show up and I'm not home to retrieve my order!  Hey I called twice at 12:25 pm and 12:27! NO answer so...
15202,Great place. Excellent service from Justin when I needed a new tire! Always fast with the oil changes as well.
15203,Excellent hot and sour soup
15204,Awesome place
15205,Perfect tourist attraction. Plus ice cream!
15206,"Great hair cut, fair price, and a hot towel to boot."
15207,A pleasant looking mall. Bigger than I thought it would be compared to 5th Avenue mall. We enjoyed walking around the different gift shops. We bought quite a few things from the different stores here.
15208,The RV wand was plugged lost $3. Thankfully my camper fit through the pull through. Won't go there again want too much money for too little time.
15209,Good prices and low crime compared to Bragaw Costco this year.
15210,"I don't recommend climbing when it's raining, hailing & storming. It can be scary, especially for children.There isn't any protection from the elements in these conditions. Mud & water were running down the mtn & we had to wait until the storm subsided before proceeding down the trail. It was slick in some areas & we noticed some 'stairs' or, rail ties were lose on the trail."
15211,"Wait staff was pushy with the gaming cards, then they lost our order (computer error supposedly).   After waiting over an hour they realized this.   To their credit the manager came and apologized and comped our meal.  Food then took another hour and one person's meal came out like another 15 mins after that.   Food was pretty bad.   Like Applebee's on a bad microwave day bad.   I really want to give them 2 stars since they comped the meal which was stand up, but even free it wasn't worth it.   If you want to play games I am sure it is great, but we never got to that point as dinner took so long."
15212,"The selection seemed fairly limited, but it smelled wonderful."
15213,"Good food, good service."
15214,"No thrills burger and Chinese food place with small drive thru. Your coming for the food, which is pretty darn good and well priced."
15215,fast food
15216,"Expensive, but the customer service and quality of my interaction was stellar!"
15217,Had a most wonderful night thereüòå
15218,What can I say for a quick bite.... : ) the cinnamon twists weird...
15219,Nice to get out in nature and relax on a beautiful day!
15220,Always a solid choice in Anchorage for food and drinks
15221,The store is great but there prices are a little higher than Petco or Amazon with free shipping on  Amazon my dog food is $10 cheeper. I do like the store if your looking for a good deal it's not at the animal warehouse
15222,"I, didn't   walk, to much, inn. I, just were sitting down. Looking some information, with, my cell."
15223,"Friendly staff, great place to play. Kids love it!"
15224,Yum!!!
15225,Mary rocks! I refuse to go to anyone else
15226,Very friendly and helpful staff and the nicest showroom in Fairbanks.
15227,Good service decent coffee good place to drop in to get your coffee fix
15228,Orange Shakes are the best!
15229,"It‚Äôs a nice restaurant, friendly and fast service, big portions, clean"
15230,"Thank you Denali  ATV Adventures for helping us create unforgettable memories. We took the 9 pm tour and had an exhilarating 2 hour adventure to the tops of mountains, through the mud, and down to the river. The kids never stopped smiling and that's the best."
15231,"Amazing spot for great views, mushroom hunting, and playing in the falls on hot days. Standard parking fees for day use.  Not a camp site."
15232,friendly staff huge selection
15233,Its the best. Clam Chowder Fridays!
15234,Great hike
15235,"Highly recommend reservations because it's one of the top notch places in town. It's pricey for sure but the food and service can't be beat. The food is perfectly prepared, elegantly presented and they treat you like Queens and Kings. My bisque was delectable but everything I've ever had here is scrumptious."
15236,We love this store! The staff is always so friendly and helpful.
15237,"Amazing staff and owner is a real sweetheart. Some patrons can tend to be rude but the owner shuts them down when she notices.

Good stock and fair prices."
15238,They had my belt.
15239,Always good had Grilled Chicken Sandwiches & water!
15240,GREAT TIME ALWAYS WITH ALL 3 OF MY KIDS! ALWAYS
15241,Total dive bar with lack luster food.
15242,"We brought a friend for lunch here. Had the beef tenderloin hash, a Danish specialty, and the flourless chocolate cake. Both were very good. The service, however, was over the top excellent. Our server answered all our questions about the menu and was continually checking on us to make sure all was well. Overall, a very nice experience."
15243,"Fantastic, magical place. Worth every penny for the flight. We walked up on one sow within 30 feet. First boots on the ground mid May and we saw over a dozen brown bears. Right as we were leaving a large boar came by chasing a sow and her cub. Barely saw us. Wear high water boots and be ready to tromp around a bit. Certainly a top 2 highlight of our Alaska adventures."
15244,"So expensive, I will never shop here again.  I can get twice the amount of groceries at Fred Meyer."
15245,"Did a land cruise with royal Caribbean and didn't get the chance to see any other animals besides lots of wild moose. Getting up close and personal with grizzleys, black bears, wolf's, caribou, yak, Ravens, foxs, eagles, was really fun and neat. Animals had plenty of room to run and enjoy their home. Support this awesome place. Views for days."
15246,Good place to take tourist
15247,The Jim buger is the best
15248,They have good coffee out front...
15249,Friendly staff excellent variety of services! Very happy!
15250,No place to park
15251,Great selection!
15252,One of the best (only) places to shop in Anchorage!  Always seems a little understaffed.
15253,Very informative you are able to view many aquatic birds and animals you don't normally get close to.
15254,Got broken car
15255,Top ramen tastes better. I really regret taking my wife's family here based on the rating. I've never been more dissatisfied with food. Please stop searing one two sides of the steamed gyoza.
15256,Very nice store
15257,Great service and great food and drinks
15258,"Very well stocked, they had everything I was looking for except for pro release clips that i use on my downriggers."
15259,Beautiful place with loads of activities. Staff really pleasant and very helpful. Lovely treks to do with just amazing scenery! Take water with you as the treks are quite hard going but worth it. This is just like a little bit of paradise!
15260,At the end I was disappointed but the courteous staff made me happy when I left
15261,"Afabulous location. Get a harbor view room and watch harbor seals, sea lions and sea otters from your room.
But please improve your breakfast offerings."
15262,Great place to visit late at night :)
15263,Best pizza I've had in year's
15264,Was a tad expensive. Guess all pizza places are. But I'm was actually surprised by the quality. Would choose it again
15265,"Always great breakfast, so it is almost always busy and can be difficult to get a table without a wait. But, it is completely worth it, every time I have been!"
15266,"This place is so unorganized. Had to wait 20 minutes for my ""fast"" food. The lack of direction and management is the only reason for it."
15267,Nice price and clean
15268,Awesome prices. Got so much for the money!
15269,Thanks for the fast friendly service! 19 min flight new record!
15270,A very close friend and I decided to have a late nite picnic which consisted of Taco Bell and some quality conversation.  Great place if I can say one thing be careful after park hours and please help maintain our parks and help pitch in to keep Alaska Wild
15271,Fast and Curtisly served and great music
15272,"Quick service, friendly staff."
15273,There has been a major revitalization effort at this mall.  It could still use a few more options and you can't change the fact that it is right across the street from a huge trailer park.
15274,"Great beer, great place!!  Only two bathrooms, tho"
15275,Pretty good. Ambiance isn't the best.
15276,Don't come here after lunch and expect fresh food in the buffet. It was ok; just not great.
15277,Very pleasant.  Work was sanitary and done with professionalism.
15278,I love this mall has everything I like
15279,"Just the worst retail establishment in the world unfortunately it's the basically the only retailer in the island. So if your looking for sub par items at an unreasonable price this is the place for you. Unless I need something immediately, and they will probably won't have what I need, I'll be sticking with Amazon or having a family member mail it to me in a flat rate box I'll trust them and the USPS any day over Walmart there terrible selection unfair prices and awful customer service. I hope management see this and makes changes but we all know that won't happen."
15280,"My favorite place in town to shop for clothes.
Prices are reasonable and there are always good deals.  There are higher end places but they have the higher end prices.  I enjoy having a diverse professional and casual wardrobe and not have to go to a bunch of places to find things."
15281,Like the price and service overall
15282,Excellent store for home repair.
15283,"Pretty good, I'd go again someday."
15284,The service herr is prompt and authentic. Good place.
15285,"In and out, no wait and the cut looks great!"
15286,"Everybody here is so helpful and friendly! They really start to feel like family! Have a rewards system, military discounts and some awesome product! Not to mention they are open 21 hours a day!"
15287,Long wait but worth every minute of it. Food is always on point!
15288,"Nice clean park that has 2 baseball fields,  walking, running and biking trails, a large open field for dogs and  a larger covered picnic area"
15289,"perfect portions of food, delicious jelly, great atmosphere, and wonderful customer service"
15290,Always good
15291,Nice theatre.
15292,Nice hotel - appears new and was clean.
15293,Fast friendly service!
15294,Makenzie was great!
15295,Now a days wgen you go through the drive thru the new normal has you swipe or insert your card while they hold the reader. When getting your food it's a sealed bag and they ask how menu sauces if any you want. And yes the count them. Be prepared and know how many you want they care specific. Food wise they are shorteningvtgere menu and they will no longer offer the one item I go there for whinmcjmh is the Nacho Bellgrande. So I guess no running to the border for me. Lol it was freshly made and tasted like it should. Cheers and adios Taco Bell.
15296,. Terribly run.
15297,"Friendly staff, easy to work with, made things understandable"
15298,"Somedays are awesome at Taproot, somedays not so much.  They bring in some excellent local (and foreign) talent.  I would always check the calendar.  The food is good and the beer selection is great.  Never loved what the open mic night brings out.  Also, I do not advise going here on the cold days as their heating system cannot compensate and you're left huddling near one of the space heaters."
15299,My go to place.
15300,"Wow...The views from this hotel are outstanding. We actually stayed in the Bear Cabin, which was adorable. The space was nice to spread out and unwind. The staff was accommodating and friendly. The wifi at the cabin/hotel is very good and efficient."
15301,"Great store, lots of things to check out!"
15302,I thought my heart had died
15303,"Best sandwiches in the valley, and I'd put them up there as one of the best in ALL OF ALASKA! HANDS DOWN. Love the fresh baked cookies they make as well. And the old school decorations and pictures they have are excellent piece to their name."
15304,Fantastic views
15305,Exceptionally great food!! A+++
15306,Cheese quesadilla was almost all tortilla .. bathrooms in bad shape
15307,Very helpful
15308,Go there when u need to laundry fast and affordable
15309,"One of the places I count on, and I've have done so for years.  Just one of the reasons - they have a program to replace the worn-out batteries in my remote start FOR LIFE üòç.  Now THAT is a WOW!"
15310,Great service. Had a Cheeseburger $6.75 and a Chocolate shake ordered a large shake found out it was 32oz and $7.15 changed it to a medium. The burger had the usual suspects lettuce tomato onion mayo and mustard ketchup average size nothing special. The shake was just that a shake didn't taste different but twice the price. Looked forward to the lunch it was hot fresh just a little spend. Still better than McDonald's burger. Not as good as Carl's in my opinion. I usually get the foot long and bring my own soda. Lol
15311,"Great food, good price, good service, MuST TAKE OUT in winter.... Inside is fairly cold... 50s..."
15312,A blast of flavors and large portions made this place top on my favorites list of best casual restaurants! The owner is very friendly and helpful. He asked how everything was and made sure I was satisfied. Be sure to try the Naan with your meal.
15313,"This place is always fun for the kids, but food is not that good. The food is always cold."
15314,3 words ...OH MY GOD!!!  Unbelievable beauty!
15315,Good food but pricey
15316,Expensive.
15317,This is my favorite restaurant in Anchorage I love the family that owns it I love their food they know me and my girlfriend and what we get every time almost occasionally we change it up but I enjoy going every time and I almost always have leftovers if you haven't gone if it's the last thing you do please go to Thai siam and enjoy a delicious meal
15318,The drive through cashiers always have unique personalities that make ordering on the go a little less mundane.
15319,Close to home and they have most everything.
15320,"Worst McD xp ever. Ice machine is broken, as usual.. got the wrong menu, they forgot the sauce, fries and drink.

Ol uncle MC is gettin tired"
15321,The salmon fest was fun but they should have been more clear when advertising because i had mistaken it to be the ninilchic fair with the animals and rodeo and all that fun stuff and was pretty disappointed to find out that it wasnt after we had already bought the 2 day tickets for 2 people
15322,Over priced drive through has gotten very slow.
15323,The membership truly unlocks some amazing prices. Great selection of everything. Customer service is top-notch.
15324,Very nice place to visit.
15325,Food is GREAT but it smells like an ashtray
15326,"This place has great sandwiches! I've gotten the half order with a salad and always had plenty of food (to the point I can't imagine what a whole sandwich would involve) twice now. The atmosphere is comfortable and contemporary, whether you're just there for breakfast, lunch, or an afternoon to study its a great spot. The servers have always been friendly and there's free wifi. Lots of vegetarian options as well."
15327,"Always, one of my first choices, for casual dinning."
15328,I stopped in looking for shoes for my son and they didn't have any in stock. What they did have was expensive. I ended up going to Wal-Mart and got 2 pairs for what I would have paid for one there. I don't plan on going back again.
15329,As a local one of my favorite affordable places to eat with just two or even more people. Good friendly service and clean.
15330,The river is indeed savage!! Trail is jice along and around the river. You can feel the permafrost there during summers when water oozes out of the ground when you press your foot hard on the ground.
15331,The bathroom was dirty. The bed was hard. We had to ask the front desk for an alarm clock! No fridge.
15332,Food
15333,Awesome as always. Hot Philly with mushrooms
15334,"Disregard the exterior appearance.  The food is really good.
Service is excellent."
15335,I always make a stop at Fast Eddy's when driving through.
15336,"SKIP THE DEALER, MIDAS, MEINEKE, AND COME HERE! THE MOST HONEST AUTO REPAIR SHOP. I took my car to the dealer, mechanics inspected my car, and I was quoted to replace my brakes for over 1k, extra services needed because my car was ""unsafe"" to drive, and it totaled to almost a $2k quote. I called in FATS to get a quote for brakes and rotors serviced and their prices were much less compared to midas, meineke, and all other auto shops who could've serviced me same day. I had to wait 3 days to take in my car to F.A.T.S. because they were very busy those days. WORTH THE WAIT. I went early in the morning and got my vehicle inspected immediately and taken in for service. They walked me to the car and showed me exactly what was wrong before working on it. It turned out to be worn bearings and alignment service needed, my brakes still had 70% usage left and rotors were good. It cost a little over $300, but they did a great job and saved me alot of money from being cheated by the authorized dealer and other corporate shops who wanted to charge me $1100-2000+. This local shop is professional, honest, and probably the best price in town. Great customer service. I will take my car here every time and recommend everyone to come here, you will save $$$$$."
15337,So glad it's open late with SD concerns taken seriously!
15338,Decent
15339,was nice
15340,"Monday is cook your own steak night, everyone was quite friendly"
15341,Food wasn't very good.
15342,Beautiful
15343,So busy and super long lines
15344,Great food
15345,Thanks again for your service
15346,Great sushi at this establishment. Always fresh and flavorful.. good service to boot! Give them a try!
15347,The best
15348,"If you're building a small or massive project then you'll find all the materials at SBS.  There are two locations in Anchorage; this location doesn't have the vinyl siding, so you'll need to visit the other location at 7828 Lake Otis Pkwy.  This location is open on Sundays, unlike the other location.  Plenty of parking at this location!  Sadly this location has really tall stairs and the ramp is narrow, steep, and far away from the main entrance.  If your legs are sore from a workout; if you suffer from a physical issue that requires handrails; or if you're in a wheelchair then you'll want to use the entrance near Tudor Road and not the main entrance.

SBS is owned by Builders FirstSource out of Dallas, Texas.  Builders FirstSource is a publicly traded company NASDAQ: BLDR.

15349,Top magic store in Anchorage. I would say the most competitive store in the state for all games. Staff is well-informed.
15350,"Not as helpful and knowledgeable as hoped, but still good."
15351,Hard to want to stay there. Old furnishings and building. May be what you want if low cost is the priority.
15352,Best Indian food in Anchorage!
15353,Great help! Thanks Sam
15354,Holiday is where it's at for all your gas convenience needs and also the car wash obviously.  In this neck of the woods having a car washes important and it's convenient and next to my home and I liked it and it always leaves my car very very clean versus others leave streaks and marks everywhere and I got to run it through twice when I come here it's only one time thanks again Holiday!
15355,Really tasty sushi get the spider or pantera roll both delicious
15356,Awesome experience! First time customer and very satisfied. My normal barber couldn't get me in for an appointment so these guys fit me into their schedule. Very professional cut. Looks like this place is my new Barber shop from now on.
15357,"Portions are huge, and the food is good."
15358,Love it
15359,Location right off Muldoon in an excellent area. Inside is cozy and clean. Has a nice bar area. Food is great! Overall a great place for families.
15360,"I had a leaking windshield seal, they explained the problem and my options, and then offered to replace the windshield right then as i waited for a good price. They had the glass on hand and it was very quick and professional."
15361,"always polite, helping a busy mom out. my order has never been wrong!"
15362,"If you want pretty good pizza, and don't mind being treated like you are a major inconvenience, you'll like Guidos.  We've been going to Guidos for years.   The salad bar is always fresh and clean. I love the huge Greek salad and our favorite pizza is the Greek Style Combo.  I would give them an excellent rating except the service is, more often than not, downright rude.  The last time I called for delivery, (a Friday at 5:15) I was told it would take an hour (not unreasonable.)  After 1.5 hours I called to ask if the pizza was on the way and the guy hung up on me.  After 2.5 hours I was dialing the phone to tell them to forget it when the delivery driver arrived.  The driver was extremely friendly and apologized for being so late.  When I looked at the receipt I noticed they had charged me twice.  When I called about the double charge, the guy who answered the phone listened and said, ""ok, we'll fix it"" and hung up.  So, they have pretty good pizza and most of the time we visit service is so-so to just rude.  We know that going in.  When we really care about good service with great pizza, we go to Mooses Tooth and wait for a table.  When we don't want to wait we go to Guidos."
15363,Great coffee and super cozy environment
15364,Fun
15365,Amazing
15366,"Food is delicious! Highly recommend! We had the scallops pasta, the chicken fried chicken pasta and the rice bowl with salmon."
15367,Great selection and good staff
15368,I love Thai food and they serve great food in Fairbanks
15369,Best real authentic Mexican food
15370,It's a mall
15371,I'm here almost every Wednesday love it.
15372,I enjoy eating out at this place. Its always hot and always tastes great. Usually faster service inside due to ppl just not eating inside. (Maybe its the eating chicken in public that stops ppl lol)
15373,This is the best Subway restaurant in Anchorage! The Staff here are awesome!
15374,"The seafood chimichanga was waaay better than the chicken chimichanga I was served by mistake.
If you get something that you didn't order, do you send it back or just go with the flow?
The chicken chimichanga was absolutely packed with chicken. Kinda bland chicken for that matter. I confirmed with the sweeter than flan waitress that my perception wasn't imagined, and she brought it back to the kitchen. So glad I didn't go with the flow. That happens sometimes when you're wrapped up in conversation with your dinner partner.
The seafood chimichanga was an entirely different level!
So delicious, I could not stop eating.  No leftovers for me.
So much flavor!"
15375,Decent hotel
15376,"Several visits throughout this summer. Really appreciate the customer service, professionalism and fair pricing. Great crew."
15377,Interesting place!
15378,Great Pool and fun and chill divey vibe!
15379,Best sushi in Anchorage! Sit at the bar and Isaac will treat you like family.
15380,"Wonderful hike.  Really sad to see how far back the glacier has been receding. If you take the upper trail lots of bears, be sure to bring mace"
15381,Staff didnt know where things were.
15382,Too expensive per hour
15383,A gem of a place if you like to knit or have a sewing project. So many choices.
15384,"Great food, great staff and a clean establishment. Will definatly continue coming here in the future"
15385,Favorite store
15386,Really enjoyed this walking tour.  Lots of history.
15387,Least favorite pizza in town but they sell by the slice
15388,Have literally everything you need. Lots of sale items too.
15389,"Cabela's is amazing, what more needs to be said?"
15390,Yum yum yum
15391,Fast and excellent customer service!
15392,"Love this place, great food and beautiful brown ladies of the north and the hardworking men in the back. Quick quality service and never disappointed here!"
15393,Ew knocking on the door at 11am is not ok. Evelynn is super rude.
15394,Friendly and quick
15395,Worst Fred Meyer in the state of Alaska.
15396,Great place for drinks n dinner
15397,My absolute favorite Palmer restaurant. I love their burgers and adore their pie. Can't want to come back!
15398,I dont drink. Dont know why i was here
15399,Amazing fun and great staff
15400,Good store. I get lost and have home improvement goals. Like they're clearance and they're employees are kind
15401,"The pork loin sandwich were two pork loins served on a brioche bun with pickles,  tomato and lettuce.  Very filling with two sides."

15407,Absolutely gorgeous!
15408,Great
15409,I have AAA since 1996 and this is the second time I have had a negative experience - they could not provide me a tow truck to pick up my motorcycle that had broken down on the New Seward Hwy in Alaska on 7-30-18 - at 7:30 pm... their customer service department said they did not have any tow trucks available in my area to come pick me/my motorcycle up - they left me stranded;  how can it be that there are more than 15 towing companies in my area and they can't find one???  Thankfully I had a friend with a truck and trailer that finally came to get me off of the highway.  Terrible service!
15410,"Overpriced and under-stocked. There seems to be an ordering issue within management because the shelves are often bare. Extra stock is stored in the isles which makes it impossible to get around. The pharmacy staff is rude. The floral staff is never at their post. Check out is slow and the sale items are NEVER calculated correctly. Staff often talks about their personal lives while working, making for an uncomfortable check out. Please attempt some level of professionalism."
15411,Great place for froyo and good selection.
15412,"Decent enough food.  The PX only has a small offering of food, this is one of my favorite places.  I did get some guff from the guy working the register because I brought in Burger King for my boys (All from AAFES...)  None the less, one of my frequent stops at the PX."
15413,"Great place, Great food, pleasant atmosphere.
Kinda like Cheers, everybody knows your name"
15414,The food is good for the price. Try the fried rice for sure.
15415,Great merchandise for great prices.
15416,Great food & drink!
15417,Love this place
15418,"This is a fun place to stop on your travels in the Palmer/Anchorage area. My husband and I came upon this reindeer farm by accident and decided to stop and check it out.  It is a short tour, but long enough to stretch your legs.  I would highly recommend for young children."
15419,"What a jewel.  This is the best keept secret in Anchorage, AK!  Loved it, especially the cheese. Will go back in a minute."
15420,"Beer was okay, our waiter sucked. Not all our food came out. I spoke to the manager and all he said was sorry even when I asked him how he was going to fix this issue."
15421,I prefer the university location.
15422,"Nice hotel. Close to an antique store that sells a lot of L. Ron Hubbard's fiction works, which is unnerving. (L. Ron Hubbard is the founder of the Church of Scientology.)"
15423,Surprisingly good for a buffet. There's some dishes there I wouldn't have expected that aren't made for White Americans.
15424,Nicely done again
15425,Kelsey's family!
15426,Lovely place. Very welcoming ‚ô° Excellent staff‚òÜ I won't go anywhere else.
15427,Much better than the last visit. Fast service and amazing food! The waiter knew his beers and was very good at helping make a selection.
15428,Love coming here for cheap treats and toys for my furry baby's

15430,Quick stop.
15431,"Best fuel prices, especially on Fridays! They have fast food available and excellent prices on gift options. Friendly staff!"
15432,"Better than Village Inn, if that means anything."
15433,Don't have everything but close.
15434,beautiful
15435,Great place to stop for a burger and beer.
15436,It's McDonald's. What do you expect?ü§ó
15437,"Huge selection, amazing tea, and a great place to stop in a get a quick refreshment"
15438,The meat lovers omelet had more potatoes than meat.  The Denver omelet had raw vegetables.  There wasn't enough silverware on the table and the avacado omelet had old tasting avacados on it.  It was cold in the eating area and the waitress spilled hot chocolate on one of us.
15439,"Ghetto, rude, incompetent staff that disappears for 30+ minutes at a time. Rooms aren't clean, bad crowd."
15440,"Love Carl‚Äôs JR! If you go to this location order through the drive through, don‚Äôt go inside. Inside smells of sewage and is extremely unappetizing."
15441,Local pub and eatery. Good bar food and great views of the harbor.
15442,"Delicious, unique, Alaskan"
15443,A great place to eat and reasonable.
15444,"Fast, friendly service and good food"
15445,"Individual running the drive-thru was less than professional, along with the less than cheerful demeanor he also forgot part of our causing us to have to drive back."
15446,Good rolls
15447,"The delivery driver pulled into the driveway, called me, when I walked to get the pizza, he set a 6 pack of Mountain Dew next to the pizzas and when he handed me the pizzas, he grabbed the six pack and said: ""Oh, this is mine."", and got into his vehicle. What a piece of garbage."
15448,Loved this place!
15449,Service is ok.
15450,Great customer service and a huge selection of merchandise.  Did you know your coupons never expire and you can redeem multiple coupons at once.
15451,"This place is great! They have a large selection. Super friendly cashiers. My only suggestion is for them to do something to identify their staff (name tag, apron, polo) not behind the register. It can take awhile to find help."
15452,Great service and great food
15453,Order and paid using the app and when I got there was told that the payment didn't go through. So I had to pay again.

15481,"I knew the Turtle Club had to be good as there was a long line outside of the door. Once we got seated, the service was excellent, and our server was attentive. I  had the prime rib this place is known for. An end cut, well done (Almost enough for the rare loving  Purists to crucify me). It was exactly what I wanted. The toughest thing after dinner was picking a dessert. I highly recommend this place. You won't be dissatisfied."
15482,"Great food, freindly staff, and reasonably priced."

15496,"Love üíò this place
Very knowledgeable staff."
15497,Best Burgers
15498,Fast food price to quality of tase ratio is better than any other Major Fast Food chain that I know of in town! Sure their are cheaper places to eat but it probably doesn't taste as well. I love itüçîüçü
15499,Otay
15500,"We visited this coffee shop around breakfast, and though the food options were limited, the veggie burritos we got were very good and so were the muffins and the frittata.
The coffee was pretty nice as well, and we particularly liked the decor. It seemed like it wouldn't be out of place as a Brooklyn coffee shop"
15501,"Lifelong gymrat thats me this is thebonly real gym in town open to all.
Even after all the remods and facelifts still has same feel.
Even when lot is full still plenty of room to workout, shower and swim.
Onlyn detractor is price and location."

15507,Superior customer service! Thanks bra specialists!
15508,"The new post people, neither rain, snow or any horrid conditions that would stop most businesses in their tracks from delivering will stop a Domino's delivery person, the mail people of food. The food is what it is, do not expect grade A 5 star resturant tier food lets keep it real, but they come in clutch when it's late and you're to lazy to cook and need something to stuff your face in stat."

15517,This place has great food...  Great place to brings your kids and eat.  It has a nice down home feel and I love the decor!!  I think this place is a great choice for a quite breakfast with the family.

15519,To expensive for a par movie theater
15520,My granddaughters enjoyed their pizza on this heatwave we are having.
15521,"Service was great, and the prices were very fair by Alaska standards.
Sandwich was great, the side was as well.
I only regret I didn't make it for the sourdough pancakes, which are pretty hard to find, but I'll definitely be visiting on my way back North to catch breakfast.
And I'll be grabbing another sandwich to go, for the long drive."
15522,Awesome chowder and cornbread
15523,"Clean, friendly, good breakfast."

15531,They work hard to give you the best deal
15532,"When Arctic Fox became True Blue Too I was devastated. But I gave True Blue Too a try and I have had nothing but wonderful experiences there. They are fast, friendly and very accommodating. I am really glad there is still a coffee shop in that spot. It truly is the perfect location. Keep up the good work, ladies!"
15533,Beautiful
15534,"Love this place, anything and everything you need."
15535,They don't carry 1/2 the parts you need and the times they do have it you will probably find out it's the wrong one wen you get home to put it on ...
15536,I went inside to place my order. It was quick and I was out the door! It was Great!
15537,Love the food
15538,Cheap and grate service....1100...688...out

15540,Beautiful and family friendly.  One of my children's favorite places in town.  Up to date material and lots of activities for any age group

15546,French dip sandwich is great!
15547,"Pretty much always on point. Quality servings, friendly staff,and drive thru is easy to maneuver.  Only wish they would go back to offering lobby or even just curbside, I can't drive so I'm limited to when I have a guest over with a car..."

15552,Always the best.
15553,"We come here semi-regularly and are pleased to have some good vegetarian food available, especially for delivery! The staff behind the counter are ALWAYS very kind and accommodating.

They just started Door Dash as well! We placed an order and one of the items was not listed as they do in the restaurant. The manager understood, addressed the issue, and was very kind, polite through it all! It made us glad to be customers here, and shows how confident Spice It Up is with their product."
15554,Amazing food and service! Great people!

15572,Amazing food and service. Great prices too.
15573,Has an ominous feeling about it
15574,"Channa Masala is the best, but anything on their menu is authentic and delicious."
15575,Fast cheap and good food
15576,Yum.coffee
15577,"I dont know about their services, but they keep flip flopping on their quote. Talking to the guy felt like interviewing a presidential  democratic candidate. Make a decision."
15578,Nice to have groceries and other merchants available to us here.
15579,Good food and lots of it.
15580,"Five stars for the food.  Comfort food.  Yummy sandwiches.  Homemade soup, which you can sample before you buy. Excellent cinnamon rolls.  Lukewarm friendly staff.  Nice endpoint for the drive down Turnagain Arm looking for Belugas & Dall sheep.  They have indoor seating & picnic tables outside where you can see the mountains & their beautiful flower baskets."
15581,Been a few months since I had been here last and I am happy to report they are just as good as ever.
15582,Nice place. Accommodating. Reasonable
15583,Staff is always friendly and helpful. The rooms are not the most modern but it adds character and comfort to the rooms in a great location in Anchorage.
15584,Such a great place to shop
15585,"I ordered online and waited two hours for delivery. Checked online and they added an hour to the order, so 3 hours waiting. Fine, Friday is a busy day, so I called to (very politely) check the status of my order and Carlos hung up on me. Last time they forgot the sauces I paid extra for. Try dominos or GAPCO if you‚Äôd like to receive your entire order in a reasonable amount of time."
15586,"Haru Sushi is the best Sushi on the Planet. Wonderful service, super friendly staff and The fellows at The Sushi Bar are simply The Best! ‚ò∫"
15587,The only nasty thing here is the parking during the winter
15588,"Love the place pizza always hot and delicious, and the Beer."
15589,It's part of ak
15590,"Awesome service, friendly efficient staff."
15591,Great service knowledgeable . But very pricey
15592,"Ok, needs to be cleaned better!
Just went into the store today n they don't have the right signs in place n not very clean. I only go here when I really have to. Price signs not where they should be in some area's."
15593,Went to the Dowling store to look at hydraulic jacks. They have quite a selection but not the type I am looking for. Amazon only offered one offshoot brand I have never heard of. Napa is still a good choice for your needs. Good luck.
15594,"I always order the French dip. Most of the things in the menu are pricey. But if you go, try the French dip. They are famous for it."
15595,Great food
15596,Great dealership with great service
15597,"What a great place on earth. The resort is situated in such a remote setting and over the years has integrated sustainable eco living with techno modern life.

They always have an interesting crew of workers there and always friendly! The food and drinks in the restaurant and bar are so good too - everything fresh and with a nice pour.

Make sure you check out the aurorium there which is for watching the aurora borealis."
15598,Some of the best customer service I've ever experienced... You leave feeling good about your purchase and better as a person!!
15599,Helped  me  knew  what he was  talking about
15600,Too much to choose from
15601,"This is the place to go when looking for furniture in Fairbanks. I stopped here after going to the big furniture giants in town, after having a horrible experience at both. This place has the best prices by far and American made furniture. Dont judge a book by its cover! The owner was fast to help me find the perfect rocker recliner and has many different colors IN STOCK! They have earned my business. Excellent experience all around."
15602,Hair in our food... Gross. Menu is dwindling. Cashier isnt a people person. Lame. Used to eat here all the time.
15603,Food Order didn't come out right. For how long of the wait you wouldn't be an issue. Customer service was good. Very polite.
15604,Horrible service
15605,Amazing burgers
15606,"Can't help but feel cheated when I go here. Their prices are often same or higher than Kaladi, Steamdot, or other local roasters, but Starbucks is thousands of times larger than them. They should be less expensive and less stingy with the espresso shots.

They got an extra star for their variety of hot sandwiches. This is one area where they actually beat a lot of places."
15607,Helpfull and kind folks.  Have anything crafy you need
15608,Amazing food. Amazing service staff.
15609,"If you love books, this is the place to go in Juneau!!!"
15610,Friday is Steak Night-$17.00
15611,They have fresh water and $5 RV dumping available.
15612,Great unique pizza
15613,"Extremely long wait just to speak to a teller, or deposit a check."
15614,Always good service and awesome food! The portions and presentation of their delicious food is second to none!
15615,"Good service. And they often have what I am trying to find, but the prices are just terrible. In almost every case I would rather wait a couple days to get it from NewEgg. I understand we live in Alaska and that it costs money to ship here, but give me a break."
15616,"These characters always have so much business, maybe because they are good?  One really nice thing, they took the time to IM my 2-barrel carb. vehicle - which the previous owner had let the IM lapse and just got seasonal tags for.  Well, I had repaired the problems but the oil-changer national chainstore, which starts with a J and ends with a -ube, turned me away at first glance, without even looking at the registration or the new muffler or the new 02 sensor or even popping the hood... Gabe's took the vehicle, brought out a longer, more complicated form and machine, and tested it.  It ended up passing with better numbers than my modern truck with EFI.  The other guys didn't even give 'er a chance, but Gabe's did."
15617,Great professional dental service. The dentist noticed  & fixed several mistakes done by other dentists.
15618,Great views friendly staff. Diverse menu with something for everyone. Large selection of beers and wines.
15619,Delicious pizza! They have pool and darts. We've never had to wait for a table or too long for our food.
15620,Good food but service could've been faster
15621,"The location is easy to find. The layout is nice with the exception of the ""reception area"" being small. The ladies that have done my mani's and pedi's are nice, but the end product quality is ok. With the lady several visits I have noticed that within a week the polish from the pedi starts to come off and the gel starts to peal/ seperate from the mani. I'm not doing anything different with my daily life and due to a busy schedule I don't always have time to go back and have them fix the gel."
15622,Fast service and yummy food
15623,Took my truck there to have it winterized. Not only did they break two of the brackets holding on my moose guard but they lost on of the bolts as well. If they are so careless just to put a winterization kit on a car I have no idea how they have such a high rating. I would NEVER Recommend them and they will never get any of our business again.
15624,Feels and tastes just like you're at cold stone
15625,Clean and we'll lit place
15626,"Folks are awesome, food superior, great community servants with their ongoing custom soup donations to Bean's Cafe."
15627,Best Mexican food in Anchorage.
15628,"Can't say enough good about this place! Awesome food, very authentic,  good service, lovely atmosphere"
15629,The girl who made our ice cream was so friendly and the ice cream was yummy!
15630,Favorite store!
15631,Nice staff
15632,nice laptops that you can use
15633,Knit glacier was amazing. Beautiful trail ride. Pretty surreal. Saw a pack of daul sheep up close too. Saw moose and lots of tracks
15634,Awesome food.
15635,"Clean, well organized, nice staff."
15636,"Slow service,"
15637,"Very good information available at the center, actual park rangers to guide and hike with you and the animal info is good to read up on before you take the tour and see them."
15638,Good friendly service
15639,Great beers
15640,Helpful staff large selection fun atmosphere
15641,Burgers just melt in your mouth.  A bit pricey but worth it.
15642,Mini Chimi..       ....nuff said
15643,Hands down best nachos in town! I‚Äôve never had a bad experience here.
15644,Very dissappointed. Went there for lunch. Menu sounded good but sandwich had one thing slice of meet and cheese. Mostly tasted just the bread. Not worth the money.
15645,"We had quick lunch, driveway. It was my very first time and believe very last time as well.. Well then I had stomach issues, terribly bad. It is junk food, and it is just junk like McDonald's sadly. Shame, that has no quality."
15646,Just getting gas
15647,"Liked that all the animals are native to the environment and many were rescued. However, many enclosures were difficult to see animals in. The map was confusing as were the signs along the path. Seemed to need some updating."
15648,Awesome hike
15649,Nice atmosphere
15650,"Perfect spot for birthdays, kid friendly. Bar and pizza from across the street is available."
15651,Good people
15652,"Can be very busy and service can be iffy, but the food and beer are always great."
15653,Unless you see a plain movie (not 3D or imax or rpx) you will pay no less than $15 a ticket. That's just too much to see most movies.
15654,Just like all the rest. Same Chinese junk.
15655,"So much fun! Loved Paige and her owner, the place, everything about it! Will definitely do this again!"
15656,Very professional
15657,All about salmon. Learn about fish ladders. Everything about salmon birth to salmon spawnING. Great info.
15658,Such a value
15659,Great little hole in the wall that serves fresh beef burgers and some ahhhhhmazing fries! 100x better than the ANC BJ!
15660,Love their BBQ chicken wrap! Always have good service. Happy customer üëçüèª
15661,"Great food,  quiet atmosphere. Love their beef stew."
15662,There are so many options to explore and tasty! Beer is awesome. This reindeer pizza was my favorite! Also nachos are delicious. Although there is always a waiting time it is worth it and customer service is great!
15663,"Crepes are tasty, but you have to wait a while after ordering, and paying while they cook up your order, queuing up behind others ahead of you through their service window."
15664,Cafe is on point!
15665,Knowledgeable and helpful employees.   Good computer repair and service.
15666,"The Hampton Inn in Fairbanks television was not working and after reporting this was told that it was a provider issue and would be fixed overnight. It was not and when we called the front desk, did not get the impression anything would be fixed unless a technician was called in and that the clerk was not even aware of the building wide issue. This is not a major impact since we were there for other venues but needs to be noted. Anything else was perfect and we would absolutely stay there again. The Hampton Inn in Anchorage had so issues. Both places would be a favorable destination place if in the area again."
15667,Their inventory could use some help in areas.
15668,Dirty. Hard to access partly due to bad wifi and internet connections.
15669,very nice and clean campground
15670,Quick fast and easy take out or delivery
15671,Overpriced and old lady inside was rude.
15672,Got me in and out quick. Side view mirrors are a go.
15673,Great food
15674,"My son, a verified rock mogul from birth (he's now 8), begged me to stop in here so he could check out their collection of rocks and gems. I have to say, the owner was very special. Where anyone else might pass him off as a joke she spent time helping him select his gems and taught him how to choose the best ones. She has everything from necklaces, bracelets, and a large assortment of gems to spiritual statuettes and incense. According to the locals, its the best place to find citrine in the fall when the darkness comes (known for its bright sunshine energy)."
15675,"Maybe not the best haircut, but the prices and convenience is worth the unevenly trimmed bangs in my opinion."
15676,It's on a lake...that's cool.
15677,Excellent
15678,"Man, the pizza here was great. We were visiting from GA and decided to grab something quick to eat. The food was great and the beer was better. Yes, you lose some of that Alaska feel by visiting a commercial  place, but the food, drinks, and people were awesome."
15679,"Good food, good atmosphere and clean bathrooms"
15680,From gun shows to ice hockey! This is a cool place!
15681,"The ice cream was really good. But the workers made me feel really uncomfortable. I walked in as all the employees were chatting and instead of dispersing and at least pretending to look busy, they just straight up stared us down. They almost seemed offended we interrupted their convo.  As soon as I walked in I wanted to get out, but was too determined to get icecream."
15682,The five stars says it all
15683,"Great place to see salmon swimming upstream, and there are even designated fishing areas downstream. If you're visiting Anchorage near the end of summer, check this place out!"
15684,Not that good of food
15685,"Really good food, fast and nice service, and clean! We will definitely be back :)"
15686,Good food
15687,Went to the pharmacy in Carr's.
15688,Love this car wash!
15689,Great Grande's!
15690,Amazing place!
15691,I like it.  They also have a buffet for 14.99. Real Mexican food.  Great customer service.
15692,Slow service
15693,Helpful staff
15694,Best place to go for these two items we keep going back for chicken fried rice and won ton soup it's the best. All the food is great and sensibly priced. Staff are very nice good customer service.
15695,I don't think we ever saw anything ugly
15696,"Steak was above average vegetables undercooked.

Typical of this company hurry up and give us your money for lackluster effort"
15697,Good food. A little on th err salty side tho
15698,Great counter help awesome staff
15699,Ok
15700,"Open all week, easy to make an appointment and all the lady's do a great job of styling your hair. Never had a bad experience here, or at the school in midtown."
15701,Best fast food hamburger. I like their baked potato instead of all the other places' nasty fries.
15702,Wow ate lunch there.    Great food fair price.   Cheaper than fast food and much better
15703,"Prompt service. Clean and well kept, even the mens room. Food is what you'd expect from Arbys. I'd give it a 5 if only I could get an ArbyQ."
15704,Necessary evil
15705,"Great food, friendly staff"
15706,Customer service is horrible
15707,"Ronnie 2 was a great place to eat! The decor was inviting and nostalgic,  the food was absolutely delicious, and the portions were huge!
Definately will dine there again!"
15708,Nice location with great views.
15709,Really fun easy hike. I would definitely recommend this hike to any and everyone
15710,Love this spot
15711,One place for everything.
15712,They do good work.
15713,"Had some great lunch here , food was awesome , service was quick and friendly and the environment was pretty chill üòéüëçüèΩ"
15714,Great movie selection.
15715,just lovin' it here
15716,"Java Flats is an amazing place to go have a wonderful breakfast sandwich or burrito. They have the freshest salads that can feed 2 people and the soup is delicious! Customer service is hands down the best, even on the busy days! My favorite part about Java Flats is the fresh baked cookies! They have a wonderful variety to choose from and offer gluten free as well. A must try when you visit the Emerald Island!"
15717,To many people!
15718,This place looks brand new after a recent renovation. The service is a little slow for a fast food place. Actually while I'm writing this review I'm realizing that I've had enough time to stand here and write this before gettingy food. I can't resist stopping though because there isn't one in Homer. You just have to get a spicy chicken sandwich!!!!
15719,Quesadillas are my fav here!
15720,Best sandwiches in town!!
15721,North Pole nice!
15722,Constant road noise and early morning train whistle. Bring ear plugs. No one else at the campground. Didn't use vaulted toilets because no need.
15723,Nice
15724,"Lets start with the positive. The staff were friendly, understanding,  and the service was quick (too quick). Atmosphere is definitely clean and has that hipster vibe (doesnt fancy my boat, but its better than standing up and eating on the go). Now the negative. Looks like theres a lot of people who can agree. The ""Chicken Shack"" Chicken is very bland. The batter is soft, greasey, and the chicken is ""slimey"". Burger is bland as well. Never had to add salt onto a pricey burger before, but yea, it needed it (still couldnt finish it. I dont like wasting food, but my family and I could not even get the initial start going). Back to the chicken.... there was an error on our order, but it was quickly rectified (too quick). Appears we got some ""15 min under the heat lamp"" chicken. McDonalds doesnt even keep their food under the lamp that long. Not a 1 star because once again the staff/service is strong. Definitely not 3 or more stars, food needs work."
15725,Fix your drive through. I shouldn't need a 4x4 to get some chicken tenders. FFS.
15726,Very small. Will have to go back and check out other options.
15727,The service is always great
15728,Awesome on black friday
15729,"Came to the drive- thru at your Eagle River location. Kristine who works the drive thru was the rudest person I have come across! She didn't speak and gave me the meanest look. Those daggers were outrageous and I don't know if it was because I asked her to give me a moment to look over the menu before I ordered. But, her demeanor was for a very unprofessional person."
15730,"Very pretty and much of it untouched but, if you can‚Äôt access a majority of it besides on foot it it all might just as well be a void.  The drive into the middle of it to the copper mining area is the best part of it for a normal visitor, on a road.   Drive in and bring your spare tires!"
15731,Its good
15732,Good food
15733,Great longtime anchorage establishment...good portions...and fair prices
15734,"friendly staff, great swimming lessons."
15735,Love this place. Eat here all the time. Great food great prices great staff
15736,Amazing
15737,Super friendly staff. Neat and organized store
15738,Pizza was made perfect & was made quickly too
15739,Ok
15740,"Good food  ,great service"
15741,Pricy. Messy theater. Once again some inconsiderate ass kicking the back of my seat during the movie. Why does this always hapen to me here.
15742,"After reading the reviews we almost didn't go to the Hot Springs, but I'm glad we did. The facility is dated, but the changing rooms and showers were clean when we visited. Yes, there is algae on the rocks in the outdoor pool, but the water is clear and for heavens sake, it's an outdoor hot springs! If you don't  want to experience nature, go to a heavily chlorinated indoor pool at a Ritz Carlton."
15743,It was okay
15744,Amazing surplus deals
15745,Have what you need
15746,"The whole meal was a disaster,  my salad had hair in the bottom of the plate the food was cold. The manager took off the salad and food to cold to melt butter literally. The bill still came to 38.00+ tip. Never again!!!!"
15747,Nice and quite
15748,Not clean not attentive and not fresh. The bread I got was very dry and tasteless the meat was slightly discolored and the servers were slow and I had to repeat the two things I wanted on my sandwich like three times.
15749,"They charge fees on everything, change plans and force you to purchase new plans. New owners are going to charge you to recoup their purchase. Just do a search on how many people dislike this place. They're here for money only"
15750,"Fast, friendly staff, food orders are always correct."
15751,"I am very disappointed at this hotel. The heating was not working properly the two night stayed there in March. My lotion bag went missing after I used it in the morning. Called and asked the front desk; she said I will check on it and call me back which never did. I called again few hours later, another receptionist said he will look into it and called me back in 3 minutes stating that he didn't find it. Talked to the manager in the next morning,  the manager and two housekeepers said they checked the trash and didn't find anything. The manager kept asking me if I left it somewhere else and she said she believed in her housekeepers; sounded like I made up the whole story.(which I did not make it up!) She said I am sorry but didn't seems sincerely. Also one of the housekeepers left a comment stating that's crazy.
My friend and I did not ask for any compensation. We just wanted to get the problem fixed or get my lotion bag with all the items in it; however, we did not appreciate their attitude towards this situation.
I would not recommend to stay at this hotel."
15752,"I love the worship service, every week has different groups with an amazing team and music, please keep up the good music in the church."
15753,The best coffee stand in town!
15754,Hot and spicy
15755,Awesome
15756,Good food

15762,"Good place, nice variation of options."
15763,"Great customer service and a decent variety of in and out items.

Fresh coffee, espresso and ice cream as well.

Prices are reasonable."
15764,Ok
15765,"May God always bless this business and owners. Call and explain what your car needs are and make an appt. Yes, none of that first come first served and ur car sits for two days. All car places should operate on appts. They will call you if there is a problem. I have used them about two years, no complaints."
15766,Great food.
15767,Lots of local artifacts from 1964 quake.  Diorama of town prior to quake was neat.
15768,Best chicken fried steak
15769,"How lucky are we that we live in one of the least populous states in the US and have one of the world's best brewer's! ABC has great service and top notch beers. It is not for everyone as many of the beers are high octane, use brettanomyces, and are packet with flavors. However, if you like barleywines, stouts, or IPAs this is the place for you. They certainly produce other types of great beer, but this, to me, is where they really shine. The establishment is comfy despite a strong industrial vibe. They started serving a very limited menu in a wood fire stove. My last visit I had braised beef nachos and they were excellent. I had their Deal with the Devil Barleywine as they were hand pouring limited edition. Otherwise, I would have gone for their double IPA or their stout (aka The Darkest Hour)."
15770,Not 24/7
15771,Open for breakfast 24 hours. Good food and great service!
15772,It has good dog food
15773,Very nice and clean facility.

15775,Great bowls üëçüòé
15776,"Great selection, deals on liquor."
15777,"It was busy and I kinda rush thru to get out , to close for comfort for me !"
15778,Best authentic Mexican I've had in Anchorage!
15779,Fantastic customer service when I stopped in and decided to buy my Wife a Bible ! Luckily the friendly staff person showed me that there are very beautiful Bibles made specially for women ! My Wife has been enjoying her new Bible !
15780,Almost everything need my favorite restaurant and an indoor go kart track! That's 5 stars.
15781,Sales associate who approached me became rude and dismissive of questions after I said that I wouldn't be buying a vehicle for about another year. Not planning to go there in the future for a car. I would rather drive to Wasilla's Kendall Ford.
15782,Great local place with wonderful service and top quality food
15783,Great selection for our little alaska town!
15784,Honest people
15785,Wonderful service and food. Their Seafood noodle soup is the best!
15786,They were very Curtis and concerns about me and my teeth. First time I wasn't scared to go to the dentist. Thank You guys
15787,Outstanding sales!
15788,"Really friendly and make you feel like you've been going to them for years from the first-day, my kids really like going to them must say something"
15789,"DO NOT ORDER ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!! Second time happened that after ordering pizza online through their site, a few days later someone from ALBANIA tried to run our card (to buy something from Globe.com.al Albanian site) first for $1000, and second time for $200!!! Good thing our bank blocked these charges!!! Its a total scam and they save card numbers and run them later! If you want their pizza, order over the phone and ask for the %20 online discount, but dont trust their site!!"
15790,Love to bring grandkids
15791,Good food.  Good friendly service.  Good prices.
15792,"An hour‚Äôs drive from Fairbanks, Chena Hot Springs Resort is known for its natural hot-springs lake, year-round ice museum, and Northern Lights viewing opportunities. Found over a hundred years ago by gold miners who saw steam rising from the Chena River Valley, the curative waters have been soothing people ever since. I went at night and it was pretty busy."
15793,I really enjoyed the choices available here.  I could spend hours exploring.
15794,All you can eat sushi is a deal
15795,Ok zoo nice lay out
15796,Beautiful
15797,Great food great service love it here
15798,Just there to pick up live stalk they gotta do a better job to Manny expired producks such a loss
15799,Better to go in the evening after five. Faster checkout.
15800,It's just a gas station
15801,Went in for alignment. They explained everything in terms that I could understand. Reasonable priced as well. Thank you guys!!!!
15802,"Stayed here several time. The owners are friendly, campground is very well kept and clean, and the shop is full of unique gifts/items. Highly recommend it!!"
15803,"my pad thai
the chicken in the pad thai tasted like shrimp."
15804,"Great addition to Fairbanks. Always friendly. Food is fast. Chicken curry rice is fantastic, and so are the lamb gyros. I've never liked lamb, sheep, or goat products due to the strong flavor. Whatever Tariq does to the lamb is great. I've probably eaten more lamb from Spice It Up than I have through the rest of my life combined. Try it."
15805,"Busy,great selection"
15806,Cleanest I've seen it. I think the state and the 4 wheeling community has been doing a great job at keeping this place up
15807,Love this place. It's like going to an adult Toys-R-Us.
15808,"Somethings where on sale and affordable, and didn't know who was staff or who was customers"
15809,Cozy. Good food. Great service!
15810,Service is great
15811,"Looked everywhere, no walls for sale."
15812,"I gotta say this is a amazing restaurant that I have been to time and time again since they opened. Clean, fast, accurate and delicious are just a few ways to explain this place, as if they needed another reason for praise they even donate to the local fire department."
15813,"This is our favorite restaurant in Fairbanks! The sushi is great and reasonably priced for sushi. We enjoy the combos that include a sushi roll, a hot meat, a salad and a few sashimi. We have also gotten the boxes. They are well priced for a good amount of food."
15814,They have amazing service and are willing to help you find the right fit for your family
15815,Great place to bring the kids. Morning service is on top of it. Quality is what you would expect of the franchise.
15816,"The fish & chips were outstanding! Waitstaff was so accommodating, moving us closer to the fireplace since it was a cold and rainy day! Thanx, hope to see you again soon!"
15817,Great store friendly people nice variety a little spendy depending on tastes
15818,Has a decent selection of non-GMO foods.
15819,"Great food, awesome staff and delish food!"
15820,"Always excellent food of wide variety, good taps, and good service."

15823,Great coffee and great views
15824,Best Pho in Anchorage
15825,Good local store for outdoor needs. Very friendly and helpful staff. Lots of great items and good seasonal items. Great sales between summer and winter.
15826,"For kids, only. If you have children, they will love it."
15827,"Food was decent in taste and okay in quality. The real kicker is the price. Alaska is more expensive, that is true, but Buckets is extremely expensive to the point of insanity."
15828,Great place for a hike
15829,Great food! Low key place to grab a bite to eat. We ate there 2x in one day. ü§≠Desserts were delicious!
15830,Very humbling to visit this piece of history. My kids loved seeing the eagles.
15831,Cashiers are friendly and the prices fit my budget.
15832,Good food and friendly staff
15833,Delicious savory crepes and Serbian Irish coffee. Nice small restaurant
15834,Over priced selections of meals. I'd not recommend this place for anything.
15835,"What an awesome place with lots to do, see and experience.  The Ice Museum is awesome."
15836,Wonderful breakfast
15837,Ariel is so great. She's really sweet and down to earth. She's also a great tattooer and I am so happy to work on my sleeve with her
15838,"Nice staff, great prices and quick service."
15839,Peaceful place near river amazing view
15840,Yummy.
15841,Absolutely beautiful!
15842,Only store in town that didn't run out of my choice of beverage.
15843,Pretty good if you know what you want. Has materials and tools specifically suited for painting related stuff.
15844,"Excellent, Andy and Karen are top notch and so is the park.  They make you feel like family. Cannot wait to go back.  Thank you for a wonderful r."
15845,"Oh, I love this place!"
15846,"Awesome food, and beers on tap. Would recommend everyone check them out. Burgers, Cheese fries, salads are great."
15847,Great family friendly course
15848,The people there are very friendly and helpful. The lobby is very clean and welcoming. Their groomer Michael is awesome and loves each of his furry clients andis very upfront with what us best for your furry best friend.
15849,"Friendly ,food was yummy,slow service and they were confused"
15850,Great selection and friendly staff members.
15851,Awesome steaks
15852,Minimal shopping
15853,I have never seen it so empty! I still found a couple treasures.
15854,Very few recliners
15855,"Went on a weekday evening so it was pretty quiet and no lines or wait on any games which was a plus.  I've heard it can get pretty busy on the weekends and I can see why.  The place is  FUN! Especially the go cart racing.  That was  INTENSE and truthfully my absolute favorite activity without question.  They offer mini bowling, go cart racing, bumper cars and   rock climbing among other fun stuff for young and old alike.  There is a good selection of kiddie rides including games.  This is a fun place for the whole family and although it may be more spendy than some other types of family activities offered in the mat su Valley its definitely worth the extra money you will spend there.  It's been awhile since I've seen the entire family having a great time in the same place with no griping or complaints of boredom.
If you get a chance and want to spoil the kiddos some time I would highly suggest this place.  Must also add that the employee's are simply amazing and  really add so much to the fun, playful atmosphere of the Extreme  Fun Center."
15856,"Great views, great staff, good food."
15857,"Most of the things I got my new puppy i could have gotten it cheaper from Walmart. But there are a few pluses to going to petco such as knowledgeable staff who are more than willing to help you if you ask. The reason I  am not giving  more stares is because I was duped into spending more money because  they offer coupons for free  stuff and then they charged me for it anyway, as well as did not take the % off coupon. Basically I  paid full price for everything I got."
15858,"Cool little station, I like to stop here sometimes"
15859,"Friendly staff, clean establishment, prices seemed on par with other places in town, at least for pre-rolled."
15860,The regular coffee was hot and fresh.  The ginger bread was delicious.
15861,"I went to Goldstream for the first time in 2018 and got a pair of running shoes.  While I was there, I did the running test where they look at your stride and footfall to determine what kind of shoes are going to give you the best support. The staff was incredibly helpful was patient enought to answer the 67.93 trillion questions I had.  Since then, I've started training for the Equinox and Mrs. Stacy (Staci?) who works there has been a fountain of information and is super friendly.  All in all, cute little shop, easy to get to, the staff or friendly and know their craft and I one hundred percent recommend you check it out.  It's the embodiment of the Alaska spirit.  Additionally, they also have bikes and other equipment, not just running stuff.  Like I said, 10/10 do recommend."
15862,For a Wal-Mart it's very good.
15863,Live it!  Organized a layout are perfect.
15864,It had what i needed a new belt at.a good price
15865,"Of you can't afore what you want they'll sell you something you don't for even more money with there financing programs, friend wen it with there eye on a Chevy impala and they almost got them in to a ford car with an even higher price but wouldn't finance the older cheaper Chevy what a joke buy what you want not what they sell you ! You done go go to get oranges and come home with apples"
15866,Always friendly helpful staff
15867,Great selection of beautiful Alaskan fabric and friendly service. Perfect shop for locals and tourists alike.
15868,"The staff at Pablo's was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the coastal trail and nearby trail access.  And they wore face masks for COVID protection. I rented an e-bike which worked out nicely. The bikes were all in excellent condition."
15869,Love hiking and fishing here
15870,"Decent food, but bread is very soft and doughy so it compresses and sticks to your teeth.   Salmon chowder tasty but had some bones in it.  Ice cream is soft serve.  Same Alaska pipeline propaganda DVD kept looping which was sort of annoying"
15871,My wife and I come here often. Always wonderful.
15872,"I give very high praise to all of ALASKA DENTAL ARTS. They are courteous, friendly, prompt and thorough all with a genuine smile. I felt like I was in good hands. And I was, they helped me relax and we got through the procedure in less than an hour!! I send everyone asking about dentists to ALASKA DENTAL ARTS every time.  Thank you so very much for taking the 'scare' out of dentist visits."
15873,Cute clothes
15874,"(Translated by Google) Good service and a bit of everything in this place, very volatile.

(Original)
Buen servicio y de todo un poco en este lugar, muy vol√°til."
15875,Best wings in Alaska!!
15876,Good  value. Breakfast all day.
15877,Like Disneyland for homebrewers.
15878,"Thanks for the ride to Anchorage, Ak and back to Fairbanks during Thanksgiving!"
15879,"Good used gear and reasonable prices. Easy to sell excess equipment,"
15880,Fresh and tasty but small rolls
15881,"Bibimbap in the hot stone bowl with egg on top. Just like in Seoul, South Korea."
15882,Always has what I need and good stock of frozen veggies. And cheap toys or gifts for the kids
15883,Packed restaurant still had awesome service!!!
15884,Very helpful salespeople.
15885,Nice place. I was wondering why the Breakfast Burrito was $11.. and then it came..... and I knew.....
15886,A beautiful park not to be missed!
15887,Denali Natl. Park is seeing nature at its best.
15888,Needs longer hour of operation
15889,#1 MINI Dealer in Alaska
15890,Great haircut this morning
15891,"Polite, knowledgeable and respectful staff.... Well resourced specific to a wide variety of needs."
15892,A beautiful place...
15893,"As someone else said, you can't beat the price. Clean, well-maintained, always a pleasant experience. I sometimes find myself wishing they had certain pieces of equipment they don't, but I've never had to wait for a cardio machine. If you're an elite bodybuilder or athlete, you might have specific needs that this gym won't meet -- but for everyone else, this is more than sufficient.   Shower facilities could be better, but more than adequate. A lot of value for your dollar here."
15894,Amazing
15895,Its a Costco. You know!
15896,"(Translated by Google) Great triva night.

(Original)
Great triva night."
15897,"I've always received good service, but the quality of the food is hit and miss."
15898,Lots of neat stuff üòä
15899,Great people.  Limited car selection.
15900,Simply the best restaurant in Alaska!!
15901,"Paying Bills was relatively fast, just handed them the bill and check and was out of there less than 3 minutes. Lady was nice."
15902,"I tried to order something to be printed online. I called the store twice before ordering. I allowed my phone to find my area on the website. It sent my order to another state. So when I walked in to get my order, they asked me to send them the image and told me it would be done by 8:45 pm. I walked to Safeway to get food. When I came back, they then decided to put in my order at the back of the line and told me I would have to wait an additional 12 hours because ""it's not our fault that you messed up.""
Go to a local shop."
15903,"Great customer service, knowledgeable staff, and a good variety of weapons and gear!"
15904,Great Biscuits and Gravey.  Southern style.
15905,"Place where you can ask questions, find maps and see what is in town."
15906,Why are there never any cashiers? Simple as that.
15907,Budget rental car at the Anchorage Airport it's only about $30 not counting tax and insurance for a day's rental of a full-size vehicle but at the airport in Kenai the average cost is about $100 for a rental car of the same type for the same day much more expensive
15908,"Two options, one upstairs"
15909,Halibut was overcooked.
15910,"Good place to get materials, prices are ok, personal not too bad"
15911,I would love to see the poparbear feeding. Seen the back of them going back in. It was a real nice zoo.
15912,If you haven't tried them yet you are missing out! I normally go for the smoothies and grilled cheese sandwiches. Grilled cheese combo is the best!!! Im right next door and there couldn't have been a better place for lunches.
15913,"Pretty fast, but avoid going right at noon during the week days. The drive thru is stacked during that time. The people that work there are very nice."
15914,"Mmm, Eggs Benedict and mimosas, breakfast of champions! Make a reservation if you are going on the weekend!"
15915,"Awesome place to spend the day with kids and your pets toys to play on houses to explore and great food. Be sure to check what holidays the steam engine is working for the railroad the train ride, it is quite the experience!"
15916,"Since they gained ""competition"" across the intersection, they've just kinda went to pot. Used to be pretty fantastic, now it's just pretty dirty."
15917,Best breakfast in the Valley
15918,Great job
15919,"Great prices and good service. This theatre is a little dated, but it's a discount theatre. They provide you with more than you pay for."
15920,"I'm so disappointed constantly by this Wendy's. They have left out so many items so many times. I waited patiently throughout my entire drive through experience, in total about 9 minutes at this point, and then waited literally another 2 for a slow and nonchalant greeting again. They forgot my child's milk. Just to get all the way home to learn my entire $3 junior bacon cheeseburger wasn't important enough to make the bag.
It's not about the money, it's not hard to be cheerful in your customer service job, especially if packing 2 unaltered orders into a bag is difficult."
15921,Five years ago this company made awesome burgers but now they are cost cutting burgers.  It's a shame to see another good chain go downhill.
15922,"Bowling is great, bowling while drinking is better. This establishment is probably our best alley in Anchorage, but that really isn't saying much. The lanes regularly have technical issues and may misinterpret how many pins were knocked down during a roll. The food is pretty good for it being standard American fare, and the fries complement a pitcher of your favorite cheap beer.

That said, it is still bowling so you'll probably have a really good time."
15923,Appliance department has pretty good customer service
15924,"Sporting Clay's, walk thru, great place to shoot"
15925,Expensive tea accessories. Tea is well priced and a large selection. They also have spices and other gifts along that line.
15926,Great food!
15927,Very organized
15928,Awesome
15929,"Picked up from here and don't wait long, good job!"
15930,They have all the things and the staff is lovely
15931,My daughter's love their food
15932,"Friendly no pressure service.  They were very good at social distancing and had good health safety at the dealership.  They were responsive to questions, had an excellent home delivery service."
15933,Everything you need for your home
15934,"Ordered  2 to go pizzas by phone. Used the online menu to place the order. Online menu is easy to navigate and pictures are accurate.
Staff was professional and easy to understand. Meaning she spoke clearly and didnt mumble. 30 min wait, and staff was waiting inside to direct patrons to their ""station"" to pick up order. None to very little contact. Very impressed with how organized and proficient my short visit wS. Thank you Mosses Tooth  & staff for a job well done!!
Oh and our pizzas are delicious!! üòÅ"
15935,Order was on time and enjoyed my late night snack/dinner/lunch
15936,solid
15937,The couple who run the business is super nice.
15938,Good selection
15939,"Angel rocks is a really nice and romantic place the train starts off really gentle in flat if you take a path that goes left 3.5 mi it becomes a little more difficult and a lot steeper to climb than the right path 1.5mi, make sure you bring enough water because the 3.5 MI can get pretty steep if you do go up there with children keep a close eye on them because they will want to climb on all the rocks and you do not know if there is a large cut off on the other side. The signs are all so confusing because it does not show you the path that goes 1.5 miles so once you get to the top from the 3.5 five miles come to a sign that points to the trail that you came from and another sign that points to the trail that goes further but if you look perpendicular to the sign there's another path there and that is the 1.5 miles. Also another thing to be aware of is the dog owners who did you not pick up after their dogs and sometimes in the trail you may come across a little package try not to step in it and in the nice spots to take a break at the top there may be some surprises laying around up there"
15940,Slow not very helpful and bad customer service
15941,Not overly exciting but it has a nice staff and decent food.  Could be a great place for your large group to meet.  They have breakfast on your birthday which is nice for the budget conscious couples.
15942,Been here many times. Portions seem small this time around. Hopefully this trend doesn't continue.
15943,Love their pizza and salads!
15944,Good Chinese food and delivery service available in less than 1 hour.

15947,A bit of a wait but great service.
15948,Nice open place
15949,In need of a spark plug for the snowmachine? How about an air filter for the bobcat? Well they probably have what you need. Theres only a couple parts places in town and for the most part they seem to have just about everything in stock and will be competitive for price matching.
15950,"Great food, good drinks. It's a good idea tk have reservations for dinner or brunch. The brunch here is really great and has a wide variety if options. It's available Sunday 10-2 pm."
15951,"It was pretty fun. My son, my wife, and I went for a morning of arcade games and such. I am not sure I would go during full price hours. But in the morning when the games are half off, it was great. Played for several hours. There is not much at all for kids under about 5 to do. But otherwise I recommend it. I will probably go again another morning this summer."
15952,Best atmosphere freindly! Delicious
15953,"Great people, great prices. My go to storage facility."
15954,Gas not cheap in Alaska.
15955,"I love going here. Dr. Parliament and the staff does a great job at making you feel welcomed. The environment is really updated to modern standards and aesthetics.  Everything has been convenient and easy to navigate from scheduling to payment and follow up. After completing about 2 months of treatment and massage, my back feels completely 100% better that when I started treatment. I will be returning again if the time arises. Well worth it."
15956,"They have the best, most authentic, and delicious Philly subs here!!"
15957,It seems like they're customer services getting better and better and I had a guy drop what he was doing to run around and get all my shopping done for me yeah Christmas shopping all the kids toys and even more like I would have been there for maybe 3 hours looking for all that stuff but he took care of it and less than 30 minutes I want to say his name is Antonio so the Walmart could tell him thank you for me I greatly appreciate that
15958,Great karaoke on Thursday nights!!!!
15959,Recently remodeled. Restaurant needed an upgrade. Great customer service. Above average than others I've been to.
15960,"Good food , good service."
15961,Delicious crepes.  Love the smoked salmon and the creme br√ªl√©e.  I could eat here everyday.  Service friendly and efficient.

15963,Super store. Very large. Brand new.
15964,Food was good but their tables was less desirable
15965,I get the bread and locally roasted coffee brought to me in Anchorage and they are both excellent! Keep it up!
15966,Always the slowest Subway I've ever been to
15967,Very very crowded establishment. The Marionberry jam is tasty. The quiche of the day was quite delicious as well.
15968,"It's Kinkaid. It's awesome. If you haven't been, go. If you have, then you already know.

I recommend a Yeti dog."
15969,I absolutely loved the pizza that I ordered! It's not a good pizza unless the cheese stretches from every bite!
15970,Staff knowledgeable and very helpful. Hot exactly what we came for.
15971,"Quick check in system, waited about 5 minutes to be helped."
15972,Local business. Good service.
15973,Beautiful
15974,"I really love their pizza. I used to order once or twice a week, now not that often. But you should know if ordering online with a credit card you may have problems....like being triple charged for one order... I called back a out this and basically was called a liar, that it cant happen."
15975,Nice view of seaplanes
15976,The mall is a great place to shop last summer was there there was open places and I was wondering which new shops were going to get.
15977,"Excellent service, cozy atmosphere, fast internet. Everything one might expect from a Starbucks."
15978,Nice and clean store. This is the best Walmart we have been in.
15979,"My favorite diner anywhere may be Silk City in the Northern Liberties neighborhood of Philadelphia, so I have been thrilled to find Snow City here in Anchorage.
This is for sure top 3 faves in ANC. Despite the telling long waits for a table on weekend mornings, this a first choice treat for late breakfast.
Like any favorite, Snow City has fabulous food and excellent, professional servers.
Love Snow City!"
15980,Has a wide variety of many things you wouldn't think you would see in there and many things that are just strictly Alaska I start says a lot about Alaska
15981,Great tacos and delicious coffee. Perfect for after a rainy day hike!
15982,"Good beers, community events."

15985,One of the nicest Wal-Marts I've ever seen
15986,Enjoyable and relaxing
15987,"Clean rooms, nice professional staff, just a cool looking hotel. Definitely my preferred hotel to stay in Anchorage."
15988,"As with many places during this time AT&T is offering curbside service. As a mother of 2 under 3 I have utilized this service wherever possible.  Unfortunately, they have not executed it as well as many other places that offer this wonderful service.

Prior to arriving I called and had them set aside the things I wanted. Just a heads up, YOU CAN NOT PAY OVER THE PHONE.

I get there and call the store, press the button that corresponded with curbside pick up and after 3 attempts (first:  they hung up on me before asking my name, second: I gave them my name and what I had ordered, third: they called me because they didn't know where I was/ what I was driving). Even after that I still had to shout at them to bring the items to me.

When it came time to check out, apparently being 4 cars away from the building was too far so we had to walk to the front door to pay. And still, that was too far and the customer service representative had to take my card inside the building to pay for my items.

I'm not sure what convenience their curbside service is offering at the moment, but I have some suggestions for them:
1) have curbside dedicated parking (preferably closer to the building)
2) allow pay over the phone especially if you can't offer dedicated curbside parking
3) get better service/ signal for your workers to make payments especially if you can't offer the previous 2 suggestions. I'm sure there are reasons for it, but it just looks bad for a service provider to not be able to go 25 ft from the building and make a sale.

Ending on a positive, I will say that the people I originally talked to that pulled the items were helpful and friendly."
15989,"Decent hotel. Not great. Decent. Basic amenities, okay-ish breakfast. 5/10."
15990,Love this place!
15991,"Good food, bad service"
15992,I only ate at the restaurant so I'm not sure about the hotel. The food really was quite good and the service was also on par
15993,The waiting staff and bartenders are great
15994,"Big BX, large selection"
15995,Always great!
15996,Perfect quick stop.
15997,"For Arby's in the region, this group seems to stay ontop of everything, are personable & courteous. Clean environment & well made food."
15998,good tex-mex at a decent price
15999,I had Will put in a Idata start in my sons Subaru and he did a great job. Will takes his time and makes sure everything is installed and wired correctly.
16000,"Friendly service, chefs are always dishing out quality food, this is the place to go if you want delicious ramen/udon."
16001,Betty is amazing.
16002,They always take care of me
16003,"Everytime I stay here there's an issue. Time before this they gave someone else the keys to our room and we were nearly walked in on. This time the checked me out of the room on their own, hauled all my belongings off to housekeeping. I was able to recover them all but overall a not great experience. Front desk staff was very good about it all however. I just wish it didn't happen."
16004,Valerie is the best for taking me here before sending me back to the lower 48s. Great food here recommend the fish sandwich and shakes
16005,A place to lay all my troubles and talk to God.
16006,"Unusual cars, and more unusual to see the fashions that were worn at the time they were young."
16007,Good work on mufflers
16008,"(Translated by Google) This is the place for salmon fishing

(Original)
Das ist der Ort zum Lachseangeln"
16009,Beautiful hike
16010,"the food is delicious and the service was great! It is a very popular dining location (for good reason), and it was very busy. We were seated right next to another group of people,  so there was no chance of an intimate or private conversation."
16011,Good food and various meals that are appetizing
16012,"Best hotel in kodiak, clean rooms, friendly staff great location"
16013,"Transferred me three times on the phone before the order, showed up after 1.5 hours and the food looks like pig slop all smushed together on one side if the box. No napkins, no Pico, no forks, no clue , no stars! Maybe the're better if you walk in but avoid their delivery."
16014,Friendly staff
16015,Beautiful view.
16016,"Great food, fun servers
Nice view"
16017,"It's a dirty dump, needs a good cleaning"
16018,See Nistor and Dave McDonald for a quick and painless new truck purchase!
16019,Always great üëç sevice
16020,I think the Cost of the 'Red Bull smoothies' should be re-evaluated... Votes?... Or am I the only one that thinks that?.?.?
16021,Great place to see the aurora in the winter nice rock pool to heal all your aches and pains.
16022,"Read these reviews first!   Time for a better restaurant to move in.

Meh to nah.  Much better places to get a $16 burger.  Very boring burgers.  Some ""Legend"".  Even the bacon was blah.  Very little flavor; buggers are easy, right?  Canned mushrooms, seriously?  Same with the soup.  Yawn.  At least the pretzel was good, but the mustard and special sauce were kinda generic.

Stopped on a whim to get lunch for the crew.  No one finished the take out.  And the banned me from making take out decisions.

At least the service was friendly after getting attended too.

The tourist/puker crowd must keep that place alive.

We're going to Tommy's Burgers from now on.  That place is 6 stars - outta 2."
16023,Safe and fun place to shop! They have the best shops here
16024,The food is great
16025,"Always good food, friendly staff!"
16026,"Amazing food, great prices, and there napkins smelled amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
16027,The bread and cane sauce is delish!!
16028,Fitness folks will love the sAuana and steam. Nicest staff  to visit when staying in Anchorage
16029,"Love being able to buy in bulk, always love the samples of course! Everyone is friendly and helpful! Love their return policy as well!"
16030,Great coffee. Nice place to work.
16031,This is my go to home improvement store in Anchorage. It is great that they offer a 10% military discount.
16032,Worked here in 2014 looked up address on phone
16033,"What kind of Mexican restaurant does not serve horchata? Chili verde was sub par, no flavor and waaay too salty. My server was standard"
16034,"Arrived 40 minutes prior to closing to grab some quick eats and staff turned us away as they said they were closing up. He said only grubhub and online orders were being accepted, so we considered ordering from the parking lot, but didn‚Äôt since we were unwelcomed in store. Nothing online or in the store mentioned closing early. Could have been handled better. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend on service alone."
16035,One of 2 venues for shows and concerts
16036,Excellent service
16037,"The best family-ran, hole-in-the-wall restaurant & bar you'll find in Anchorage! Excellent food, exquisite drinks and a warm, inviting atmosphere can make this place feel like a second home!

A true hidden gem tucked away deep in Spenard, Fiori is the place to go for a long evening of food, drink and merriment. This is not a restaurant for a quick-bite to eat; it's an experience to be had where meals should be savored, drinks sipped and one can easily spend hours unknowingly.

A wide variety of excellent dishes make it hard to recommend any particular one, but the portions of each are always generous and something can be found to fit your current appetite.

The place truly shines behind the bar, with an extensive collection of wines and liquors backed by the best bartender in Alaska, Ylli Ferati. The man has mastered classic cocktails and has crafted an arsenal of his own amazing creations. If you're lost by the staggering amount of options, he'll find the right thing for you based on your taste! Enough can't be said about his collection of whiskies and knowledge thereof.

Truly an amazing place, better spent with a good company and a whole open evening to relax and enjoy the Fiori experience!"
16038,Waited a long time for my pizza and it was nothing like what I ordered
16039,"Usually no line, not an automatic car wash.  We usually go there when dirt and grime really stuck on as sprayer helps a lot."
16040,Literally the best massage I've ever had in my life. Her technique is fantastic and I am so relaxed and feel so much better. Thank you for listening and doing all the things I asked for. Can't wait to book another appointment! Thank you Tammy Jo!
16041,"The employees don't know where anything is and they'll just tell you we don't have it, all of them are rude and barely speak english. I know this is common."
16042,GOAT
16043,Nice place to shop for outdoor stuff
16044,"Quiznos isn't that far away, and far tastier.  I have never been a fan of Firehouse Subs, and I was even a fire fighter (so I guess I was obligated to try it)  neither knee, nor my wife enjoyed it.  The general consensus was Subway or Quiznos.  We just thought we would give it a try.

There were lots of people in there, the crew was friendly, but the food just didn't cut the mustard (whatever that ACTUALLY means)

They had a dining attendant who promptly wiped our table (as stated, they were busy, short turn over on tables).  She was friendly and brought our food over when it was prepared.

I don't think we will be back, not that they didn't try, it just was not to our liking."
16045,Great place for a classic American lunch !
16046,Great place to eat
16047,Not the same as Nordstrom.
16048,Good variety of food. Good service.
16049,Love this store chain.  Always helpful and they offer great values.
16050,I believe is best tasty fast food.
16051,"Great food and service! Also great for kids!! I've gone there for years, the dogs is always good!!! This is somewhere is definitely visit again and recommend to others. It's really a place the whole family can enjoy! It's a great environment too!!"
16052,"5 stars for service and atmosphere and a few of my favorite brews. That being said, I dont have much micro brew experience. I know all of our beer tenders and alot of our locals enjoy a pint or 2 after work most days. 2 PINT MAX.  ITS GREAT! Sometimes too noisy but avoid ""HAPPY HOUR"" and afternoons are peaceful and weekends vary. This is a great spot for a short social with friends and pooches ( yes, dogs allowed on a leash and good behavior) and little ones too ( no leash, but well behaved and with parents always) üôÇ. Enjoy a sample if your not sure. Like something and dont want to hang, get a growler to go or a ""medicine bottle"".T shirts, hoodies and souvenir glasses and other swag. You'll have to stop in and see. You may even admire/ purchase artwork from any one of local talented artists. Maybe even say hi to me.
Or check out those colorful sunrises"
16053,Quick service good fresh food.
16054,Did my first pickup order.  It's was so convenient and the staff were so nice!!!
16055,I was there for 5 hrs without food
16056,"Fantastic food, friendly staff, good atmosphere"
16057,"Very good, prices are reasonable."
16058,Couldn't believe the price of the 1/8-40$$$ with 20% THC. That's a deal to good to pass up
16059,Dan and his crew are truly rockstars! They went above and beyond expectations to repair my old car. They bought additional tools and spent time after hours to get me back on the road with a safe ride. I‚Äôm grateful to have such a friendly and customer service oriented business in my hometown. Keep up the good work and I will be back for sure.
16060,"Booze oh yeah, they have what you r looking 4"
16061,Always a great help on finding what I want
16062,Great bartender
16063,KaiLeigh is the best barista in Wasilla
16064,Normal Walmart but we got all food needed our Denali expedition. McDonalds with Denali burger inside of centre.
16065,Dont recomend
16066,Best damn Burger's in the state. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either woefully misinformed or trying to sell you something.
16067,"Usually we pick a good/great movie but we believe we waisted our money seeing ""Joker"". What a let down."
16068,Amazingly delicious and authentically Mexican food! You will not go wrong with any dish that you choose! Absolute favorite. I recommend this establishment to everyone!
16069,only for meat
16070,"These guys are the best! Timely and thorough work, professional attitude, and knowledgeable about their products ‚Äî all topped off with a great price. You couldn‚Äôt ask for better service. I will be going here for all my car electronics needs."
16071,Not a bad place. I was surprised at how small the theaters are. It seems a bit older. But it's movie theater. The line for snacks was super-long!
16072,Very organized store with people always willing to help you find the book you are looking for.
16073,"Great atmosphere, staff was pretty friendly. The food was good, not great and slightly over priced. I would probably go back again."
16074,Awesome parks
16075,I love Outback
16076,Honestly always spot on. Never had any hiccups since they opened after renovating. They are what you can expect and more from any other Wendy's around the country. I would go more if I could mentally accept all of the Dave's Doubles haha
16077,Amazing for food and desserts!  A new place to bring guests.
16078,Great location.
16079,Great food with large portions and reasonable prices.
16080,"(Translated by Google) I love the place is super cozy I like the decoration

(Original)
Me encanto el lugar es super acogedor me gusta la decoraci√≥n"
16081,Amazing place but seems there are always lines for the bathroom
16082,Very serene place to rest for a while or take a hike.
16083,busy
16084,I'm not even sure what's in this mall.
16085,Beautiful place
16086,"Not impressed.
Slow service and horrible food. $30 for shellfish fettuccini which consisted of 3 over cooked dry shrimp, 3 under cooked scallops, and a pile of dry noodles with cheese. No sauce whatsoever and very, very dry!
Took a long time to receive our ""reserved"" table and our food.
For the high price, and poor quality of the food and service, I will take my business elsewhere.
Also a very loud atmosphere. We had to almost yell just to have a conversation.
I highly recommend you skip this one! Not sure what all the hype is about."
16087,Got charged for a large coffee and go an midsized one
16088,Small and simple store
16089,having sushi with my son
16090,Good food. Excellent customer service!
16091,Great place
16092,Large variety of antiques at a reasonable price.
16093,I had a white chocolate mocha latte and my daughter had the fruit and cream crepe. It could have only been better if they made their own fresh whipped cream (it was the aerosol can kind) but both were still delicious. The restaurant itself was clean and bright and the service was great. We'll definitely be back.
16094,"Okay dept store, good grocery selection."
16095,Great service
16096,Friendly good service and good selection of sandwiches.
16097,Real PSL!
16098,"OK food, basic dinner food."
16099,Great service. Fast n friendly
16100,Expensive
16101,"Great senior breakfast. Homey, good service."
16102,"Good jumping off point for new families to the area. The staff and very nice and professional and address all repairs promptly. Rent is a little high for older townhouses that could use some interior remodeling, but they stay nice and warm in the winter and the roads stay plowed. I was freaking out when I found out about the blacklight inspection of the rugs and heard some horror stories. While we don't have a dog, I was potty training a toddler. But Nature's Miracle and a wet dry vac is all you need to stay on top of it. They were really great and accommodating in the end."
16103,"Usually have every part I come to need, in stock. I usually call all four auto stores when looking for prices, and I go with O'Rielly's 98% of the time. If you have an import - Toyota, Subaru, Honda, Mitsubishi.. they probably have your parts in stock."
16104,Awesome food
16105,Awesome store
16106,"great burgers and french fries, didn't cost am arm and a leg and was wonderful! the service fast and friendly!"
16107,Costco was great the wife and I got a membership I Miss Lori was really really nice
16108,I‚Äôve gotten a few tattoos here and always leave so happy. You wont leave without a good laugh and a satisfied experience. Wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else!
16109,Overpriced
16110,"My husband and I went here for the first time, around 1pm to use our vouchers from the radio station. We sat outside, ordered drinks, appetizers, and hoagies. We got our drinks and appetizers shortly after, but then it took another 45 minutes to get the hoagies. Our waitress was very friendly and apologetic, thanking us for our patience. Im hopeful that they were just having some sort of difficulties that day, and that was not a normal wait time. I will go back and try again, the food was worth it."
16111,"Very bland and chewy ""chicken"".  Avoid at all cost.  I've rarely ever thrown an entire meal away, it was easy with this one."
16112,Always have loved this location..even tho I should be staying away from fast food; cant help it when the customer service is great and the food is always made correctly!
16113,Thorough and thoughtful! Even in -4 Fahrenheit! They honor the promise of redoing the wash (only happened once) due to freezing weather!
16114,"Decent Mexican food, but the quality is high"
16115,I came in to use the bathroom. It was very clean. Then I just had to have a meal. Yumm
16116,Nice paved trail.  Crews are working on the trail clearing trees near the path.  I saw a moose..  Nice nature walk with some elevation changes.
16117,"I am a regular at both locations. Today I got to Sara's too at 6:58pm. The store closes at 7 p.m. as I got close to the door, I saw two employees run and lock the doors and turn off the lights. If you don't want to serve another customer, close to closing just say so. Lameüòî"
16118,Great people! Decent food
16119,Great
16120,I have purchased a lot of furniture from these guys over the years.  Great customer service and easy to deal with.  Thanks!
16121,It's fun
16122,Meh.  The nice imported decor doesn't make up for mediocre food.  Not bad by any means just wouldn't go out of your way to try this place.
16123,"Food is a little oily and greast, but it tastes good and doesn't leave you feeling sick."
16124,pretty girls great coffee excellent service win / win!
16125,"Free boot stretching up to 3 times with your perches, you find that service at foot locker lol but I half to say you will be paying for that premium quality it's not as bad as some places but it's a true boot shop they sell quality not quantity!"
16126,I never feel welcome here.
16127,"Excellent repair and great, friendly service.  I called a competitor for a second quote that was three times higher than Denali Glass.  These guys got me in for repairs on very short notice since we live well north of town.  My highest recommendation!"
16128,The pizzas üçï are always good and they are made fast! The store on Ft Wainwright is our favorite.
16129,"New place, nice people."
16130,Always nice and clean.Fun for family
16131,Best buffet in town
16132,Comfortable.
16133,Wish I had more money...  haha!
16134,"It was quick, they are nice, and most especially the service was free"
16135,"Was here for Octoberfest, what a fun time! Traditional food and lots of Paulaner!"
16136,Nice spot in town to grab a quick latte
16137,Not very many selections. Not very good quality.
16138,Found the area in the car that was causing a foul odor  - we couldn't find it ourselves.
16139,Friendly & cheerful service
16140,Knowledgeable staff. Clean and well stocked.
16141,"Unsure... been here a few times. Too many kids running around. Upscale chuck e cheeses... wish they kicked them out sooner than 10, so we could drink and be merry, and not have 12 year olds with their parents debit cards and stupid hair cuts running around. Foods is ok. Service is slow. Drinks are  overpriced."
16142,Petroleum Club is members only but they hold lots of business meetings for the public. Great food and service in a relaxed atmosphere.  Below is Red Dress dinner function 2 days ago.
16143,High prices
16144,Fast.. I had to travel the same day to Fairbanks. The did it in an hour!.  Best price in town! .  Exceptional customer service.
16145,Quick and courteous
16146,Great food & Service. The bbq sticks are so good. I always get at least 2 of those on the side üòä
16147,They didn't have what I wanted and couldn't or wouldn't order it.
16148,"Usually pretty clean, otherwise there's not much to say."
16149,Fun and funny!
16150,"Today was good? But the last 2 washes were a ripoff, was out of spot free, left car all spotty! Also ran out protectant,  had to run to another wash facility, both times cost me double,"
16151,I love the selections available. And they always have great seafood at decent prices.
16152,"One of my favorite pizzerias is this company great service, military friendly, good pizza and it represents Alaska."
16153,"This is a run of the mill family restaurant or greasy spoon. The food is more for drunk people or people with a hang over. The food is plain, not seasoned well and just pretty typical of an out of the freezer eatery. The staff seem fairly nice though."
16154,Great service from Pat.
16155,Alot of cool stuff
16156,Very good food trust me try the cinnamon delights there so delicious and sugary
16157,"Cute, local place with a taste burger and amazing milkshakes."
16158,Wish they still served beer and wine but I guess the kids like it.
16159,Love the Irvin pottery at the fair.. Great food and wonderful music.
16160,Loved going here but since this whole covid thing and hour change cant get to it. Would like to be able to go after work but I'm not off until 12 or 1am.
16161,"Pretty good place to stop in an eat if you feel like not cooking. Really good food, but it's still just a breakfast food place to me. Service is great, waitress's are nice an friendly. Great place to go if your feel like eating breakfast still food. I go here usually once every couple weeks."
16162,A wide variety of interesting pizza and open late. We chose one at random and were not disappointed.
16163,"I dont see how this place is so popular, although i assume most people cant tell quality steak. Just another chain."
16164,We ordered crispy tacos and they were quite soft.
16165,"Most amazing view! And a great little roadside to eat, grab a good cold beer while exploring the area."
16166,My wife and kids and I enjoy eating here. Great mongolian bbq and buffet.
16167,"Typical menu and offerings of the chain for basics at a reasonable price, slightly above average in service and food preparation at least for breakfast. This location is well run and has menu options that let you build your own breakfast which was refreshingly nice."
16168,"LOVED this hike. About 1.5rt or so, pretty easy start, only harder part is getting through the rock field, either climb over or walk around through the water. The ice cave is absolutely stunning to see!"
16169,Thanks for all of your work on the job done by this morning and I'm happy help with your work
16170,Great brands good discounts
16171,"They have great service, its clean and the food it good."
16172,Young kids always have fun.
16173,"I want to like this diner. I want to love this diner, because it is my new local diner. However, the food is extremely bland and greasy. I've tried 5 times now to love them and it isn't even a chance at liking. The service is mediocre at best, the pies taste like something from a grocery store freezer, not something homemade. The breakfasts are over greasy and everything tastes like the grill, no individual flavors to enjoy. The meatloaf, which is a personal favorite, definitely needs improvement. Denali Diner or Windbreak are still my go to diners."
16174,The sushi boat had nice cuts of fish but rather plain rolls. The sake selection is pretty diverse and as sweet sake goes the plum and the apple were delicious. Mongolia beef was a nice balance with tender meat.
16175,Delicious food!!!!!!
16176,Oh my God is this place GREAT.... FOOD and SERVICE!!!!!!!
16177,Rented in August. Vehicle was present snd in good condition. No problems at all. BE SURE to take photos before AND after drop off.
16178,Great food and waitress(Allison).
16179,my husband loves this place
16180,Food was good. Not enough crab legs for the price!
16181,Food was awesome! The only complaint I have was that they brought my salad and main course too close together.
16182,"Amazing selection of beads, charms and jewelry finding. Owner is super nice and friendly"
16183,They never get my order correct. The food is put together haphazardly with no regard for presentation nor do they give you the accurate order. I have come here many times but never again. I can give numerous stories as to what has happened on all my visits but I will not waste my time or yours. Do not go here. Horrible customer service horrible food horrible accuracy horrible wait time. I love Taco Bell but just not this one.
16184,Grocery store
16185,"Welcome to Alaskan Walmart, where prices are high and so are the people.

Yeah, it's okay."
16186,Beautiful scenery in
16187,Good take out
16188,Service is fast. So many spices and seasonings I just can't get anywhere else. Great food and Kaladis too?!? Yes please!
16189,Everything good except sometimes prices are a bit high for my budget.
16190,Pet mega store
16191,"Good food and drinks, pleasant environment"
16192,Best hot wings in Anchorage!
16193,"My van broke down on the side of the Thruway I was able to Coast off, I saw the tow truck driver unloading a vehicle I was able to speak with him call the office they had me loaded up within 15 minutes and off to the repair shop, I am beyond thankful to the whole crew for getting me back on the road. Andrew is the man!"
16194,"Great coffee, very friendly service, and quick too! Love this place. I've ordered everything from mochas to lattes, and smoothies. I have never been disappointed."
16195,Great food
16196,Love this place. Great food and staff. Sushi M-F 5-9
16197,"Good food, lots of TV screens, football was on so it was packed and loud, service was good as well."
16198,Place was clean and workors was nice. Food and drinks are expensive. Theater was nice and clean and over all it was good experience.
16199,"Walmart, has what you need st an ok price.  My go-to place."
16200,"A classic style hotel. Old but well maintained, small bar/restaurant at the lobby free airport / hotel shuttle. Hotel have a breakfast, also the staff is friendly but some times it seem like they are so stressed that customer service disappear. Maybe management can improve this. Since there is always room for improvement. Remember this is a 3 star hotel."
16201,Great staff. Appreciated how much knowledge  they had for buying a electric rolling machine for the first time. And what kind of tobacco to get that's similar to the brand I smoke.
16202,Loved our Captain Tiff from Hawaii. Very knowledgeable and interesting tour
16203,The park is dirty  its a burn car park on the parking lot
16204,"I have usually enjoyed my experiences here. One time I had a not so friendly encounter with a not so friendly manager who said their burger machine was broken and we should leave because it would take 2 hours for burgers to come out? Everyone else was getting their food, so we decided to order. We got our burgers right on time, but we felt pretty discriminated against. Every other time I have been there, I have really enjoyed it however, and will definitely go back next time I find myself down in Anchorage"
16205,"Good food, clean place, good atmosphere!"
16206,"Great selection of clothing for everyone, but one of the workers was snobby."
16207,Great
16208,I went after work. Gave them a quick call she said come on in at 730.. I have terribly damaged hair since i dye it so much but my stylist was up for the challenge very nice and knowledgeable she gave me a great trim and fresh layers. She recommended this olyplex(?) moisturizing/bonding treatment im trying this friday
16209,Swift service. Huge slices. Great prices.
16210,Great people watching on Karaoke nights. Drinks are too high and bouncers are douches.
16211,Fast and friendly. Best Crab Rangoon in Anchorage!
16212,"Newly remodeled gas stop in Trapper Creek.  As of recently (2020), the gas here is usually about 2 cents cheaper than in Talkeetna.  They have a cage that acts like a ""dog run"" but is more like a ""dog prison"".  I guess it's the thought that counts.  I havent been inside as I dont usually frequent gas station convenience stores because they're expensive.  The gas prices are good, and that's why I stop."
16213,This is one of my go to sushi spots because I know it's always good.
16214,Always helpful staff that ask the right questions to get you exactly what you need.
16215,Probably the cleanest McDonald's in Alaska
16216,They have doorman parts on the shelf and most of my automotive needs without having to wait
16217,Good service
16218,"Excellent food,"
16219,"Books are everywhere here, on the walls, on the tables, I mean everywhere. The more books you help clean out of this place, they just go out and get more to replace them... Seriously has more books laying around than my kids room. It's getting to be a problem that they might want to get some professional help for."
16220,"I saw guest speaker Kevin Pierce at Awesome NYO on Saturday, venue was very nice!"
16221,"Awesome service and staff. They were so helpful and honest about my tires. I went to get a tire change over from winter to summer tires and brought to my attention that my summer tires were too old and cracked and instead of just putting them on, which would have been unsafe and possibly cause more problems, they gave me numerous options and quotes for new and used tires. They did not try to push them on me at all and even tried finding me some tires from other locations. Anybody who is willing to send me to another business even if it is not their own to help me out earns my respect! I also had to reschedule on one of my cars literally last minute and the front desk staff were very helpful and kind and had no problems doing it. I unfortunately do not remember the names of the three gentlemen that work in the garage but they were very helpful as well and were great on giving me all the info I need about my tires and getting new ones. When I get new tires I will only go to Alaska Tire they have earned themselves a life time customer! Keep up the good work guys you are much appreciated!!!"
16222,This place is huge with plenty of sports television monitors. It also offers Creek view seating with is beautiful. Bar service was good. We did not eat a meal.
16223,So much fun! Laurie was so awesome! We had a great time!
16224,Nice location with knowledgeable people prices are below average.
16225,Nice pavilion. Great fishing
16226,"A cute little bar, was here to watch my home state Rams play in the Super Bowl. Love the logo of this place. The beer list includes local brews. Very nice decor. I didn't try the food aside from the tater tots, which were okay."
16227,Best knee replacement surgery ever
16228,Awesome on black friday
16229,Ok 4 grandkidos
16230,I had the chicken casidea it was ok. But the CHEESE BERGERS are the best thing on the menu
16231,Clean!  Friendly Service! Great food!
16232,Helpful staff
16233,"Local art, comics, and tabletop games. A nerd oasis in the soggy wilderness."
16234,"The only problem is the prices, but you're getting what you pay for.
Every meal here is delicious. Portion size is great. Drink selection is great.
Events are very fun here too."
16235,"Really good! Not the best soft serve I've had, but it's good enough! They have many options to choose from. Their prices are steep. Staff are friendly."
16236,Watch out for speed traps
16237,"Awesome rooms, friendly staff, great service and a real good breakfast included. A highly recommended place in Anchorage."
16238,"My, my, this resort is a heaven sent place, I have been coming here since a child. They never cease to perform."
16239,"Good customer service, pizza."
16240,"Sandwiches were good,  the fries terrible, Luke warm & under cooked"
16241,This place has the BEST! breakfast burritos!
16242,Great gym and never too busy. Caters more towards cross fit and overall fitness than powerlifting or bodybuilding.
16243,"Beautiful atmosphere and very friendly and professionally staffed. Great chefs and just an overall great experience. I made a last minute reservation request and brought my own desert and they went above and beyond. Will definitely be going back. They have it decorated for the Christmas holiday, which makes it a special experience. Thank you Sun for a beaufiful evening!"
16244,"They do a really good bacon cheeseburger, and they have tasty fries and onion rings. Not a place that one would associate with high end dining, but the food has always been on point every time I stop in."
16245,"I ordered take out Dinner Vegetarian Thali - total it was about $19. The rice dessert it came with was really yummy and so was the super orange looking curry. The chickpea curry was too spicy for my taste, though delicious, and the yellow curry was tasty but a bit spicy as well. I have a low spice tolerance though so that's on me.
The Dinner Vegetarian Thali also came with a side of bread (super yummy), some cooling yogurt-like dip (really balanced out the spicy curries), and what looked like an oversized  tortilla chip (somehow super flavorful and good). I loved the variety and the balance of flavors. Dinner Vegetarian Thali is an entire three course meal in itself. It was a healthy, flavorful, and felt authentic. I wouldn't mind coming back. Next time I'd like to sit inside with all the colorful walls."
16246,Gross. Kids love it tho.
16247,This okay is fantastic! You'd have to drive hundreds of miles to find a better store!!!!
16248,Love the Subway
16249,Great day cruise. Good lunch and good service.
16250,Good varieties
16251,Great place. Lots to choose from .Excellent customer service.
16252,Zoo was nice. But better views of the animals were had at the Alaska Wildlife Preserve.
16253,"Auto trim did good. They installed a cover on a pickup we lost a hold down bolt they replaced the lost parts ""free"" I was in a hurry. Got the parts no hassle an hauled back home in case it was needed.put it back and we're  üòé üÜíÔ∏è!"
16254,"This isn't a 5 star establishment, but they do a great job with what they have. They definitely have more of a bed and breakfast feel instead of a hotel feel. Home cooked breakfast was included! The rooms were old fashioned but accommodating and the host was very nice."
16255,To many homeless people all over outside
16256,Friendly atmosphere! Great food! Amazing service!!!
16257,Wonderful food and service.
16258,Awesome burrito. Delicious milk shakes.
16259,"Nice selection just overpriced like a larger care lot it's worth a look tho they tend to cater to a higher quality end user, but at a price range you'll think maybe I just buy new?"
16260,Terrific desserts! Would have given 5 stars but the heat was off in the bar area and we were freezing!!! Went through the restaurant on the way out and they were all sweating. Go figure?!? The outside temp was only around 0 so not during the bad cold.
16261,Great portions
16262,Loved it. Fun. Great food vendors
16263,Excellent park
16264,"The sesame chicken was awesome, gave the Mongolian beef a B-. The service was great."
16265,"We didn't really care for the onion rings or tots, too greasy. Burgers were ok. Fun combinations.  They let me order my burger without a bun so I could scrimp on calories with my bacon and avocado burger.
They advertised Turkey burgers on their menu, but didn't have any."
16266,love this place. great food. Awesome service
16267,It was good food and hospitality
16268,The drive thru window is very slow.
16269,As always...great food and great service. The hefeweizen is fantastic!
16270,Beautiful
16271,"Looks run down, but the donuts are great!"
16272,"Been there twice now, both for birth dinners. Very excellent service, and the food is amazing!! I don't recommend the potato fingers (I think that's what they are called), they are a tiny portion with no flavor and I was not impressed at all but the desserts and main courses are fantastic!!  Would definitely go back!"
16273,Great drinks food and service
16274,There's always a long wait and the cell service is terrible so make sure you bring something to do.
16275,"While the service was OK for Fairbanks, the meal was poor. Watered down Au Jus with a ""Prime Rib"" sandwich that was served on what appeared to be a soggy hot dog bun. The ""prime rib"" was not prime rib, although the price would lead you to believe it was. Salads were limp and relatively flavorless. Even our coffee afterwards was weak. Very few restaurants in Fairbanks offer great service and great food...Pikes is not one of them. Spend your money at Silver Gulch or  the Turtle Club."
16276,Excellent! We washed our camping trailer there.
16277,They have decent vegetarian options and rich food. Sides are portioned smaller to help prevent food waste and made bottomless so the customer can still feel that they received their money's worth.
16278,Loved it!
16279,Attentive staff
16280,We enjoyed our visit here and the foods were awesome. Service was great and the views were excellent. You will not be disappointed by the seafood or vegetables. Beverages were varied and excellent.
16281,"The best sushi Ive had in a long time. The sushi is so fresh and tasty, no hard rice or off colors. Also the crab rangoons are cooked to perfection, not too hard nor too soft. Will defintely come back in the future to try more food!"
16282,Always been a usual for me
16283,Excellent service for in store purchases and ordering is easy with them.
16284,Had a blast.
16285,Loved the front desk totally satisfied with how a person should be treated
16286,Great food!
16287,One of the most beautiful views in the whole state.
16288,I don't know what the hype was about when I heard the commercial. I had lemon pepper wings and they weren't seasoned.
16289,Great selection of wines that you won't find anywhere else in Alaska.
16290,Friendly environment took kids to check out the critters we all enjoyed
16291,never had a bad meal there
16292,If it's nunaka Valley then they have lots of ballfields lots playgrounds
16293,"Fast, polite and helpful."
16294,Love the prices and the people are super nice
16295,Ok food was cold
16296,"Friendly employees, nice, bright, Clean restrooms."
16297,Fun salmon feast.
16298,small park
16299,We ate  at fatburger today first of all the hamburger patty was real beef nothing fat about the meat the burger was full of cut up lettuce tomato and pickle. It was good but nothing spectacular.
16300,"Place is good, prim rib chicken fried steak is where it's at! Good coffee, but the OJ served here is a little upsetting. Let's step it up a notch and serve some real Orange Juice. Orange juice from concrete only does OK when made as a screw driver. As for my OJ with breakfast Simply Orange or Tropicana... That to expensive or what?"
16301,"I love the food and they have fantastic staff! New location isnt the same, but the food is still delicious!"
16302,String of car break in's recently. Would advise to stay away or don't leave anything out in the open.
16303,"I'm here on vacation from Turlock Ca, I was looking for a good restaurant. This is a nice, cozy,friendly place to come for a late dinner. There food is good and there serving are big. Glad I found this place..."
16304,Always nice to stop when headed out of soldotna
16305,"Just order 2 hamburgers, 6piece nugget w/2 sauces, and small fries and paid $10.41. But what I recieved was 2 cheeses burgers (wrapped in hamburgers wrapper paper), extra salty fries, and overcooked cold nuggets. Also, the person who handed me my food never greeted or said thank you. She just didn't speak to me. Very disappointed with them."
16306,"I've had Dr. Lewis and Dr. Grimstad both take care of my dogs and they are fantastic! The front desk staff and techs were all great too. Professional, friendly, and clear about options and cost of care. I definitely recommend them to everyone."
16307,"I love the bakery, food is always good and friendly staff. We go back whenever we are in Fairbanks"
16308,Always a beautiful hike
16309,Very handy place for your building needs especially Roofing
16310,September set menu was divine from start to finish
16311,"Cozy, vibrant atmosphere, southwest burro is a 7, cool blue grass group of musicians performing, nice Lil selection of books,  amazing idea from the creators and a perfect historical,  hipster,  Artie fartsy location to have it in.  Your Wi-Fi needs helps."
16312,Always good sales
16313,"Excellent pizza, amazing Salmon spread!"
16314,Fun place for a weekend getaway. Very neat seeing all the self sustaining technology.
16315,"Nice gym, what I expect from a Planet Fitness. Bathrooms and locker rooms are clean. Good variety of machines. Sometimes a bit crowded, but not too bad."
16316,"Great store!  Spendy, but has something for everyone."
16317,The name has now changed to Hilcorp.  Security was nice and efficient to get our badges.
16318,It's really fun there but the dip in dots were sold out but I highly recommend to go on the master blaster
16319,"Had to fill a script while travelling so stopped by this location. the store is new and clean but it took 4 hours to fill a script. The staff was very friendly about that ordeal but overall slow pharmacy. Also, because I wasn't going to wait that long in the store, I kept calling for updates and I couldn't speak to a human ü§î"
16320,"The ambiance is outstanding, food was delicious.   It's a very unique little surprise in the Valley!"
16321,Ease to use and the price is good too.
16322,Good food.  Great service.
16323,This store is a crafters dream come true! Prices are great thank goodness....even tho i still spend waay too much there! Definitely recommend this place!
16324,Ok
16325,Date night
16326,"Love everything about the place, except that it doesn't deliver. Good pizza but often a wait because everyone loves it. If you are in a hurry the sell individual slices."
16327,"Definitely a hit and miss with somethings.. the pan pizza, and pizza rolls are never fresh. Pasta sometimes doesn't have enough sauce or noodles.. if you order online there are some things that you cannot modify"
16328,"Its McDonald's, what else can ya say.. quality really depends on who's working & if they like their job or not"
16329,Overpriced
16330,Amazing fries
16331,Awesome selection of booze!
16332,"Best Japanese food in Anchorage, definitely recommend you try it once."
16333,"Alice's has had great food in the past. They may have great food again in the future. But they haven't had great food there for awhile. It's a shame really because after they reopened they never really got back to being the great Alaskan bar of yore but at least they had really good food. Now they've lost that. The building is cool, the folks who with there are nice, but it's too much of a restaurant to be a great bar, and the food is no longer good enough for it to be a great restaurant."
16334,"Fun, informative and interesting!"
16335,Great fishing
16336,The girls in the back could not be more rude. The girl.up front fabulous. Will never ship anything with them again. Much nicer people elsewhere.
16337,"Now granted, this is not fine dining. This is IHOP, and as IHOP's go, this one is pretty good. The server was friendly. Our table was clean. The restroom was clean. We we're a party of 2, and the server was nice enough to let us know that she'd just seated a group of 12, so we might want to hurry & get our order in. That was thoughtful. Also, the strawberry French toast was really yummy! :)"
16338,Lots of selections to choose from
16339,"(Translated by Google) The best Margarita in the city

16340,Loved it
16341,"Casual, relaxing atmosphere with an intoxicating presence that whispers fun. My wife & I had the halibut basket. It was perfect for 2. Sitting on a mountain of fries, the big, juicy , flakey nuggets of halibut were dipped and fried. Yummmy. We'll be back. Might save room for one of those delicious looking desserts next time."
16342,Great location. Lots of activities.
16343,It was my very first time waking that trail out to the infamous rope swing I heard about when I was a teenager and I loved it! It's very well kept and the lil bits of info all around were great. Thank you Christopher ‚ù§Ô∏è for taking me out there. 143 üòò
16344,We were told of the magnificent view on Mt.Denali from the deck. We were lucky passing the mountain with a clear view of the top. The deck was a good place to enjoy.
16345,This place has everything pluse more
16346,Delicious menu and homemade bread
16347,Great food at a great price. They even have food for vegetarians!
16348,"Small but spacious theaters with reclining chairs. They are not automatic, but still comfy! The theater is a little bit older but it was still clean. We enjoyed our time."
16349,Food was good and the games were fun.
16350,Great informative facility. A must visit.
16351,"Cool art, good coffee and pastries. The atmosphere is really chill. Good vibes fs"
16352,"I ordered a custom cake the day before (at Midtown Walmart), even though they were super busy, they still kindly accepted my request. The cake was exactly I requested, it was very yummy too! A+++++

the baker/employee who took my order from the
phone and the person who handed me the cake when I picked it up were both sweet, friendly and helpful, I wish I got their names.

Also, Walmart Bakery have the best garlic bread!"
16353,"Not as many flowers or Alaska plants as I expected, but still fun to visit."
16354,""" The Best Wings in Town """
16355,Every visit is different..
16356,Every meal i have tried there has not disappointed. The food can take a little long to get but that's because they make it fresh. The service is always great.
16357,Great service
16358,Food Just done right
16359,It gets the job done but it smells like mold real bad and the carpet is stained.
16360,"They were able to serve a huge group of folks in a reasonably short period of time, and mine was delicious."
16361,Good food.
16362,Quaint local hangout. Friendly service. Recommended.
16363,Little gem tucked away in downtown Girdwood. Rotating menu. Comforting soup and hearty sandwich were perfect on our way from Anchorage to Kenai. Worth the detour.
16364,Great location for outdoor enjoyment
16365,Great food!!
16366,Good service good weed
16367,I've been going here for about 7 years now. The nail technician Mike is THE BEST in town. I HIGHLY recommend!
16368,Prices are already good whatever you need is there
16369,"Maybe better if it was season without covid. Very distent staff , very sleepy area. No working ice machine an no house keeping .. o an pay 20$ a day for wifi for the price I would have stayed at McKinley cabins a few miles down the road"
16370,Good crowd and music.
16371,"I've purchased gas and items at this store for 10 years, today a red haired lady charged me .50 cents for a cup of ice. I haven't been charged for a cup of ice anywhere else I've ever been. If people are that petty, they simply lose my business. Poor, sullen attitude as well. Sadly disappointed, won't ever go back. Dumb business move."
16372,This restaurant is just delicious! The environment is very cozy! The owner and staff are always friendly! You will truly enjoy your experience here!
16373,"Great selection of necessities and then some, wonderful native crafts as well."
16374,"Well, McDonald's is a fast food restaurant with OK quality it might never get a five star but it's fine if you are in a hurry."
16375,Its closed
16376,"If you were a fan of the original Wings 'N Things,  then you will love this one. They have the original recipes. So freaking delicious!!!"
16377,The one on south cushman its ok during the day but at night to many bad elements
16378,"Very good food, but a tad expensive. My waiter was extremely polite and professional."
16379,Absolutely delicious! The staff is so kind and community oriented. I‚Äôm always impressed!
16380,"Got us into a lot more car than we expected. Always refreshing to see someone go above and beyond. Ask for Bobby Easterwood, he was great!"
16381,I have had a few dinners here and as always Unbelievable service! Food was amazing! Egg rolls out of this world
16382,"Great food, even better service.  Always makes for 2 meals"
16383,"Food was wonderful! I felt weird walking inside wearing my hiking gear though, thank goodness for no dress code"
16384,Good booze
16385,Love it
16386,"Great staff üëç
Good place to get your ride on ü§úü§õ"
16387,"I definitely like this place, staff is always friendly and the food is good. It would be nice if they had spicier options (Arizona born) but otherwise pretty solid."
16388,I love their dessert selections and the deals are really great
16389,Good place. Decent price. In and out. Will go again.
16390,"Staff is phenomenal!! Appetizers and sides are outstanding. Very disappointed in the rib eye and grilled shrimp. Very blah. The ""butter"" served with grilled shrimp, was not butter. Had a oil taste. Yuck."
16391,Selection isn't that great.
16392,Update / not a restaurant: they've removed the kitchen. There is no food menu at all. This is only a bar now. / The food menu is not huge but it has some interesting selections. I tried the Curry Fries and they were good. They were out of fish and chips which seems odd for an Irish pub. We were a large group but received very good service.
16393,"Wonderful place, Absolutely a pleasure meeting the owner.

Hidden away in a sense but SO worth it.

Thank you for your cheerful demeanor and honorable characteristics.

May you have a wonderful day, and i encourage you to visit üòä"
16394,"Great location. Helpful knowledgable staff and they have everything in stock! Appointment required but that saves time in the long run, not wasting time"
16395,"A standard Target. Typical stuff, with typical staff. They have a reasonable selection for a Target, and a moderate selection of food items also. They do not have as broad a selection as I have seen in other Targets, and they do not have as much mid-range stuff as I usually expect."
16396,"Great service, food was fantastic! They also had the best take home , left  over box I had ever seen in a restaurant!"
16397,Yum!
16398,"Went to"" The War with Grandpa"".Friday Oct. 9th... Its Coronavirus time and there were less than 10 people at the 4:10 showing.  All socially distanced of course.  The workers did a great job (even the new guy at the concessions standüôå).  The place appeared well cleaned."
16399,Amazing atmosphere
16400,Gardening
16401,Well it's subway
16402,"Excellent campground, with access to hiking & amazing scenery."
16403,Great food in a pleasant neighborhood
16404,"Great service, great selection of popular foods plus some local stuff like the halibut burger, salmon etc. We had the fajita steak breakfast burrito and it was fantastic. coffee is great too. Not sure if she was the waitress or owner or manager but she was awesome and has a great sense of humor."
16405,Seems this place is always going in and out of business. Food was okay not the best Asian cuisine.
16406,"Until You Visit, You Cannot Understand How Good This Food Is!"
16407,They are never around in the mornings to be able to put my dog to sleep. This is the third time I have tried this. This time though there was two people standing inside the building and of course they don't come over to see if they can help they just looked at me with stupid blank expression. Then when we had a stray cat problem they said we would be charged $75 for the cat trap WTH its not our cat we shouldn't have to pay that people are getting lazy and don't seem to care no more
16408,Great place to ship out any kind of packages anywhere in alaska. Great staff with customer service skills. Quick.
16409,Amazing!!!!!! The girls are a big help when you only have two hands. Very professional and well-mannered.
16410,"Really expensive for what they offer. There wasn't much to do, but my 3 year old had fun. :) I just wish it didn't cost so much to do so little."
16411,A place to dump.
16412,"Update: Brought from 4 stars to 3. The hashbrowns are always inconsistent! Sometimes they are great and other times terrible.

Pancakes were delicious of course! Tea wasn't great but ok. Water in the bathrooms needed to get warmer. However, the whole experience wasn't bad. Only place to get breakfast at 7pm on the South Side."
16413,"Worst post office on earth!!!  When you walk in the door you have to line up like children or prisoners, snakeing around the minuscule room while they look all over the whole facility for every package.  I have to go here in 2 hours and I completely dread it."
16414,"Outside pool was good, a little too many people. The ice museum was cool but drinks are WAY over priced. Unfortunately also, we booked a cabin that we were told we would be able to cook in, but it had been winterized already, huge bummer. Read or ask about the fine print. Pretty over priced in our opinion, customer service could use some work too, not very friendly at all."
16415,Pretty dang cozy and very affordable. Their sandwiches are pretty dang good. The service was very attentive as well
16416,Great place and good selection üëç
16417,Always really nice staff and red bulls are amazing.
16418,Prompt friendly service. Food was decent.
16419,Great place to shoot!
16420,Beautiful. So much worm put into the grounds. The church is over the top AWESOME
16421,"Good service, the cashiers are very nice too."
16422,Awesome place
16423,Make sure to ask for Megan! Best hair cut in anchorage
16424,"Love this place, best malted milkshakes amywhere"
16425,No good for tent camping.  If you have a motorhome it's a nice place.
16426,"Delicious, authentically prepared, seasoned great, cooked well Mexican cuisine, friendly+attentive+professional staff, enormous variety of foods & beverages, cocktails, there is a bar if you would just like to do  that. An array of desserts & prices are reasonable."
16427,"LOVE THIS THEATER!!!‚ù§small, so every seat is like front row.  Local talent, easy parking, NOT downtown.  ( better for me)"
16428,Great bread
16429,Reasonable prices
16430,Great service and I always get that at home feeling.
16431,"Decent food, and personable staff."
16432,They were helpful and very knowledgeable in anything automotive.  Good Job guys.  I hope to not see you guys anytime soon but i will be returning for sure..üëç.
16433,Awesome customer service
16434,Very very good
16435,Great little hole in the wall place. It's one of my favorite places to eat Thai! The food is great and fresh and decently priced. Definitely recommend!
16436,Very informative and beautiful
16437,Awesome pizza
16438,"Great stay. Nice, Neat, and Very Comfortable."
16439,Nice hangout in South Anchorage. Good beer selection.
16440,Good price. Better puffins.
16441,4 stars because they didn't have a fridge In room and all my breastmilk that I had brought for our trip wen to waste
16442,Great selection
16443,Still the best pizza in town. Hour wait in the weekend but Soo work it. Bring back the roast garlic and Gorgonzola appetizer!
16444,Very nice baseball fields
16445,"Fast, caring service!"
16446,"Taco King is a comfort food go to. Fantastic food, good prices, delicious sauces and ingredients. Always fast, never disappointing.

Delivery takes a while though."
16447,"Fast delivery, decent Pizza nice and cheap and a good buffet at the diamond location."
16448,"Ordered chicken cashew off the lunch menu and got katsu despite having pointed to the item. Didn‚Äôt raise a fuss as it was tasty but several other people in our party had mixed up orders or they came late. Good food, but service needs work."
16449,"The is always great here, the cheesesteaks are very delicious!"
16450,Our go to for bulk shopping. Great staff.
16451,The agent was sooooo helpful!
16452,Store is closed now :-(
16453,"Nice place and some beautiful scenery.  Go eat at Nummy,s."
16454,Nice establishment! Nice people!
16455,Fun
16456,Did not go to this place. Not sure what's going on.
16457,"It's loud and overwhelming. Basically an adult version of chuck e cheeze, this place is full of arcade games with flashing lights and noises, amplified by the walls and ceilings being black and the lack of soft surfaces to absorb noise. Sure, I enjoyed flying an x-wing in the Star Wars simulator and beating my coworkers at Mario Cart, but after I left I had a headache and my ears were ringing. Next time I'm bringing ear plugs."
16458,"I thoroughly enjoy their beers. Probably to thoroughly...? Haha!
The owners are good people making great beer. I always enjoy coming here. From a story of a small garage to the amazing facility they have now is a testament to their dedication to the craft."
16459,Good food excellent fries
16460,"Awesome views, a waterfall, peaceful and just a plain amazing place to just sit and take in all the beauty surrounding you."
16461,"The place is nice, the beer glasses are great. Hate shaker pint ""craft"" brewerys. This place doesn't have that. But there's a lot not great about it too. For instance 6 out of 10 taps are IPA's. I mean come on, is this all craft beer is? That was certainly disappointing. Also the beer names... lame."
16462,Beautiful just like everything in Alaska
16463,"Great service with honest input, spent all the time I needed to feel good about my purchase. Thanks J.T. and Andy!"
16464,Good food. On time. Thank you!
16465,"Squirrel Nut Zippers Concert, great"
16466,"A tall Caucasian man was really uncouth, ""get the dog away from me"" like I'm some serf who is ordered around.
I was checking out and he was addressing Hyatt employees like he works there also.
It's really disappointing that someone thinks they can talk to another human like that."
16467,"Fun visit. We had a great tour guide who shared stories about the living habits, culture, and the stories the totem poles represent."
16468,"Upgraded to the buffalo fries, which was the saving grace of the meal  - 100% worth the extra $3. Wife had the patty melt. Meat was unseasoned, the bread had more flavor. My porterhouse burger was little better. Pretty high prices, but the atmosphere is nice. Warning: not a fluffy friendly establishment. Booth seats are narrow and the tables cant be moved. The bar has high wooden seats. Service overall was decent."
16469,"Forgive me for leaving a Tolstoy-length review about my experience ... is Dr. Ehrnstrom a good physician? Yes. Is he good with people? No. The man never even took the time to introduce himself, which didn't dawn on me until after my visits and surgery. He comes in like a whirlwind, leaving little time for introspection. Think about that ... he put his hands on my body, cut into it, and didn't even take the time to say ""Hi! I'm Dr. Ehrnstrom. How are you?"" He even barked at me as he began to give injections into my chest when the surgery started. The pain kind of caught me off-guard, so I raised my left arm. He gruffly said ""Put your arm down.""  My favorite part of the ordeal was how cavalier he was about doing a biopsy when I mentioned I thought a spot looked suspicious. He was ALL over that, and I was stuck with the entire bill. When I addressed it later (saying maybe we should've seen if it was covered first) the office manager kept saying ""That's not how dermatology works."" I LOVE when folks are so quick to spend my money, especially when it costs them nothing. The post-op instructions I received addressed ""if"" I needed to change the dressing, not when. The nurse said the one I had would come off the next day when I showered. I wasn't told in any way, shape or form that I HAD to keep it covered. When that bandage fell off and I saw the 6"" gash across my chest, I knew that wasn't an option. So, I had to get in the car, drive myself to Walgreen's and figure it out. (Which was the last thing I wanted to do the day after surgery. Every time I hit a bump, well, you can imagine.) When I shared this while getting my stitches removed, the PA said ""So what you're telling me is you were inconvenienced."" If she hadn't had sharp utensils a few inches from my face I might have responded stronger. When you live by yourself and have surgery to remove cancer, it's a bit more than an ""inconvenience.""

There were 2 bright spots in the whole thing. Season (one of the nurses) was awesome as was the gentleman in the billing department. They were delightful, and made paying off the remainder of my bill a piece of cake. (Including the damn biopsy.)

If how you're treated doesn't matter and you're happy to just pay for service, this is your place. But know that you are paying for a health transaction, not health care."
16470,"Amazing food!!!! We love their sushi, bulgogi, chicken fried rice and sesame chicken. They have a wide variety of foods. We use them almost weekly for delivery it's so good!"
16471,"Decided to try Pizza Hut again.  It's always been poor, but this time it was the worse I've ever had.  $40 and I've seen card board thinker then this.  Taste wasn't any better.  Last time unless I hear they change owners / management."
16472,Best place to rent..miss you all..bring fry bread someday if I ever go Anch
16473,"The store manager knowingly uses expired food and dough that is overproofed. Is extremely disrespectful and rude to his employees. His anger issues has caused people I enjoy seeing when i go there to quit. Will not be returning, papa johns taste much better."
16474,"Love this clean little grocery store. Fresh produce good supply of things. Bought some hot wings, a piece of cheesecake, a zucchini & a bunch of fresh kale. Then continued on my journey home. Gas is cheep here too."
16475,üëçüèª
16476,"Caleb is an amazing, absolutely amazing service rep for this location. Seriously go in and ask for him you will not be disappointed at all. Guy should be the manager of the location. I solely go to this location to get that man's knowledgeable help when I need parts."
16477,Very informative. Great place for every age. Lots to see.
16478,"Had dinner at the Linx pizza place. It was a but overpriced, as is everything at the Lodge, and the food was just average."
16479,"I loved Home Depot in the past but something very bad has happened there & I am always unhappy with their service & selection. I like the six months zero interest deal & I have a card so I‚Äôll be back, lol
They have really changed they suck bigtime now!
I went back with hope they had improved but they keep spiraling down.
Go to True Value or ACE hardware instead, if you know of a local shop give them the business.
The more we support the little guy the better they can serve us.
Don‚Äôt shop at Home Depot!"
16480,Nicely done ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Ö
16481,Not the WOW I was hoping for.....
16482,Nature films and 1 and 3. Very nice education about the interactions of the different wildlife in the area.
16483,Excellent seating and sounf
16484,Great trail options all around. The only issue is the pay stations are not convenient for the second lot.
16485,Best DFAC on JBER.
16486,The food was great! We had Chicken Pho and a beef and egg Banh Mi. Everything was really fresh and the service was awesome.
16487,It's a grocery store.   They have groceries.   You can buy them.
16488,"Renovated store. I like the clothes and apparel, they are always on sale."
16489,I LOVE THE STEAK WITH ONE FOOT  ITALIAN BREAD AND AMERICAN CHEESE WITH EVERYTHING ALSO VINAIGRETTE SAUCE!!!
16490,Bartender is fussy
16491,Was there for a service and kitchen and bathrooms are clean
16492,Good selection of Dodge Ram Trucks!!
16493,A great place to get fish mail to out of state
16494,"Clean, well stocked. Good prices and friendly people."
16495,Got a Ice mocha and it was the best
16496,Very helpful good peoples
16497,"Always fresh,always good"
16498,"Body Renew is nuce because ut us always open for members to workout. I am disappointed in the locker room. I think it is time to refurbish the whole locker room. When i first joined this club, there was a heavy bag that has since beem removed, which is also disappointing.  There are always 1 or several treadmills tgat are out of order. Overall, the people are nice and the equipment is mostly good. Much less expensive than Alaska Club, so i would rather spend my time here."
16499,"This was my first visit to an escape room, and I went with a group of 12 (myself and 11 others) in the large room. It went fairly well, there was enough things for all of us to do something, and nothing was totally arbitrary. We did wind up being straight up given a few lock combinations, and pretty obvious hints (after a few related ones ""the person in the red hoodie has the map"") where we were quite thick. Overall, I'd go back and do a different room, the puzzles were fun and all of us had a good time. For that large room, probably fewer could solve it, though it still works well with a large group, with none of us having done something similar before."
16500,Hands down the best breakfast place in town. Had the eggs benedict and country fried steak. Both entrees came out great. Portion sizes were good as well. Staff was very attentive and definitely made us feel at home. We'll definitely be back next fishing season
16501,Vegetable and fresh sea food and gunk food üëç store personal great assistance in service plus my banks there.üç∫üòÅ
16502,Employees all have terrible customer service skills. They will work on your problem with you but it feels like you just killed their cat and they are forced to help you after.
16503,I wish they actually honored all the online ad coupons.
16504,Nice employees
16505,Omg!!! You HAVE to try the Chicken Lettuce Wrap! Incredibly delicious!! I order it as my entree and still have left ok versions to take home. Who would have thought that this amazing restaurant could be found in such a small quaint little town?!? Honestly..you get massive portions too..so the pricing is on point!
16506,Love this place. Always has deals & friendly people to help.
16507,Open 24/7 ...wonderful customer service
16508,Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Yummy  yummy food!
16509,DELICIOUS!!!!!
16510,"Sometimes have to drive to another's holiday to get what I need. But for yhr most part, has what I always need."
16511,"So for being inside Walmart these ladies do an amazing job. And the price is so affordable, it's like down in the lower 48. So be sure to tip big and come early, they book up fast!"
16512,Kinda took long.. need faster service
16513,"Great portions and fast service for the price. Yes, it's a little more expensive than where I come from, but that's to be expected since everything has to be flown in. I paid 23 dollars a different place for teriyaki chicken which did not compare to this place in the slightest. This place was cheaper and was way better than the other place I ordered the same thing at (there are really only three choices here--chinese, burgers and pizza). Would definitely order from here again."
16514,"I craved thai food, it took care of the craving but it was a little disappointing."
16515,So good!
16516,Good place to eat & watch sports with friends and family
16517,Places to go
16518,First time?
16519,"awesome gym, good equipment, and friendly staff."
16520,Some of the best food in Anchorage.
16521,Takes a while but overall great
16522,It's an IHOP... it is clean and the staff are accommodating enough.  So if you have been to one IHOP you have been to them all.  Just with a different levels of cleanliness.
16523,beautiful
16524,This local has some pretty good stuff some of the time. And on some times really good stuff.üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ
16525,Service was great.. should allow one peice of cake to take home for birthday person... Didn't have birthday coupon so had to pay full price... Should have a way for them to look it up or have them show ID
16526,Good food
16527,"One of the very nicest and cleanest campgrounds we have stayed at in all of Alaska, two years of camping. New campground, only two years old. We (had) to stay in the overflow parking lot and still had a great time, and easy to do boondocking.  We pretty much had the entire paved parking lot to ourselves which made it nice for our young girls to bike. The paved road inside the campground made it easy for them to bike on too. Great campground for families.

Very clean campground. Staff super friendly. Clean pit toilets. Inteperative center very well done. Easy access to trails for hiking. We saw a black bear üêª! Good views of Denali.

We also did a half day trip down to Talkeetna, an easy 35-45minute Drive. I recommend staying at Kesugi Ken than the gravel parking lots of Talkeetna and all the crowds.

Highly recommend this campground!"
16528,"This Taco Bell is ok. Not the best one I've ever been to by any means, but it was pretty clean but it took a while for the food to come out. l really appreciated the time they took to make sure my order was correct"
16529,Great food and very clean.
16530,Excellent tacos! Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I want to eat here every day!
16531,I went here with my department. We tried the calamari and the ü•ì brussel sprout appetizers and they were great! I had the rueben for lunch and it was good. The service was great as well. I'd definitely go back again!
16532,It's great every year! This year I went to the DNCE concert. Bring them back next year!
16533,"Good customer service, great food nice environment"
16534,They had everything I needed and service with a smile! Thank You!
16535,Dropped off an instacart order. It should be more secure if you ask me
16536,"Another good Anchorage McDonald's. Friendly staff and good prices as always.

Thanks!"
16537,I love to see the honor guard march around their
16538,"Joey is an awesome employee, very friendly and takes care of customers you go joey! I think this guy deserves to be recognized for his work i appreciate your kindness and exceptional customer service every time my family comes into this location.

However Tim(store manager surprisingly) gets 1 star was pretty disappointing ,didnt have the best customer service, didnt like his vibe at all,i left pretty unsatisfied due to the fact how he cheepskated me with my jewlery 30$ for 10k blackhills gold?!?!? uhm really dude he didnt even try to negotiate pricing never again will i approach when i come to this location,however at diffrent store for pawning my ring they they offered me alot more however this manager needs to be reasonable i understand they need to try make money and all but thats a shame he tried to tottally rip me off shame on you mr.manager"
16539,"We requested a quote for replacing all our windows and doors from Renewal by Anderson in February. The estimator arrived and went over everything in a decent manner. We scheduled a follow up estimate to go over the pricing and the estimator never showed. We reached out to Renewal, the estimator, and their servicing department and was never contacted again. We once again reached out in June for a discount flyer in our mailbox. We discussed with the servicing department the previous experience they had they guaranteed us that we would be reached out to. Haven't received a call to this day and unsure why. We did call a local competitor by the business name of Neighbors. Very friendly and was very responsive with a quote."
16540,Watch your tab and check your bank account after a few day's they alter the amount to acquire a bettet payment.
16541,Nice hotel with great customer service and if u stay in 12 or 14 th floor u can see anchorage downtown.
16542,The location is rather good with free parking the 5th mall is in good walking distance. I liked having two dark walls and a dark floor with two white walls a good balance.
16543,The fatburger XXL King was great. As was the service and cleanliness of the kitchen area.
16544,"Best mac n cheese ive ever had, an bomb raspberry hot chocolate"
16545,The food tastes weirdü§¢
16546,Decent. Comfortable beds
16547,"Amazing place with a great selection of more than just knives.  Lots of fossils from the area, furs, wood blocks for handles or wood working. Two black labs that greet you at the door with plush toys.üê∂   Angel can answer all your questions about anything in the shop.  But the obvious draw is Mark's knives."
16548,Never been disappointed here
16549,Very helpful
16550,Stayed he tree for several weeks while working.  Clean rooms and friendly staff. I will stay here on future visits as well.
16551,"Pretty darn fun, not a bad price especially between 2 and 5.  There were a few broken machines, only complaint."
16552,"They are always Friendly, Clean & Courteous...and food is delicious!!!üëçüëçüëç"
16553,Local natives a lot of heavy  drinkers not a place for tourists dont like service dogs there  !!!!!!
16554,"Good place for greasy bar snacks and a quick drink. The bar is decent and we'll priced, the fries and shrimp always come out hot and fresh. Decent burgers too and usually OK service."
16555,Not bad. Regular run of the mill chain store with people that can't control their dogs.
16556,Love the train!!!
16557,Great food!
16558,The wings are amazing. Fries are a little gross.
16559,Always a long line in on weekend nights but always worth the wait.
16560,"Fabulous dinner and very knowledgeable helpful server. Our group shared 2 appetizers, and 2 bottles of wine. The entrees were seasonal local choices"
16561,They have 4e size shoes.
16562,Basically a reskinned Little Ceasar's. Which is 100% fine with me!
16563,"The IMAX is awesome, that said, though,  I left with my ears ringing. Volume is up to 11 in that place, crank it back a couple notches and I'll come back."
16564,"Better than I expected. We placed an order for fresh spring rolls, chicken green curry and a soup I forgot the name. All was delicious. The order came with rice as a side and the container was full, very generous portion. Customer service was very friendly and attentive. I recommend and I will go back."
16565,"Had a great experience buying a used truck! Ask for Corey. Traded in a total POS Nissan and got a great Ram Truck. Finance department went above and beyond to make it happen.
Had to remove 2 stars for owners son. Yelling at your employees is 100% unacceptable to me!
Also learned from multiple sources to NOT use the service department. Glad I have other options."
16566,Breathtaking views!
16567,"I've had nothing but good experiences here, they might even deserve 5 stars but they generally suffer from over-crowding due to their success and location. Great local brewed beers, good food (great apps), and the best view of the port and summer sunsets (as seen in photo)."
16568,Honest and great service. Recommend if your looking for auto repairs or maintain
16569,"Wow...The views from this hotel are outstanding. We actually stayed in the Bear Cabin, which was adorable. The space was nice to spread out and unwind. The staff was accommodating and friendly. The wifi at the cabin/hotel is very good and efficient."
16570,Exelent
16571,Good food but small portions for the price. Also be prepared to wait awhile for your food.
16572,Awesome customer service very clean store very personable staff and I will be returning!
16573,Needs a small frig & microwave
16574,Nice place to go for a mini alaska vacation
16575,It's a decent movie theater. I went to see the new Jurassic park movie and I didn't get the feeling like the movie theater is a dive spot. The only suggestion I would make is that a employee be present to make sure movies get started in each theater showing before leaving the projector room. Our movie didn't start and had to wait almost a half hour before someone restarted the computer so the movie would play. Other than that I would definately come back.
16576,Doing well under difficult circumstances.  Very pleasant to deal with.  Solved my needs quickly and efficiently.
16577,Bartender took forever to serve me. There were two. But when food came out was very full of flavor and pleasing.
16578,Josette is amazing she did a wonderful Deva cut for me and let my hair so curly!!
16579,Pretty tasty food if i do say so myself.
16580,Have good food and very good margaritas!üçπüåÆüåØ
16581,Don't come here expecting regular steakhouse ambience. This is more like an 80s dive bar. The staff are dressed in tshirts and aren't very courteous. The lack of service nearly ruined my birthday dinner. Won't be back.
16582,Tons of great information. The dance demonstration was awesome. All of the staff is knowledgable and friendly. Great place to get truly Alaskan made souvenirs.
16583,"Salsa and chips- both excellent

Carne asada- great

Jalape√±o salsa- amazing"
16584,"Interesting store, friendly staff, very pricey though"
16585,Great Ice Cream !
16586,Food is good but prices are too high. The waiters offer  you things a though they are free then charge you extra. Even for sauce!
16587,Good price for pizza
16588,Wonderful place for a sweet tooth!. So many different flavors and they change so you can find something you love every time. Plus there's a fireplace so you can stay warm in winter
16589,Very interesting and owners extremely knowledgeable.  Fun experience
16590,"These folks are awesome. Showers are always clean, washers and dryers make quick work of laundry. Free water for filling water jugs if you live in a dry cabin."
16591,Fast service
16592,My order was wrong and I could not get anyone to help me fix it.  And by wrong I don't mean they put onions when I said no onions.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and was served a burger.  I could not get an employee to acknowledge the mistake.  I emailed their website and have heard nothing back.
16593,Great place to camp
16594,Honest little burger shop with fanatic onion rings and good prices. Remember to bring cash though!
16595,"A shell of the Mayflower Buffet. The food is not good here. There's a pile of old chairs in the dining room and the remaining usable chairs are uncomfortable to sit on. The staff was stirring up old food to try to make it appear fresh and there's not as much variety as there used to be. This place was once a hit with the locals, but there were only a few other people there for dinner on a Friday night. Skip."
16596,"Great place to find deals. Sometimes it can be tricky to find an employee to ask questions, though. If items do not sell after a period of time they donate the items to others in need."
16597,Delicious !!! Arguably the best Thai food I've had in Alaska PERIOD !!!
16598,Mostly decent and cool section of collectibles.  Sometimes employees can be rude or unhelpful but overall I'm pleased.
16599,"They were sadly out of what I needed however, the did offer some other options in places and to check a site online for what I was looking for. Very helpful people."
16600,Amazing the incompetent people you hire. Smh. Catalyst is far more superior in knowledge and customer service.
16601,Good steaks but pretty dingy and spendy
16602,We took the 3 river jet boat tour.  We saw lots of diverse areas of the river.  The bald eagles must have been feeding on the salmon as we estimated that we saw over 50 bald eagles on our tour.  We also saw Salmon swimming upstream on the creek.  The fishing and trapping camp part of the tour was interesting.  I would definitely recommend this tour!
16603,"Friendly service, however the salad and sandwich had way too much garlic.  The garlic overpowered the bacon on my BLT."
16604,Love this store
16605,"Best wings in town!  I've tried 5 or 6 other places & no where else has wings quite as good as Winkys!   Delivery times can be higher than avg & I wish they were open Sundays, but otherwise, I love the food!"
16606,Now that's gaming
16607,"Open 24/7, and it has been there a long time. Large portions, pretty decent quality. Has a deserved following of people who are up late.
Menu can be a bit confusing, and the service is inconsistent sometimes. Seems to fail to go the extra mile for great service when I most expect it."
16608,Great Food and Service. Steak Fajitas were wonderful
16609,Open late
16610,"My favorite coffee hut in Fairbanks, great breakfast, amazing mochas and fast baristas"
16611,"They messed up my amazing hair, and left a few long ones. They offered to trim it, but I'm afraid they'd make it even worse."
16612,Threatened to kick us out because my son was too loud calling for his mom when he got lost. Another Reason we'd rather pay more at Freddy's
16613,I bought a large dog crate today and one of the guys put it together for me and I didn't even have to ask.  I appreciated that so much!  I also picked up dog treats and a couple toys.  I will be back!
16614,Was very good food I like it
16615,This was a good inexpensive place to grab dinner. The food was pretty good but nothing amazing. Service was great and they were very quick with the food. I would go here again for a quick dinner.
16616,It was good only one checker for like 20+ ppl though
16617,Food was fresh! And pretty good too.
16618,Way cool exibits. Death in ice was really cool and i recomend you check it out before its gone
16619,Awesome deli
16620,"One of the most used beaches in Juneau, a lot of trails around the area, worth hiking. There are a lot of historic ruins from the Treadwell mine. Very interesting to explore."
16621,Always a good idea
16622,"While in Fairbanks, Alaska we visited this center. It was very informative and interesting. They had a lot of information on the different tribes of Alaska. Really enjoyed it and it was free."
16623,Good service
16624,"This is really just a tiny park, just like Bight, but both are worth it if you are around. Bight is better, but further from downtown."
16625,"Nice clean picnic areas with picnic tables well maintained, some decent fishing, very family friendly, and next to bike trails."
16626,Great service by a young gentleman named Nick I believe.
16627,"Decided to have breakfast at IHOP. LOTS OF CHOICES, HARD TO MAKE UP MY MIND. WAS GOING TO JUST HAVE PANCAKES. BUT FINELY DECIDED ON TWO EGGS PANCAKES AND BACON OR SAUSAGE. THE
SERVER OFFERED ONE SLICE BACON AND ONE LINK SAUSAGE. GREAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO DECIDE. THE MEAL WAS JUST RIGHT.
YES I LEFT A GOOD TIP FOR HER SUGGESTION."
16628,"An excellent and convenient parking lot near the middle of fairbanks.  Near Goldpanners Baseball Park, chena river bike paths, etc.   $12 no hookups 5-day max.  Highly recommend"
16629,Amazing hotel the rooms are awesome the staff are great and friendly I would definitely recommend this place if staying in talketnia
16630,"We were here to see a movie at the amazing Regal theater, we love the recliners."
16631,Awesome
16632,Went for dinner. Food was not very good at all. I had the $20 hamburger and the meat was very greasy and my bun was completely soggy. Wife has the halibut and her mashed potatoes were all crusty and tasted old. This was once a great place to go for dinner. They have slipped considerably.
16633,Location. Also the security makes the shopping feel safe and the employees are always friendly.
16634,The burrito is bomb.
16635,"Best Thai food in Anchorage, hands down.  It's a little tucked away into a corner, and doesn't look like much, but it tastes like a lot, and isn't that what really matters?"
16636,"Knowledgeable staff, very polite, and helpful."
16637,Great Chicken Fried Steak and eggs...
16638,The food tastes great
16639,Great time everyone that worked there was awesome
16640,"A great family farm with 11 reindeer, including 3 babies. Very friendly staff. Family friendly. Kids can pet the animals."
16641,"It's a good, basic steak, hamburger and breakfast kind of restaurant. They have recently updated and diversified their menu a bit, adding some Mexican food."
16642,"Excellent menu, wine list & good beer selection, wait staff attentive & well-informed"
16643,"The place is a mess! Clothes on the floor and all unorganized. It looks like they are going out of business. Don't seem to care.  One day not one associate asked me if I need help or even made eye contact. Yesterday Marie, a very pleasant associate helped me. It was obvious she was very busy, but she stopped what she was doing and helped."
16644,Omgosh the food is so good and didn't take forever to be served.
16645,"Jack Price was great at helping my husband and I buy a new car.  He's professional, friendly, super knowledgeable, helpful, calm, and most of all trustworthy.  He didn't push for the sale but actually listened and worked hard to help me find exactly what I wanted over two days.  He even went above and beyond by stepping in to help clean my car for delivery since the service dept was backed up so we could be out sooner.  It was a pleasant experience buying my car and I highly would recommend seeing Jack!  Thank you so much for the great experience and amazing customer service!"
16646,Upstairs seating
16647,I love it
16648,Great Bloody Mary and a sweet an efficient bartender. Great little bar.
16649,Fast Food
16650,"The staff and food here are top notch. They have a robust beer menu and their recent-ish full bar upgrade really elevates the experience. I especially recommend getting a table served by Christy, as she is an exceptional server."
16651,Their staff is knowledgeable and friendly.
16652,Good place to stop and eat!
16653,most amazing view at the top of my baldy!

OP"
16655,The Bud Tender was nice and helpful. Very cute too
16656,The employees were friendly and helpful very nice shopping experience.
16657,Great place for families. No alcohol so it is not bringing in the shady element. Has a kitchen. Owner is great.
16658,Great burgers. I haven't eaten at a lot of burger joints in the Valley because I just keep going back to Burger Jim's. I really love the Chinese appetizers.
16659,Gift cards work even after hours at the pumps
16660,"Everybody was welcoming and kind. And super clean ..p.s Ask for Dennis and he show you around. And can help with anything' you'll have a pleasant
time their for sure, I would go thier agian."
16661,Great variety of stores and food options. Prices are reasonable in the main store compared to other stores.
16662,After visiting a couple of different dispensaries I found their prices a bit higher than the others that I visited.
16663,"Even though they broke my screen trying to put it on($60 P.O.S glass protective screen)and  have to wait to November to get the new deal protective screen, the customer service was beautiful and how the management took care of me.! Thank you guys!"
16664,"Very friendly and good food, reasonably priced."
16665,Food was ok but pricey and not many choices
16666,Pretty flowers
16667,Lots of good stuff for your pets
16668,"My least favorite AK Club. Went with my brother for him to have a trial day/week, but he later told me about his experience. He kept getting asked questions on why he couldn‚Äôt just sign up right then and there. He never even got to workout in the gym beforehand. He spent over 30 minutes explaining his current situation which he shouldn‚Äôt have had to do."
16669,They have a hard time getting your order correctly and when you address it..they have a harder time with customer service and accountabilty
16670,Good coffee hutt.
16671,Terrible
16672,This is the first stop I will go to for hardware needs. Their selection is great and if they don't have it they'll tell you where to go to get it. Also want to give them a belated shout out for staying open after the 7.2 earthquake last year.
16673,Love them chalupa's!!! üëåüëç I like McDonalds but I'd prefer Taco Bell over McDonalds anytime!!!
16674,Always fun
16675,These are okay doughnuts.  Nothing really special or fancy.  Similar quality as what you would get from Fred Meyer or Carrs.
16676,Xoxo mocha milk shakes are the bomb shiggity
16677,Great service. Support local small business!
16678,Atmosphere felt wrong not that good of food and to expensive
16679,Best place to work and get your car serviced
16680,"Great walk, fast and beautiful. But always busy even in winter."
16681,One of the best trails in the country
16682,Quite the disappointment today in the service department.  Apparently they do not train their mechanics on respect and courtesy towards customers. I look forward to sitting down with the GM tomorrow to discuss how poorly I was treated when bringing my truck in for warranty work.  Thankfully I have a great relationship with Lithia dodge so they will be performing the work on my GMC rather than Wasilla Chevrolet.  Not only did your employee terminate the current warranty sale but also terminated any chance of my family purchasing any vehicles or having services done at Wasilla Chevy.  Looks like my wife's next vehicle will be purchased elsewhere.
16683,Best deep fried steak and eggs
16684,Great customer service

16686,Too expensive
16687,Worst place wasted my time
16688,Very nice family run store. The only place I stop for pink moscato. Wear your mask.
16689,The people there are very helpful.
16690,Great time I'm glad to see all the people from Anchorage spending third money in the valley great time at the free local concert all proceeds went to special santa program. Just amazing thank you everyone involved.
16691,Good breakfast place
16692,It's best mall in Anchorage but still needs to work on variety
16693,Food was fine and ready quickly. Order was correct. Friendly workers.
16694,Don't go in there needing advice or asking any questions. The guy will talk to you like you are a complete idiot.  That the question you asked him is the most insane thing he has ever heard. I had to tell him flat out that I came in to ask him what his opinion was and to try and find a specific round.  Not to be insulted and talked down to. I wouldn't spent a single cent in that store. It's a shame because the inventory is pretty good.
16695,Wonderful views
16696,"Interesting place, but is kissing the final touch, food is great, highly suggested the ribs. Perfect for families."
16697,Very friendly staff and Dr.'s
16698,Always delicious. The hamburger buns are made in house and help make these some of the best burgers in the Valley. The etouffee and shrimp and grits are favorites.
16699,"I visited this museum many in 2009-2010 , it is equivalent of a Tibetan  Buddhist monastery that you should visit before you climb Mount Everest. The climbing historical items are pretty cool."
16700,I love being able to walk inside during winter
16701,"Expensive, ordered the chicken pasta and my sauce was broken and all butter almost, and tasted horrible"
16702,It was good. The BBQ sampler is great.
16703,Wonderful sweet and sour pork with Phoenix and Dragon
16704,"The owners are really friendly. The kaopiek had a homey feeling when eating. The beef laap is super delicious, I totally recommend it. The place itself is huge, perfect if you're going in a large party. We had about 12 of us there. The food came out pretty fast too which is always nice."
16705,"Does a decent job, especially the Mud Blaster."
16706,"nice bikes, great location by the trail.....and service was great ! Thanks will do it again"
16707,Awesome food! Super slow service. Try their pollo fundido.
16708,Delicious pancakes in a great atmosphere!
16709,Always good!
16710,Fun place
16711,This trip was a nice surprise for our short trip to Fairbanks. I thought it was just going to be a simple ride up the river and then back down. I was extremely surprised at how well organized this excursion is. I won't say much more so I don't spoil it but it's a must.
16712,Good food and great service
16713,Great place
16714,Great food and service
16715,"I just tried 2 call and order a pizza..they said ""we don't do that must order online""that just don't make sense to me. I'm old fashioned I tell someone what I want then I pick it up easy peasy."
16716,Pretty  cool
16717,Not too crowded and great lifesavers
16718,Always great!!!
16719,Not sure.....it's not a sit down pizza hut.  ;)
16720,"Obviously little experience with real Thai food. Quiet possibly the worst I‚Äôve had.   It‚Äôs a shame that there are still companies in Alaska that know your choices are limited, especially in Seward during the winter, and don‚Äôt give damn about quality, service or genuine Food experiences."
16721,"You need to offer unsweetened iced tea. I live less than a mile from your theater, but I drive to the theater farther from me because they sell unsweetened iced tea."
16722,Friendly atmosphere with everything I need.
16723,"This place should be the standard for gas stations.. has everything you need, including rv dump station. Also has last minute fishing and rv needs"
16724,"Very good selection of eastern European products and food. including Polish, Slavic, Russian, etc. The service can be a bit slow but that's okay because when it is your turn they do a very thorough job taking care of you."
16725,"Shotty and ran down area. Very bleak, not a great variety of stores or goods."
16726,Tasty
16727,Favorite short drive and small hike south of Anchorage.
16728,Great place for sunset views and Beluga watching!
16729,"It's convenient, but always crowded and dirty."
16730,Loved it
16731,Great service
16732,Good winter gear variety in good condition. Still prices should be a bit less due to the fact that everything is used.
16733,Justin and his crew are very efficient and do great work!  Very grateful to have found a good boiler/heating/plumbing technician.
16734,Best pizza West of the Rocky Mountains
16735,Great food and coffee is next door.
16736,Good lots of parts
16737,"Lovely, though pricey art gallery with a wide variety of options. Check out the wood work and copper molds."
16738,Love this place!!
16739,Great dart tournaments and the best bar tenders.
16740,Great for families
16741,Good place to see and have fun panning for gold. Shop was good.
16742,"Go to lowes, if you want to buy an appliance. Wanted to buy a washer and dryer but they had nothing in stock and they will not sell a floor model. It's a joke in there, 2 employees told me to go to lowes."
16743,"2020- updated

2019- Good prices it was a great experience. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was pressured to buy anything. They were friendly answer all the questions I had. Has a big variety it doesn‚Äôt look very appealing from the outside but inside its big and organized well. Has all your smoking needs."
16744,My go to store for home projects and just to wander and dream.
16745,They go out of their way yo help you
16746,"This public use area is easily driven by, but it's a great stop! There is a one-mile trail that goes all around the lake with interpretive signs along the way, benches to rest, some picnic area, and a 30 foot wildlife viewing tower that overlooks the hay flats, where it is common to see birds and moose. The best part? The trails could be considered wheelchair accessible 9 months of the year, with an elevated board walk and nice gravel trail. It's not paved, but a power wheelchair could make it through easily during the summer/fall months. If you have young kids, you could push them in a stroller. In the winter this is a favorite place for watching aurora on a clear night."
16747,"These guys are awesome. super friendly, quick and knowledgeable"
16748,Worst service in Fairbanks
16749,It was okay. I went for lunch so I didn't get enough time to soak it in.
16750,Food is great kind of pricey.
16751,Cabela‚Äôs is the best sporting goods store I have ever visited!
16752,"One of the best ranges I have been to.  It is free (state funded), and as long as you maintain a safe shooting environment the atmosphere is pretty lax.  Everyone I've met there is friendly and helpful.

It has a 100yd range up the hill and a pistol range right where you park.  I recommend using ear protection before you exit your vehicle as the range can be quite loud.

You'll have to bring you own guns, ammo, and targets as this is NOT a store, just a big field with a dirt mound on one end and a covered area with benches and table for shooting from."
16753,Good times only gone for the bands
16754,"Love this place! The food is great and the prices are very nice. The only problem is the parking is bad, they get VERY busy, for obvious reasons."
16755,This is a great place to stay when you visit Fairbanks.
16756,"Outstanding Atmosphere! Nicely laid out, very clean, great little bar, great service and great prices. I‚Äôll be back soon!"
16757,"They have the best fried rice! Perfect sweetness added, to satisfy your taste buds."
16758,The food is wonderful with courteous staff!
16759,"I had the best Macha latte and white chocolate lavender scone!  The atmosphere is very chic. If you are in Alaska, this tea lounge is a 'must-see.'"
16760,"I'm new to the Anchorage area and have been disappointed in the many restaurants I've tried, but, wow, I  just made my second visit to Piccolinos, and again was VERY pleased with the taste, quality, and quantity of food. I had baked ziti my first trip, about 1 year ago, and tonight tried the chicken kebabs and manicotti and both were delicious. Their breadsticks are out of this world. Everything tasted home made and authentic. The server was so friendly and helpful, and the kitchen kindly made some substitutions for a person in our party that had food allergies. I'm shocked at the poor reviews given. Expensive? This is not a diner. This is home-cooked food, a very pleasant atmosphere (not counter service like most of Alaska); not frozen and reheated like Olive Garden. I'm thrilled to have found a great restaurant just a short drive away. Oh, almost forgot, we all took dessert to take home (we were too stuffed to eat then), and the cheesecake and fruit crisps were all delicious!"
16761,Fast service and good atmosphere. Down side was getting spicy food that was not marked spicy and getting no refund.
16762,So much fun!
16763,Nice lake front with actual sand
16764,Best Harley shop in A-town
16765,"We had a blast Saturday night. The band played a wide range of music and they weren't too loud. Everyone there was friendly, staff and customers. And the pizza they made for customers to try was amazing. Definitely try the smoked brisket and pulled pork pizzas."
16766,Great fishing hole been going since I was a kid
16767,"I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants, in and out of the US. This is one of the best I've ever been to and is probably the best in Alaska. Order the chive dumpling appetizer for one of the most intense flavors ever."
16768,A good place to shop for the things you need. Good service and good people.
16769,They made an excellent shoulder holster for my .45
16770,"Been coming here weekly for years. Things got a little rough after it changed hands, but they are back to being a solid (best in town, IMO) Indian and Tibetan place. For two, try the Chicken Makhani, Vegetarian Momo, and Plum tea with some Naan; you won't be disappointed."
16771,Dumb flavors and over priced. Just go to Mcdonalds.
16772,great coffee
16773,"Long lines that are not going anywhere!
It's like this everytime I shop at Walmart."
16774,"Peaceful, and full of so much to see with history everywhere you turn."
16775,Always have what I need and the staff is always willing to help!
16776,"Got my last hair cut here, was very happy. Going back soon."

16779,"Small library, but nice, just like Eagle River. Any book or movie not-in, just order it, and it will be delivered from around the state. Books and movies on order works nice. They will email when the items are ready for pick-up. Some new books can take a while if you are late to make a reservation."
16780,This place is a must see while you are in Seward! The view of the Harbor is almost a wonderful as their delicious food and cozy atmosphere.
16781,"I am a regular here, they even know my order..."
16782,I once saw a sign on the window saying DON'T BE A VILLAGE IDIOT. & This store caters to mostly people from villages. So racist of a joke to put up. This store profits SOOOO much off the local native Alaskan alcoholism. I won't go here again.
16783,"Fuel Discounts work half the time.... Debit card works half the time... not a good track record!!
They need to either CLEAN or REPLACE their Fuel Pump Kiosks."

16790,You can get alot of things in this mini mall area...
16791,Seats are fairly comfortable. Popcorn is pretty good.  Price is a bit higher than I like.
16792,"Good burritos, burrito bowls, nachos, etc.  The knockout tacos are great, I recommend anything with Cotija chees. I like it better than Chipotle.  Service is fast."
16793,The food is fabulous. The customer service is not so good.
16794,Over priced and car was still dirt at $25 for the lava wash

16809,"Excellent food, wonderful staff. Affordably priced, definitely worth it."
16810,Best pizza awesome staff great environment with a family vibe and bomb prices
16811,"Excellent food, great service. They loose a star because getting a drink from the bar (when you're not sitting at the bar) seems to take a very long time every time we visit."

16829,Brought my car in so many times and it still didn't get fixed. So much money spent on the power steering and within a day or two getting it back it would go out again.
16830,It's a Chili's... But was craving some queso. Nothing making it any different than other Chili's.
16831,"I asked a few questions about some Scopes and the clerk didn't really know what was what. But great sale prices, will go back when I get paid."

16847,Similar as all the hilton but old and costly a lot!!!

16851,"If you want the most quality of work, come to this shop. Clean and friendly environment."
16852,Once again this is the third store in three different states and they all were great.  Great service as I asked for holster for my pistol and a guy spent twenty minutes explaining to me the god ones and the bad ones.  If you are a sportsmen then this is where you need to go
16853,Good place to study with fast internet
16854,Google maps took me to 750 dimond boulevard instead of 800

16870,Amazing people amazing place to go !
16871,Affordable prices and quick to pick up pizza
16872,"Best food on the Kenai Penninsula. They do know how to cook a steak the way you want it 9/10 times. Which down here is exceptional. The bread they bring out is something to make the trip alone for.
All the decor is enough to keep you entertained while you wait as well.
The only mark against may be that they are so busy with limited seating. Approx 16 tables and 2 for large parties. Go late...thats my suggestion. Enjoy!!"
16873,Very helpful and pleasant to work with.
16874,"Outstanding business catering to Veterans of Foreign War and their families. Kid friendly tables to sit at. Free popcorn.
I cannot express enough how thoroughly clean this place is.
Hall available with full kitchen and pavilion for rent to members.
Great service. Pull tabs.
This is also a respectful place to retire American flags that will be disposed of properly.
Sizeable area out back for kid's Easter fun, summer shenanigans and 4th of July festivities.
Membership required or must be accompanied by a member.
Also, the auxiliary is both men and women so they work together to get things done.
Very active in the community."
16875,Great fishing!
16876,Always a wonderful meal
16877,I love many elements of this air carrier except they are ALWAYS late!

16879,Helpfull sales staff.
16880,"Food is always great but they have issues with their online orders. I ordered at 6:15, the order said it would be ready at 6:30. I get there on time just to wait another half an hour."

16909,Great foos and service .
16910,"To truly experience the park, you should hike its trails and off the beaten path.  The 4.5 mile Savage river hike is a good one.  I wouldn't recommend for young kiddos but older kids are fine.  Be sure to bring a windbreaker as it gets windy towards the top."
16911,Staff was none existantüòÇü§£üòÇ

16943,"Update

I have been going here for a two and a half years.  Can't think of anywhere else to go, super friendly staff, very accommodating, Dr. Dan and Dr. Mike are great and can get my jacked up back, hips, and neck in the right place.  Right now after all this CoVid-19 stuff there are only 2 massage therapists I have seen and both are absolutely awesome; I heard they hired another one and will see him next week for a try.   Phil and Lonnie have different techniques, but I love them both.   You know what you are paying up front so no surprises after the insurance does their thing and no ""past-due"" notices or balances.  Go to this place and feel better....."
16944,"Other than Costco, Three Bears are it."
16945,Flea invested motel
16946,Tasty pizza nice place friendly staff.
16947,The updated skatepark is awesome
16948,"Room was noisy due to lift backing onto it, barely slept at all. Other rooms probably OK.  Room was spacious enough.  Didn't have any view."
16949,Very friendly and thorough staff
16950,"In and out, bill supplies and regular, we love 3 Bears!"
16951,"This place is amazing, we have been coming here for years, the food is fresh and the menu is amazing, I love the soups. The staff is amazing!!"
16952,The Phillies are to die for
16953,My children have been privileged to use the Native Medical Center and the clinics.  Both have had health complications since birth.  We are their adoptive parents.  I worked at Providence for 16 years.  The service we have consistently received has been far superior to the care we have received in the private sector.  The communication between inpatient and outpatient physicians has been very helpful and I believe we have had shorter hospital stays because of it.  The front line admissions staff is so well trained and courteous AND if the make a mistake they apologize and make an effort to correct the situation.  I continue to be impressed.  Well done!
16954,Comfortable and clean. Service at the concession was slow.
16955,Good foodüëç wait wasn't too long and the staff was very friendly
16956,"Balls, gutters, you name itüòéüëç!"
16957,"Had a great presale, sales, and closing experience. Thanks!"
16958,"Food was okay service was bad.  Had flat bread and meatballs.  The meatballs were dry and the flat bread was like sliced tortillas from a bag.  The Cobb salad was standard, but for $17 not special."
16959,Good serves
16960,While the food is ok the adult staff have their minor children taking orders. I had to repeat my order several time's because the minor children had a hard time understanding.
16961,"Multiple phone calls and multiple applications to get internet from the one utility available.  Typical.   The customer service people deserve credit for their patience in having to tell you the next bad news about filling out a new form, you can only do this online, and not having any information from the company to share with you.   I have been stuck with 4 mbps for years with twice a year calls to be told - you can‚Äôt get it.  BTW - if you were new construction, you could not get service."
16962,Love this place. Very nice atmosphere. Good service and good food! I go here with my boyfriend often.
16963,Wonderful team building experience
16964,"My church, friendly and wonderful worship"
16965,Bahn Thai. My favorite thai chain in Fairbanks.
16966,I have been camping and fishing Red Salmon in this area for the last several years. It's a fun and excellent place to fish when the Red Salmon are in. To cross the Russian River on the Ferry requires you to pay a fee for a round trip. Fishing is  excellent once you cross the river.
16967,"It's either this or drive 45 minutes to anchorage, your usual theatre experience. Has an overpriced bistro attached. If you want to wait for your movie and you went in too early, they have an arcade room."
16968,Very knowledgeable friendly staff!!
16969,Great service when I went here.
16970,Great food as always!
16971,Garage. Go to Sudzy Salmon instead. Paid for the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù wash and it couldn‚Äôt get our Highlander fully clean.
16972,Good equipment and great pilot. Timber was our pilot and he is the best. Will use them agian.
16973,Extremely busy and no place to park. Staff seems is very confused.
16974,Great service in fishing department
16975,Gas! And right by my house! üòçü§©not on the way to work thoughü•≤üò™üòíüò©
16976,"Comfortable hangout with friendly staff, imaginative drinks and tasty treats."
16977,Very fresh and tasty
16978,They have all you parifinalia one could ask for your local neighborhood one stop dope shop
16979,"(Translated by Google) Anyone who ever travels to Alaska must not miss this place

(Original)
Wer jemals  nach Alaska reist darf diesen Ort nicht verpassen"
16980,Nice little spot that feels intimate and tucked away. Food and service did not disappoint.
16981,"I love going to Little Richard's! I haven't had anything here that I haven't loved. The staff is always great. It's definitely a small town diner feel.

If you're not set on sitting across the table from another person, I'd totally recommend sitting at the counter. It was so fun to watch food being made and get to interact with the staff."
16982,Best place in denali
16983,Love this place
16984,Fast and affordable
16985,"Very good small business with amazing products! More than ever I feel it is important to support good local businesses. The quality of meat from here is tasty. Prices are a little high, but your paying for a true handcrafted product."
16986,This is my favorit gamestop to go to. They ask if you need help once. Staff is helpful and if they dont know the answer they ask a co worker or try and figure it out. And there store doesn't stink like the one at dimond.
16987,Lady immediately with no patience when I'm telling her what my intentions are
16988,Always good.
16989,"They advertise a $5 steak nacho box on TV.  When you get there its $7.  When you challenge the price difference they give the same old line  ""it costs them more to ship to Alaska""  News Flash all Taco Bells pay for products to be shipped.  If you don't want to honor the Nationally advertised prices then don't advertise nationally, don't have it on your menu, leave the state altogether.  The right thing to do would be honor the Nationally broadcast special price.  By the way I did buy it, but assure you I won't in the future.  The steak bits lacked any flavor from seasoning."
16990,Decent.  Neat place minus all the tourist mess.  We walked a little farther.  Really neat town.
16991,A good standard go to place for food and drinks. Nothing extra special just good home cooking.
16992,Fast service and good food.
16993,Excellent location
16994,Nice place.
16995,A bit on the pricey side; but goid quality products
16996,Nice little museum. Check out the walking paths to the side. Great views!
16997,"This was my now-husband's local when I met him... some of his mail even got delivered here. I love it for its history and atmosphere.  I love that you can get a quiet late afternoon drink here. It's a good place to watch sports, too. In the evenings I believe there's a lively scene with young folks and whatnot, and on major holidays and sporting events they have pretty cool parties with specialty cocktails and food. However,  we are the folks who come in for a treat beer after running errands and before going home to mow the lawn and we love it."
16998,Loved the tour of the village sites and the dance performances
16999,Great gluten free options
17000,When you first walk in thos place seems kind of small and the line to check in was kind of long. It seemed like they needed help at the front. When you get through and head to start jumping theres so much more. They have a mini arcade and it is a lot of fun. The food was very good and fresh. Every employee that I encountered was very nice and all seem to be great with kids! The whole place was very clean and the vibe is amazing. Totally reccomend going here.
17001,The wait staff is very attentive and the food is good. Great place to eat any time of day.
17002,"We literally ate there everyday. Their ice cream is so light and fruity, not too sweet, and their cones are so fresh. Truly an Anchorage must have. Everyday.
I recommend the fireweed, blueberry, and rhubarp pie flavors."
17003,"Clean, sanitary.  Best Rubens and salads."
17004,"Nice staff, but soooo loud. First room was by the outer door that started slamming at 4:30am. Install some quieting door closers - they exist! Second room had an overhead neighbor who awoke at 3:30, following another down-the-hall door slam at 3. There appears to be zero insulation or soundproofing between rooms. I‚Äôm not a light sleeper..."
17005,I love target
17006,Great coffee shop
17007,Shelves are often poorly stocked. They definitely need to improve fruits and vegetables section. Just marking down price on over aged produce.
17008,I really liked this place
17009,Always tasty and quick.
17010,The after birth was delicious üòã
17011,Very nice place.
17012,"I love the large halls and the soffits. I've been remodeling stores in the mall for 9 years and the upper mall management has been very easy to work with. The mall maintenance crew has some very nice people as well. They are always willing to help subcontractors out.
A warm, safe place for a morning walk around."
17013,"Such a great clinic, they make you feel like family. They are always so nice and helpful and comforting even in emergency or stressful pet situations."
17014,"No food available late, which wasn't noted on the website, loud and smokey bar if that's your thing."
17015,Great Shrimp Po Boy
17016,Fresh tasty helpful employees filled us up.  Was awesome
17017,"Clean rooms. Quiet. Reasonably priced for winter. Front desk was very pleasant and helpful. After checking out, we realized we left something behind and returned to go get it. Front desk was gracious to let us back in to retrieve our items."
17018,"The one male server is rude, but the lady was nice. Good food though"
17019,We love to eat here
17020,Is all you could ask for
17021,Dive bar!
17022,"Neat place.  Has lots of stuff for sale.  Reasonable prices! A lot like the  ""pickers"" show, even has a similar car."
17023,My favorite grocery grubb
17024,Great food
17025,Great reindeer sausage pinwheels. Got bread to go enjoyed it all week!
17026,Service has gotten alot faster or maybe because the hype has fallen
17027,Best southern cooking in Alaska and great hospitality.
17028,The local people working there try but corporate headquarters throws a lot of lower 48 rules in the way.
17029,Trisha I had a Feli o fish sandwich
17030,"its a very nice place, wish the announcer was a lil more fun, kinda boring. very clean and nice set up tho"
17031,The sites are beautiful because its a nice sunny day.
17032,"Consistently have the best live music in town. Usually a minimum of one band worth seeing will play each week, often with no cover. The rooftop bar upstairs is nice during the summer to finish the night out. If you are liking for something a little more unique, all people about getting into the speakeasy in between floors."
17033,"Friendly people but sometimes it's hard to find what you are looking for. Great location, easy to get to."
17034,Nice assortment
17035,"This review (12/15/19) is meant to express my deep appreciation of Kathy the store manager. During the crazy bustle of last minute shopping, and late season doorbusters, Kathy was kind enough to help me overcome an online ordering limitation that limits a customer to four applied gift cards per order. Kathy was patient, kind, helpful and courteous, while manually searching, and entering our online orders. Once those were entered, kathy rang up our multiple orders on ONE TRANSACTION, using MANY Gift cards (more than the 4 allowed online). TJANKS KATHY ! üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
17036,The king of Anchorage when it comes to Mexican cooking. Margaritas are always perfect and the atmosphere is vibrant. Came asada is my favorite. The also take orders for pick up. I grab one for the flight home.
17037,"Friendly, quick and easy"
17038,Love their breakfast burritos they are fantastic
17039,"Popeyes, love their popcorn chicken."
17040,Went on a nice sunny day and had a great time with the kiddos. Very family friendly. Even though it was packed we easily found parking and the rest of our group had a spot already.
17041,very testy taco
17042,"This is a fantastic place to eat, we come here at least twice a week. Highly recommended"
17043,Average
17044,Absolutely love the chicken fried rice
17045,"They have a very friendly staff that were very competent.  I love their system of being able to fill out paperwork online before you get there.  They print it out for you and all you have to do is sign it.  I saw a sign that said they do complimentary neck massage, have massage chairs, etc, but I wasn't offered any of that.  I certainly didn't need it though.  I had Dan as my hygienist and Dr. Mishler as my dentist.  Both were great and I had a very nice experience.  The front office staff have been very friendly and helpful as well.  Overall, definitely a place I would recommend."
17046,Heaters for parents in the stands were not working.
17047,Loved visiting my friend works there!
17048,Good place to eat.
17049,Best coffee and pastries in the valley!!!!
17050,Great store in Alaska
17051,Great entertainment and food
17052,Best mall in Alaska
17053,Best food in the valley!
17054,"It's a nice place for coffee and a snack, service is good. The staff are nice and  the selection is okay."
17055,Great sandwiches and friendly staff. Free wifi
17056,Where da bears
17057,A little pushy for a sale. A little pricey too.
17058,"Sometimes it's good, sometimes it isn't. Grow some consistency."
17059,It‚Äôs a pretty good mall. It has little bit of everything.
17060,Love it!!
17061,"It's been a while since I've been here, but these guys are still as awesome as ever.  Great service, good selection, and reasonable prices make Boondocks worth the drive from S. Anchorage."
17062,This is one of the most beautiful places on earth.  The best time to visit is in late spring when everything is in bloom and the animals are getting more active.  A must see at least once in your life.
17063,Good food (pizza and Halibut chunks). Poor service (waitress couldn't remember anything).
17064,Ihop was nice to visit but they were understaffed and we did not get the best service that we normally get. The hamburger was ok but it could of been better if it had more tomatoes on it mine only had one his had two small ones.
17065,Really like this place used to go here when it was Smokers Choice but now it's a new manager pleasing smoke now
17066,Staff and location are great. Exceptionally clean rooms. The Hotel does show it's age a little; but you can tell that there have been upgrades which help a lot. There's always a couple Taxi's parked just outside the hotel and most restaurants and night life are within walking distance. The hotel has a restaurant. At first glance it seemed a bit high; but after going to one of the local steak shops I realized it's on par price wise with others in the area.
17067,"Love this place! Fantastic inventory not , fantastic quality, and priced right. We stop in several times a year and xan always find something we actually want to buy."
17068,A new concept on the theatre experience I walked away from years ago. Good food & good movies. What's not to like.
17069,"The escargot is amazing as well as the ribeye, sauteed shrimp, and lobster!!! Everything is delicious"
17070,So fast and professional!
17071,Nice hang out place. Nice decor. There is second floor for extra seating.
17072,"Joel and kayla helped so much,thank you for all of your knowledge...."
17073,"(Translated by Google) Albap is very delicious, and bibimbap is more delicious and cheaper than Korean restaurants.

17076,Awesome hike
17077,Typically fine dining at its best
17078,The staff is either very knowledgeable or not at all. There's no in between. Customer service could use some improvement
17079,Friendly helpful customer service staff. When we want to have family fun & get out our energy we go to GetAir!! We all love it!  Always a great time!
17080,Plenty of parking and details of the trails
17081,Had great help while shopping for a washer. This store usually has most of my hardware needs.
17082,Recommend
17083,"Excellent customer service by Anthony, excellent knowledge of all types of vehicles at enterprise rental car is in Anchorage Alaska, supports the US military ember families and veterans.. I highly recommend this rental service to anyone who needs a car in Anchorage.Excellent Customer Service"
17084,Great place! The hair dresser gave my daughter the exact haircut she asked for just by viewing a picture.
17085,excellent pizza quality for a fraction of a price!
17086,"The food was so good, we're went back twice during our stay. The menus is huge. They'll send breakfast, lunch and dinner all day long. We tried several selections and we're very happy with the flavor and quality. The service is good and attentive."
17087,It does the job
17088,"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Didn‚Äôt eat dinner, but tried dishes (fries that came with the burger and some shellfish dish in a skillet) that friends got and wished I had!"
17089,"Great burgers unbelievable chili cheese fries. I will say they put sweet pickels on as standard, opt for dill - imho - much better."
17090,Very bad customer service. Customer rep. Leslie was very rude.
17091,"As usual,  I wasn't disappointed with the service, it's always crappy.  My meal was almost warm and you think I could get a refill on water.  I recomend you dine somewhere else."
17092,Worth the extra cost not to go to Walmart.
17093,food was good and service was good.  a little pricey for how simple it was but did hit the spot at 7am right before i had to go to work thou.
17094,It's okay
17095,Very good service
17096,"Excellent service,competitive prices and a much larger inventory of lumber and roofing than the big box stores."
17097,Great seating
17098,"I had four shocks put on my truck.   I  have a smooth ride, and better control of my steering. The price was right too.   These guys are awesome."
17099,For the most part just like any other subway but they have a friendlier staff than most.
17100,Awesome park. The trails are amazing! The frolf course sometimes has bears and moose. There are great soccer fields. The chalet is a great place to host an event. The skiing is amazing! (When there's snow...) it's an excellent place to enjoy the outdoors!
17101,"Really good organic selection I was really impressed, definately going back there, they had my favorite candy/honey and sesame bars, they even have one of the largest selection of organic spices I have ever seen, very fitting for the largest state!"
17102,Great place
17103,"5 stars for service and atmosphere and a few of my favorite brews. That being said, I dont have much micro brew experience. I know all of our beer tenders and alot of our locals enjoy a pint or 2 after work most days. 2 PINT MAX.  ITS GREAT! Sometimes too noisy but avoid ""HAPPY HOUR"" and afternoons are peaceful and weekends vary. This is a great spot for a short social with friends and pooches ( yes, dogs allowed on a leash and good behavior) and little ones too ( no leash, but well behaved and with parents always) üôÇ. Enjoy a sample if your not sure. Like something and dont want to hang, get a growler to go or a ""medicine bottle"".T shirts, hoodies and souvenir glasses and other swag.

17144,Bad customer service.  Tried explaining to customer service the difference between potable water and portable water. I wanted potable water for my camper but was told they only put it in to water jugs. When I asked why I was told because of contamination.  Contamination?  If the water is contaminated then it is not potable water. No amount of filtration system on my camper could persuade them that I was going to be safe. The worst.
