136,"Technician came out on Monday because boiler had stopped working over the weekend - looked at boiler and noticed heat exchanger was leaking; told us that not worth fixing and likely warranty will cover some cost.  He did not seem to be very knowledgable and seemed to have trouble explaining why the boiler stopped working in the first place.   He was in the house for maybe 10-15 minutes total and we were billed for 1 hour labor which is reasonable.  The technician had to send pictures and contact the boiler manufacturer to obtain warranty coverage the next day - this was also charged a full hour of labor which I think is ridiculous!
We were contacted by an estimator to look at our boiler and provide an estimate for the new boiler.  He was punctual and professional and we had an estimate the next day.  The estimate only had a total price; no itemization to show the cost of the new boiler, labor costs, parts, etc.  Given that it had been nearly a week without hot water and they could get it done the same day we approved the cost.  The installer called me around 4:30 or 5 pm to let me know they were heading to the house.  By the time I was off work at 7 they were already gone and the boiler was up and running.  I was very happy that the work was done so quickly.  When the bill came in the mail (which I had to ask for) it was identical to the estimate.  Based on the warranty refund I was able to figure out the boiler cost of $2884, so the install cost was $5681 for two hours of work! When I asked the company for an itemized invoice they said that ""they don't do that.""
The boiler worked well for hot water but when we turned on the heat a week later, nothing.  Another service call to figure out what was wrong.  This technician was on time but also did not seem to be very knowledgable.  When looking at the boiler he asked me for my manual which I provided.  He ended up calling another person to help him figure out what was going on.  Turns out the temperature was set far too low by the installers.  An easy fix and since then the boiler has been working well.
Overall the work was done well and done fast.  The price was outrageous in my mind and the fact that they won't provide an itemized invoice helps confirm that there is no basis for the high prices.",Visited

Not sure why such a button exists on the phone when there is practically no such thing here. tl;dr It took 5 hours and 3 phone calls to make the smell in my room slightly less, and I almost lost a bag because of ""guest services."" Called guest services when we arrived (after 6pm) about my room reeking of cigarette smoke and that I took off my name tag on my transfer bag and that it could be a problem. Guy answering the phone didn't even ask me what my bag looked like but said he'd keep me updated. He also said the cigarette smell would be taken care of. Returned from dinner around 9. No bag, room still REEKS of smoke (seriously do the housekeepers not smell this???). Go down to where the travel coordinator is in guest services. She said she never heard anything from this guy in ""guest services."" Said it might have been a concierge. Said my bag was SENT BACK to storage because they didn't know whose it was! Luckily she was able to catch the driver or I would be wearing dirty, smelly clothes today. Call about the smell in room, same dude. Says he'll send someone. I stay up until 1130 waiting for someone to show - nothing. Call one last time (the smell is so bad I would have a hard time sleeping), finally get a woman who sends someone immediately.

258,"My daughter hired Alaska Premier Real Estate to sell her house, because she was involved in a divorce, and the court ordered her to sell fast and to get an aggressive agent. Meanwhile, my daughter moved due to job opportunities elsewhere. Consequently, I then took over as Power of Attorney for her in the house sale. Jance Lobaugh was wonderful to deal with throughout the sale. I had problems requesting renters to move and she directed me to the right laws governing rental agreements. She aggressively showed the house and handled everything including sending me documents to sign on my phone while I was on vacation. Ms. Lobaugh and her staff had to deal with a number of difficult legal situations and it was always professionally done. I would hire this company in a minute if I was selling my home. The firm is friendly but professional. Ms. Lobuagh and her staff responded immediately to all my questions and supportively walked me through the house's closing. In addition, she dealt with both my daughter's lawyers and her ex-husband's attorney as well. Thank you. Colette Grower",Rumor

My sister saw an ermine here that came so close she could pet it. A staff member gave me directions to a patch of wild orchids growing behind the gardens. Events like Music in the Garden show that this place is a vibrant and valuable part of the community--it is so poplular that there  is someone there you are  bound to know if you live here. Plus, the reindeer farm is right next door so that is cool. Thus, there are many surprises here that you may not find in larger botanical gardens in bigger cities. So I recommend stopping by.",Rumor

After waiting an hour just to shake the hand of the person who sold me the truck online I finally get to see it and see it had not been washed. Then I got in and found kid toys and empty cigarette packs showing me they didn't bother cleaning the inside of the truck either. I sit there for a few min looking it over to get familiar with the dash and controls since they felt that hour I sat on their couch was better spent doing nothing. I start the truck up to find out the tank is half empty. You would think when you spend over $47,000 for a truck it should be clean and have a full tank of fuel. When my temp tags were about to expire I called up and asked about my new plates. I was told they were there waiting for me to pick up. No one decided to let me know. Since I live on an island in Alaska I told them they better hurry and send me the plates since they didn't bother to tell me they were in or send them out as soon as they got them.

Recommend their bento box meals which are basically all the same except for one entree item.  You have a variety of small bits of food, beautifully presented, reasonable cost.

453,"We live out in the Alaskan Bush, with no vet for 400 miles. When our dog started peeing blood and throwing up, we sought out a recommendation from our local dog rescue who pointed us to Midnight Sun. She is a very large pup (125lbs and lanky), and hates being away from her people, so I was nervous about shipping her out without us. From the moment she arrived at Midnight Sun, they were kind and communicative. They let me know when she arrived, and the vet herself (not a vet tech or receptionist, which is often the case) called to discuss her care, asking permission prior to performing X-rays, and patiently answering my questions even though it was late in the evening.  I am also in the medical field, which I did not disclose to her doctor at that time, and I was very impressed with how through she was, and how she spoke to me. She clearly is an animal lover and not just there for the income. I believe it was Doctor Hefley that I spoke with, but I'm not positive as it was late and I was exhausted. Luna had to spend the night due to flight times, and was to fly out the following day, but an incompetent courier service resulted in a second overnight stay. At this point I was really anxious to get my pup home, and I was delighted when one of the employees, Darby, called and asked if I would like pictures of Luna to settle my mind. Obviously I said yes. She was not in a crate, but a playpen with toys, getting attention from staff (I will say, she is a pro at getting attention ;) )

In regards to the cost of treatment: Yes, it's expensive. However, $200 for an X-ray is pretty standard at a vet. Vet fees vary for an office visit, but this is an emergency vet, so just like an ER visit for people, you have to assume a higher exam cost. This is not a lot cost clinic, however in being a pet owner, one must understand that there might be an emergency.  And unlike other vets that we have been to, we were not charged for repeat x-rays that they did to ""double check"" their own work the following morning.  Being a pet owner in a place that requires a flight and a courier to get my pup to the vet, I'm grateful that a place like Midnight Sun is there to treat her with compassion.",Visited

After asking to look at the breaks An employee felt the need to remove a break pad off the vehicle not replace it, sent the car out without a break pad and with each other pad under 1mm which is extremely hazardous. Could have easily ended in fatality especially in an Alaskan winter. Do not take your vehicle here if you want to look after your loved ones. I would not own a Subaru just to avoid dealing with this corrupt unethical and unprofessional company.

Their staff was very welcoming and friendly.  Everything was timely and the crew attentive.
The interior is modern and, as was shared by the staff, Finnish in design.  It creates a clean, well defined atmosphere.  The surfaces are fairly hard, so it could get fairly noisy.
The menu has a varied selection of offerings that play on the central chicken theme, but there are many non-chicken dishes.
This is a new-American take on fried chicken.  Southerners may be taken aback to find their chicken is not served on the bone, but this is not a detriment to the bird.  The spices and the breading are well balanced and does not mask the quality of the meat.
Both the light and dark meat are juicy and tender.  One white piece did come out overdone, but the staff was quick to bring a new breast which was fantastic.  Their speed and willingness to make the meal a memorable one is noteworthy.

Another review in a few weeks might provide a better idea of consistency and service.

We have given Hard Rock a couple tries, with hopes that we just had an off experience, but they have yet to prove us wrong.

If it weren't for the price tags, it wouldn't be as bad, but it's unfortunate when it costs $50.00+ for two people and you have no desire to finish the items you ordered.

The venue itself has a great atmosphere and they are in a great location, but the menu items and pricing could use some review.",Visited

There are rocks, ivory, skins, knick-knacks, post cards, touristy trinkets, jewelry, tshirts faded and dusty from years of waiting to find a home, and dream catchers which obviously had themselves fallen on hard times.  There are definitely interesting things to be found here,  but you're going to have to work through the disorganization to find them. The shopkeeper was nice.

943,"We spent $890 and they mistreated and caused the death of my 4 year old cat. I took her here after she wouldn't eat and barely drank for three days. The tech did a physical exam and then the vet drew blood and did one X-ray. They had to keep her overnight to hydrate her via IV fluids. 2 hours later we got a call saying that they looked in her mouth and found thread wrapped around her tongue and going down her throat (something they should have caught in the physical exam). So we ended up paying $350 for unnecessary tests. Then they charged me for sedatives to open her mouth and cut the string. They told then that they would have to get her into exploratory surgery that would cost an additional $2500 that I no longer had after having paid for tests and overnight fluids in advance. I had to decline the surgery (the lady at the front desk later openly admitted that they charge 3 times what any vet clinic would). The next morning I picked my cat up and the tech who brought my cat to me couldn't answer any questions about her health or even if she had a bowel movement to pass the thread. When I got my cat there was urine all over her and in the bottom of the crate. When we declined the surgery they threw her in the corner in her crate and didn't care to keep an eye on her health. They spent most of what I had to spare for cash and did nothing but prolong her passing. They quoted me an insane amount for euthanasia so I couldn't even afford to put her out of her pain. She wouldn't have survived the surgery because her liver and kidneys were in bad shape but they wanted to anyway. If you don't want to risk your loved ones here, don't go.",Rumor

The employees have good service.
In Dec 2011 one of my packages got mislabeled. The manager on duty looked for about 20 min, but I had to go home and find a tracking number, etc. Eventually the manager found the package. She stayed after hours on a Saturday to do this. It mean a lot, and I appreciate the effort. Thank you! (Forgot her name, but she was an older lady, and said she was new to Alaska...from Minnesota I think?)

But this post office has very long waits during busy hours of the day. I don't even bother going around morning, lunch or rush hour. 10-20 min wait is a norm.

And in 2008/09 I had a package WITH a tracking number get lost at this post office. I contacted the manager and she promised to get back to me. After numerous phone calls I got nothing. I lost about $40 dollars worth of merchandise.

In addition, I've had my box at this post office since 2007. Its now 2012, and I am still receiving letters addressed to the previous owners, and th owners before them. I have updated my ""contacts"" I placed the old owners on block lists, etc. But junk mail still comes. Its very frustrating. Its a waste of my time.

Worst of all is their policy of not accepting credit cards unless they are signed with a ""real"" signature. I use ""CHECK ID"" because I've had problems in the past. This post office will make you sign the card in front of them or they will not accept. I find this highly offensive and very annoying. The ""CHECK ID"" method is safer then a signature, and it only takes seconds to do. I use it to protect myself, and my finances. USPS is working against customers when enforcing their signature only policy. They have no right to dictate to customer what we can and cannot have on our credit cards. Its a safety concern, but their ""policy"" issue.

I am canceling my box soon. My future box will be with UPS.",Visited

I've had times where an order was placed and items were added to a burger that doesnt belong, when we called the manager said what do you expect me to do about it??? Meanwhile said person had no clue what even on said burger... There have been days when only 3 people were working one in the back preping, the other running around like a chicken with her head cut off literally doing everything from lobby and drive threw, to the griddle, and working the fryer... Meanwhile the ""manager"" was mainly standing there playing with her phone and watching this girl actually work... The only work this manager was doing was putting the sandwiches and burgers together, so instead of helping this employee actually put meals together, work the fryer, make eggs and lightening the load to be more productive, she stood and watched...

I go here everyday with my dogs, the pumping station for Anchorages human waste is right there & the access tunnel is on the beach.
When you get to the beach you can turn left & walk past the sewage plant (I gag & hold my breat it’s so bad) or you can turn right & you come to a horrible attempt to stop the hills erosion and the access pipe which will produce very foul odors. The locals like to spray paint some interesting things on it.
The beach is great otherwise beautiful views, mostly small rocks but very nice.
The parking lot is visited by public workers but if you lost something there it’s ok they don’t pick up. (I do!)
I’ve been harassed three times by the airport police trying to make a name for themselves. (Dogs in car relaxing after walking, never any tickets just harassment for being at the park first lol)

I've also noticed a very regular occurrence of them being very dishonest with friends I've sent here and overcharged for services, and not fixing the actual problem(s) originally stated.
Even my workplace will not bring any of their fleet to Capital Service because of the past issues with false billing statements, rude customer service, and generally not fixing the issues given.

That's the good part. Now the bad, when I was ordering my wrap I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap with onions and light Caesar dressing.  There was no option for spinach, which is what I wanted, so i assumed it came on the wrap seeing as that is what the picture showed. They had a lettuce option, but I much prefer spinach. Well, Instead of a chicken Caesar wrap I ended up with a blob of chicken in a wrap with Caesar dressing. I would have gone back, but I had to get back to work.

1. Avoid the shift change time between 5-6 PM. If the night shift employees are not on time then you'll have a 5 minute wait until an employee takes your order and a 15 minute wait to get your food. During the shift change the manager is doing inventory, so this also slows things down.

2. Use the Drive Thru. The Drive Thru is the priority over dine-in guests.

I noticed one employee had his music playing through his earphones while making the food and packaging it.

In my opinion this was the slowest service of all Wendy's restaurants in Anchorage, but the food tasted great.",Visited

The noodles are sticky and break, the broth is old and has a weak flavor, the bean sprouts have been brown and soggy, and the quality of the meat has gone down significantly.

In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor.

The assistants get you to try on their most expensive bras (the ones in the drawers) and lead you straight to them. I believe they get a commission/incentives because they asked if anyone helped you at checkout and the fitting room assistants give you a card with their name and you bra size on it.
Four of us went in. We waited at least an half hour in line to check out which was ridiculous since they only had one cashier up until the last 5 minutes.
I purchased 4 lingerie bags, vanilla body mist and I bought 4 of those bras that are in the drawer which clearly state on the outside what the bra size is. The manager was assisting me.
I drove home (well over an hour away) and while trying them on for my husband noticed one was a different size than the rest.
I spent over $200 and am disappointed that, even with assistance, I was given the wrong size bra because someone didn't keep their inventory straight.
Update: Went back today to return one that was uncomfortable and trade in the wrong size. They employees were still just as happy to assist and had no problem doing the transaction, exchange and return.

Service staff seemed clueless and/or new, not sure as to why it was so dosorganized. Decorated like a stockade for cattle, i was kind of worried of being branded if i took a wrong turn leaving the table.

Steakhouse, so of course i had the steak. It was nothing worth the postage to write about, fairly bland but it was cooked. Not the worst steak in town, but not befitting for the charge, luckily on this occasion it was free to me.",Visited

The rest of the dishes were a bit unsettling m underwhelming. They were good dishes and well prepared but somewhat lack luster in the taste.

The polenta was nicely fried but not much in flavor.  The sauce on the plate was a bit skimpy in proportion with the amount of polenta.

The mushrooms and the bits of roasted garlic were great but lots of oil that makes it very heavy.

You are fed and they even have a bar on board. The trip lasts for hours and they even bring aboard some pollution free old glacier ice to try.

He explained everything really well and gave me a lot of info I need to ensure my new home is well maintained. His report was excellent and will be referred to a lot as I go forward. He is also very honest...I paid extra for a thermographic imaging thinking it'll help me identify hear loss spots for winter, but he let me know that unless I do it in winter there won't be enough temperature differential to really identify anything useful. He allowed me to remove that service and didn't charge me despite having brought the equipment to do it.

We tend to be “church hoppers” we like visiting different styles and denominations of church to show our daughter the many different forms of Christian worship. This church is very modern and contemporary with a casual feel. The praise team is PHENOMENAL! They have complementary donuts and coffee and also additional treats and drinks for purchase at the cafe. Excellent children’s church as well. The only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sermons can sometimes feel a bit phony or forced. I’ve spoken with a few other people who also feel that one of the pastors tries to make himself cry and it feels forced and a bit awkward. But I still have enjoyed many sermons here.

2766,"First and foremost, understand one thing - - - you are traveling to a sign!! Just a sign. A sign in the middle of a cleared area with a restroom and pull over parking to pitch a tent or pull up an RV.
Traveling from North Pole was for sure an all day trip. We took the advise from other reviewers about the bumpy roads and ended up taking our full size truck. No, we did not have any broken windshields or have any tire blow outs. I do not know if we were lucky or if people over exaggerated on their reviews.
The reviews did not exaggerate about half the way the road not being paved. For almost half the miles driven we were not on a paved road. If you are a frightened driver - do not make this journey. There are parts of the roads where if you slide off, you’re not coming back and there’s constant semi trucks coming and going.
We also took our four dogs and there were plenty of stops to let them out.
There was a “gift shop” at some run down gas station about mid way but it proved to be quality merchandise. Not a lot of choices but worth it if you want a souvenir.
Once we got there, it was exactly what we thought. Just a sign and views of the Alaska Pipeline.

However we did get the salad with some adorable dipping sauce cups promptly 🤨. Took the stake home and ended up throwing it away. I usually don't give bad reviews, I just won't return to the establishment but this encounter had me feeling some kind of way down in my soul.

I also want the trail to be open and there is no time limit. After returning, I realized that the visitor center parking lot was closed at 5 pm. The troublesome staff was really sorry to help open the door. The other party said that it was his fault that he hadn't been reminded in advance, and encouraged us to park the car outside the roadside and go back to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Such politeness and kindness made me even more ashamed.

Visitor Center(09:00–17:00)參觀，可惜錯過下午四點的最後一場介紹影片。參觀展覽廳之後，就去走風景優美的步道，還想步道是開放的，沒有時間限制。返回後才知道遊客中心停車場在下午5點即關閉。勞煩工作人員幫忙開門實在很抱歉，對方還說是自己沒有事先提醒的錯，鼓勵我們把車子停在外面路邊，再回去享受美景，如此禮貌與盛情，讓我更加慚愧。",Rumor

3357,"I ALWAYS read reviews, so I thought it would only be right to leave one to help others out. Today is my husbands birthday, and this place was NOTHING SHORT of making it special. I am BEYOND picky... but EVERYTHING we had was good. They close the kitchen at 10, we arrived at 9:52, and they STILL allowed us to dine there. That was the first plus( & not once were they snooty or rushing us because of the time) the waiter was super friendly and very attentive. Our food was cooked quickly... another plus, and it wasn't half done. It was still cooked to our liking. I'm usually hard on my reviews, but I give this place 5+ stars. They were pretty pricey, but I didnt expect anything less because, of course, I read the other reviews, lol and I expected it anyway(because I figure it was a ""classy"" type of place). But I didnt mind because it was for my husband. And I thought the portions were worth the price, it was enough to fill us up. So I was happy about it, over all. We will more than likely return here before we leave alaska and I would recommend it to others as well...

3402,"Both times we have received our food from this BurgerFi we haven't received all of what we ordered. We have no issue with the quality of the food, the Beyond Burgers are amazing and the fries are great.. however we have to take into account the lack of attention the staff pays to the orders. When dining in they did not give us all of our fry orders, and stated that we had to show receipt in order to receive them because they didn't think they made a mistake. Second time was a to-go order and we ordered a burger with mushrooms and garlic aoili, and also fries with a kids meal. When we got home the burger was completely missing the mushrooms and garlic aoili, and we had no kids fry. That really sucks that you trust staff to actually READ the order that was placed and give you what you paid for, but instead you get home and are really disappointed that you have missing items. If we return we will be checking every bag and item to make sure we actually receive what we order.

Sidenote for this location.. be careful if you park out of view of your vehicle because we were the lucky recipients of gas siphoning our first visit. Real nice to work to pay for gas and just have someone steal it while you are feet away enjoying food with your family.",Visited

I will not hesitate to contact them whenever their services are needed in our home.  They are great and they made our house livable for the long term.

3475,"Where to start? If you come to Anchorage and don’t find your way to the Moose’s Tooth (or their sister location, the Bear Tooth) you have done your travel planning all wrong. The place is an experience, the pizza unique and delicious, the beer is some of the best brewed in Alaska. Their brand swag is worn proudly by locals...which says a lot. Of course, a popular place like this requires a wait (no reservations). We always get drinks and play charades. The Backpacker’s Pizza is one of our favorites but there is no bad choice. Their home brew root beer and cream soda are worth the calories as is the Hungarian Mushroom Soup (and I don’t even really like mushrooms). The beer selection is wide and it is worth noting that many competing restaurants carry their brews. If you are having a special event, they have a side room that they rent at certain days/times during the week. In addition to fantastic food they host First Tap Thursday’s and many concerts during the year...so be sure to check their website. They are also a great spot for to-go orders as they have designated parking and registers for those picking up. The staff is a mix of familiar faces who have been there forever and teens and college students who have always been welcomed as employees. Everyone is friendly and they have creative combo suggestions, so make sure to ask! If you want the experience but not the wait, I’ve found that between 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. the crowd thins a bit and tables turn over quickly.

3665,"Leroy's has always been a favorite of mine. However since the new management took over the food has downhill. Undercooked meat, undercooked eggs, ham is cold and the biscuits and gravy look and taste like they microwaved it after it was frozen. The waitresses are over worked and miss tables. I waited 20 minutes to have my order taken and it took almost another 30 to get the food. My farmers skillet was undercooked, I didn't get the side of hash browns I ordered, but I was charged for them. My orange juice was warm and my friend I was dining with had ordered 3 Scrambled eggs and 2 sausage links. His eggs were undercooked, runny, and the sausage was still cold on the insides. I saw the owners with their family in the far corner and waitresses were giving them all the service, doing their best yet I still saw an Asian man and older woman snapping for coffee refills and water.

When you own a business you should put other paying customers first.

To the waitresses at Leroys, keep up the great work. Your customer service and attempts to keep a brave face is why I used to come back.

After 4 TERRIBLE experiences in a row, I give up. Kavas and kriners diner are my new go tos.

When the owners are this terrible no wonder Leroy's has gone so far downhill. I only hope you can recover. Stop rushing your chefs. Make your food fresh. Or you'll be making a lot of people sick, like you have me and my friends.

Everyone that ordered a menu item that they knew was a dish that is traditionally spicy was presented with a meal so spicy hot it was almost inedible, and the plate was covered in dangerous little spicy peppers.  My Asian chicken salad was quite possibly the most underwhelming meal I've ever had at a restaurant, and the chicken was so dry.  I feel poorly about leaving such a negative review, but I don't want anyone else to waste their money and precious vacation time when they could find a better meal out in Juneau.",Visited

I went to this store because the information I found online said the game I wanted was in stock, (and it was). As I realize after 10 min of searching that Its not on shelves I wonder where the employees are. Only person I was able to locate was the cashier all the way in the front of the store, I realize she wasn't able to leave her station, so I asked if she could send someone my way, which she did as I had listened for her request. After standing around in the game section for another 10 min I see 3 employees just hovering and I snag one from the lap top section. He ultimately was unfamiliar but successful in assisting me. took about 25min to find what I needed and get out. One item. What really was bothersome is that this is my typical best buy experience for years, and I finally just am fed up. I understand full and well that people like browsing at best buy, however it shouldn't take such measures to be noticed, and assisted. I felt bothersome, and if that's how others feel too, I understand why the store looks like a ghost town 90% of every time I go in.",Visited

Cars are not allowed beyond the bus station. You must buy a bus ticket to go to Eielson Visitor Center. If you buy a bus ticket, you can get off the bus at any stop and catch another bus later. The only problem with this is, the buses are really full, and it's very hard to find a bus that has room for you. At Eielson there is a ranger that will put you on a waiting list, and they control how many people get back on the buses from there so it is easier to get back on a bus there than at other stops.
I should also add, there is no where to buy food or drinks past the bus station, so make sure you bring all you will need for a full days' adventure! Eielson has picnic tables where you can eat lunch if you brought it. It also has a couple of small trails to beautiful views.",Visited

Which is no problem but i got a babysitter so i didn't have to be three feet from a grumpy child at 10 pm. Husband talked to the host who moved us into the bar area great no kids in sight. However he seated us about a foot away from a nice edlerly man having a quiet dinner again no big deal just makes it uncomfortable to talk about anything vaguely ""romantic"". They weren't full at all only a handful of tables enough space to give people a buffer between them. Bartender was so nice food was good i wish i remembered her name she did very good and knowing when to stay away and when to bring things. Overall good experience.",Visited

Unfortunately, Black Cup's new look just isn't as warm and appealing to me as it was before the remodel. It seems kind of cold now. 😔 So I'm giving this a 4/5 instead of 5/5 because it's just not the kind of place where I want to spend much time. This works okay for KB because I pop in, grab a cup and go, leaving tables for others who like the new look. I frequent their other locations more often since the remodel. (Photo added 9/1/18)",Rumor

I called two times before arriving to make sure they had room for 2 people. They insisted that they had 26 spots left. So I made the hour and a half drive to get told they are full. After having to talk to 5 people they finally found room. Once you get to the top you better pack warm. They have a yurt at the top but it didn't get above 3 degrees whole being inside of the yurt dispute having a fire going. All and all I would suggest you take your money elsewhere.",Rumor

When I approached a Kohl's associate to ask about a pair of blue slacks, she dropped what she was doing and took me to the right area and as I told her my situation, she actively listened to me and continued to assist me, taking me straight to what I was looking for. I purchased three items instead of just one thanks to ""Michelle""! I have a UAA class on Friday night's ""Customer Service 101"" which has made me not only more aware of myself as a sales associate but also more aware of how I am treated as a customer.

Service has gradually gotten worse over the years. Been going to food factory since they had a location out in North Pole. The food is hit and miss. Sometimes it's really really good, but other times it's just ok. Lately tho there has been something going on with the Crispy Yukon wings. The last 2 orders I've gotten have had issues with the breading. Something has changed with how it sticks to the chicken. It just falls off with the slightest touch now and you basically eat bland wings. Makes me sad as this is the main reason I go to food factory. I hope the owner reads this and figures out what's going on. The waitress even acknowledged that there was something wrong with the wings and asked me a few times if id like something else.",Visited

4823,"(Translated by Google) The second largest national park in the United States after Yellowstone, with the highest peak in North America, McKinley, as well as many wild animals such as grizzly bears, reindeer, wolves, and foxes. The endless scenery is breathtaking. .

The official opening of the park is usually from the end of May to mid-September. Since Denali Park is the only sub-polar national park in the world, it will enter the Arctic Circle 200 miles further north, so there are 9 months of this year. The park was closed due to heavy snow. Primitive, vast, and magnificent, this shock is beyond words.

The best place for travelers to take pictures is the Horseshoe Lake in the park. The dazzling Horseshoe Lake is another wilderness picture that washes the soul. The scenery there will be so beautiful that you forget to press the shutter, or even forget. Blink and breathe. All this can only be experienced when you are on the scene.

仅次于黄石的美国第二大国家公园，拥有北美最高峰麦金利山(McKinley)，还有大灰熊、驯鹿、狼、狐狸等众多野生动物，天水相依、一望无际的景色更是摄人心魄。

公园正式开放一般是在5月底-9月中旬，由于迪纳利公园是全球唯一的一个处于副极地的国家公园，它再往北200英里便进入北极圈了，所以全年有9个月这个公园因被大雪覆盖而关闭。原始、广袤、壮美，这种震撼是无法用语言形容的。

旅行者的绝佳拍景地要数公园内的马蹄湖了，光彩夺目的马蹄湖，又是另外一幅洗涤心灵的荒野画卷，那里的景色将会美到让你忘记按下快门，甚至忘记眨眼和呼吸。这一切，只有身临其境才能体会。",Visited

When you pull on the door handles they almost pull out

Looked like they tried to glue the driver handle on with glue and it ran down the door and now I have to paint the drivers door
The person that detailed it did the worst job ever and didn't wipe all the white stuff they strayed and didn't vacuum the soap off the floor boards good enough
Then went to replace my head lights and you have to take the head lights out and they were brokenot tabs and only 2 bolts holding them in and they wereally up top. Should have a total of 5 bolts holding them in and they cut the old headlights out and left the wires bare and did not close the wires right

6063,"The customer service in the service department is incredible when I went in for a easy issue.  The problem is their service supervisor (male) is absolutely rude and does not clearly communicate.  In addition, completely misrepresented a conversation to his advantage.  Sad to say but the feedback that I was given before going in was that he was not easy to work with and it turned out it was true.  When trying to address the issue he shut me down and told me to pick up my vehicle.  If I owned this dealership, I would do some re-education on listening and communication skills.  Won’t come back and will use the only power I have, my voice to redirect people elsewhere.

Additionally, using the ‘I am new’ from the young lady in service does not excuse you from being rude and lazy. If you want to keep a job.  Go out of your way and don’t be snarky.",Visited

The Muskie is a always lively.  Its made more so by having a good attitude and being patient.  Once seated, service is pretty fast.  Portions are large, so plan to being food home.  If you are in Girdwood at the hotels, use a shuttle or carpool.  Parking can be a hastle, so reducing cars in the lot is nice where you can, plus this also promotes responsible fun.

6260,"I have lived here for a year, now, (came from Houston, TX) and have come to terms with not finding an exceptional Mexican restaurant. Because I've had bad food at Garcia's, Chepo's, Jalapeños, QDOBA, La Cabaña, and Xalos I cringe at the thought of eating Mexican, here. [Note: I do think Tequila 61 has great food but i wouldnt consider it a mexican restaurant since it doesnt serve traditional mexican food]. That being said, my hubby convinced me to try this ""new"" restaurant (Gallo's) since he thought it was good. I have to say that Gallo's is, by far, the best mexican restaurant, HERE, that ive tried. Gallo's actually tastes like Mexican food and its good. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because they let me down on dessert. I ordered the fried ice cream, which is ice cream covered with corn flakes and fried. As soon as I ate a spoonful I could tell it wasnt fresh (i.e. the corn flakes were stale). On the other hand, my husband enjoyed his flan. Desserts dont make up a food restaurant so i will definitely be going back or, at least, having my hubby pick some up on his way home since we live in ER. Definitely recommend.

Wanted to give my support although the service doesn't justify going back. The food was decent but the poor service was disappointing despite my super fat tip for take out. They forgot the side dishes for a pricey entree and didn't identify the order with my name so I never got 'curbside delivery', order was late, no receipt, and food was cold by the time I got it after walking in to see what was going on. The staff at curbside pickup seemed confused.

I don't eat this style often, closest i get is maybe taco night at home. Therefore, i asked the waitress, politely, as to what some things were and the differences between them. From what i gathered, there was little to no difference; some things had a bag of cheese from Costco on it, while some things were a bit more reserved.

It seems the health concerns of this place are still very real, but there were enough people inside when i went to warrant saying people either like it regardless or have not heard. 3/5 for my experience alone, 1/5 for being a hazard to public safety.",Visited

The prices are in the same range as other upscale Anchorage restaurants, but you won't break the bank and the quality of the food is worth every penny. You'll be left alone to enjoy your meal for a comfortable amount of time, yet your water will never run empty and the servers have endless suggestions for pairings and meal questions.

Out of potato soup salad, changed it to chili. Both BLT & chili were DELICIOUS! Husband's club was also very good. Both sandwiches had LOTS of bacon and veggies!!😋 Chili & salad was also tasty. We couldn't resist the bread pudding, it's usually amazingly good! Unfortunately, it was NOT. They must've changed it. The bread pudding was very dry.

7638,"Interesting to see how other rate a used car sales place as five stars or ""top notch"".  I guess I have a slightly different view.   First off, yes, their sales pitch is pretty easy and alluring: a hands-off, no pressure approach.  You cansign out cars to test drive..  You can walk on the lot and not a single salesperson will bother you.  And yes, buying the car itself is easy.  However, no matter how you look at it, you're not getting a good deal.  All of the sales tactics are easy when you're in Fairbanks.  The competition  is pretty limited, and any of the new car dealers in town make it easy to come to a place like this.  They promote a no haggle price, and sadly most people fall for it.  Check it out people: you're supposed to negotiate the deal.  However, again, because it's Fairbanks, the upper hand lies with them.  Here's what I say.  Do your research on the vehicle you need.  Shop across the state, including Anchorage.  And do not put yourself in a position where you desperately need a car.  You will get screwed.  They'll also tell you that they charge a $250 fee for registering a vehicle and make it seem like its convienent for you, but be aware.  You're getting robbed.  Titling a vehicle in Alaska costs $15 and registration is $100 for two years.  So it's hard to say that the extra $135 is worth the 20 minutes in DMV.  Yes, DMV in Fairbanks  is pretty efficient plus they serve a very small population. For registration you're never in there that long.  So, don't get stuck having to buy a car, plan that purchase well in advance.  DO negotiate the price with them.  Get your own financing, you'll get a better rate at the bank or credit union, and don't let them tell you that their registration fees are saving you time.  All it does is make them more money.  Yes, the sales guys are nice and helpful.  But that's how you make money.  Are they better than the Chevy dealer?  I'd say so.  But the bottom line is they do massive monthly turnover so they're making a nice percentage off the public.  Good luck.",Rumor

And while the staff were refreshing (Pablo was excellent and candid), knowing only the ""fresh halibut"" special was fresh and that the regular on-menu halibut couldn't be guaranteed as fresh was a sign of the menu's limits on freshness.

They put my receipt behind them on the counter and let it be.

I have been purchasing products and service from the Woodway for several years now. We purchased a new wood stove a few years back and had some on going issues that were part of a design flaw with the stove. The guys were extremely helpful and knowledgeable in resolving the issue. They went above and beyond what they needed to do and replaced the stove with a model that I am very happy with.

As a small business owner myself, I like to deal with companies that have the same customer service approach as I do. They are very knowledgeable and seem to know what matters most, the service after the sale.

I would recommended the Wood way to any one in the interior for their heating, small engine and service needs.

The woman behind the glass window when you walk in...she needs to remember that SHE is there to serve patients and thus should perhaps consider a smile and kindness.  Afterall, it is the patients who generate the income to pay her.

My exam with Dr Fortson was rushed, impersonal, and uncomfortable.  I spoke with a friend about her experience with Dr Fortson (unfortunately AFTER my visit) and she said the same-there's ZERO connectability with Dr Fortson.  Although she asked if I had any questions, I felt like she was already onto the next patient and therefore I did not want to ""hold her up"" any longer even though she had just spent a whoppin' 3-4 minutes doing a ""potential cancer spots"" visual scan of my body.

This experience left MUCH to be desired!!

Since my original review I've visited maybe 5-6 times and each visit leaves me just a little bit upset. I just had the worst pizza I've ever ordered. The ingredients seem cheaper or not as fresh the pizza was cooked way to long leaving my favorite part, the crust, litterally inedible. The salad bar was understocked and looked terrible and the new server we had was not very attentive.

The burger was comparable to a Burger King burger that sat on the grill too long and cost 18.99.   Service was almost non existent and I had to get up an find the waitress 3 times; twice to correct the orders missing half the food and another to get a drink.
I am an Alaskan and can say this place is a rip-off even for us locals. They cater to  tourists who don't know any better and have $$$ to blow using the ""Deadliest Catch"" name to lure you in and make you believe your getting something that can't be had elswhere for a reasonable price.  And they're business model touting that all profits go to charity is laughable.  They wouldn't  survive more than a few months in the restaurant business if that was true...",Visited

In their not so busy times, service is TYPICALLY well above par.

If your like me and my son, their menu leaves A LOT to be desired.  There's more fish on the menu and if you're allergic to fish it's quite difficult to eat anything here.

This has been brought up several times, and the normal response is ""well, we've got burgers."".

But their fries are cooked in the same oil as fish so you can't have those.

This has left us with going there once every 2-3 years.",Visited

A couple years ago I was having some car trouble. I had a 2003 Honda Civic that had been passed down through multiple people in my family that did not take care for the car. When I finally got the car there was over 500,000 miles on it, it was beat up, and had many little problems (like windows and locks not working).

I brought my car in to Continetal and they then went through the LONG process of getting everything fixed for me. Unfortunately, there was a much needed replacement to the t-belt I could not get due to trying to save up and get a new car. The plan was to fix up all the problems of this car and to buy a new one....yeah, that didn't exactly go as planned.

A couple weeks passed and, as predicted by Continetal, the t-belt broke while on my morning commute to work. As it flung off it hit my engine, creating a huge hole in the side of it. Unfortunately at that point all the bandaids weren't enough to save that car.

I then had to go through the process of buying a new car. The staff on the sales side are just as amazing! I explained my situation and I was helped tremendously! I ended up test driving the 2016 HR-V and fell in love instantly! I bought the car that night!

Now, I only visit for the occasional tire and oil change. And every time I am greeted by the friendly staff, some that recognize me from the horrible Civic experience :D.

I would give 5 stars for this restaurant if they made it easier for large groups to make reservations in advance. Working in a military unit, we have many going aways and baby showers, etc, and we can't reserve seating for these events. First come, first serve basis. Sometimes we will go elsewhere just to ensure we can have enough seating for everyone depending on the event.  Although I respect and understand this business decision, it's odd given the fact we are a local organization... I feel there could be a better relationship there.",Rumor

9039,"Food was average to good this time in the portions were good sometimes food quality is poor and portions are small

The main issue this time was that our waitress made a mistake in our bill on the first bill she forgot to include one drink a beer

The beer was equal to a $6 charge so she brought the first bill out which was a total of $117.30 and my wife gave her pretty much

So then my wife gave her $150.30 to pay for the bill she took it up and then added the extra $6 and brought it back without telling my wife about an mistake

So my wife figured she got the wrong change in knew something was wrong

So what the waitress did was switch to the new bill with the added $6 but completely try to lie about it she had no reason to lie about it but she made up of big fat story which was totally stupid and ridiculous all she had to do was tell the truth about the mistake of not including the $6 drink

So we confronted her and we knew that we saw the original bill was $117.30 and she finally admitted that she might have changed the receipts the bill but she wouldn't completely admit to the mistake the whole thing was simply ridiculous on her part and there would have been no issues if she just would have told the truth

We very seldom go there anymore because of the little issues that keep cropping up we went there for our son's youngest son's birthday it'll probably be another 6 months before we go back",Visited

However even after saleing to Safeway they have been my preference. However Dan whom is the store manager at this location is quickly changing that to the point Id just assume deal with the pain in the rear parking at Fredmyers considering you will still be done after driving a little bit further and fighting a bigger parking lot than the slow checkouts due to lack of manpower at Carrs. Never mind getting service. And it is no fault of the employees as they try very hard. 95 percent of the store employees are excellent and they will tell you the same thing. Dan is an idiot.

When she's not there, you can tell. The orders get messed up or mistaken, the pacing is chaotic, the same questions are asked multiple times, they argue with the customers, they ""bark"" at each other, and they are unbelievably rude.

Please train your staff and follow up on that training. You have a pretty good burrito. It's not worth the frustration of your staff.

TO THE RESPONSE: You're right. I reviewed while upset after several weeks of consecutive bad experiences and that was not fair of me. We have enjoyed your burritos and recommended you to our friends and family for many years so I've changed my stars to 3. I'll change it to 4 if you bring back the jalapeño coins ;)",Visited

Seriously though - From the minute I placed the order up until delivery: 21 minutes. I considered knocking a star for the dough..I have a feeling it has to do with how quickly they cook the pies, and it could have been a tad crispier - but my air fryer can take care of that! :)

The pizza itself was delicious. I ordered online for 20% off my order, and I got the All-Meat Large, half Cheese only. The meat is juicy and fresh, and doesn't fall all over the place with each bite you take.

Cheese is perfectly cooked, down to the light brown bubbling on the mozzarella.

12/10 will order again. Prices are $1 less per pie VS Pizza Hut. No-Brainer.

We bought a fridge on the 15th to be delivered on the 17th. I checked the delivery queue and verified we were set for delivery with Chris in appliances. On the 17th, I called Home Depot to verify the delivery time only to find out that I was ""accidentally removed from the delivery schedule."" I told the guy that we'd just take a refund and buy somewhere else since we needed a fridge immediately. Mike, the supervisor on duty, ended up getting a team together and delivered the fridge himself.

Mike said he'd replace a refrigerator door that he damaged during installation on the 17th.  After contacting him on the 22nd, he said he still had to talk to his manager about the replacement. Amazing. I asked him when we could expect the replacement delivery and he gave no response. It's now the 26th and I'm still babysitting this inept do-nothing trying to get my fridge fixed.

I just contacted Jared, an assistant store manager, to see what's going on with the lack of everything customer service at this store.

It's very sad that the homeless people who hang around here often make the park an
unpleasant place to be.

Years ago there was a very nice boardwalk overlooking the creek where visitors could sit and rest and look at the fish. Because of the dunks that constantly hung out there and passed out on the deck they were removed.

Even with the boardwalk removed, drunks still hang out in the park and four letter words are often shouted in ear shot of little children.

Fortunately the drunks don't hang around the playground that often, it's mostly in the woods and in the entrance to the park

I don't recommend going into the park at night by yourself, especially if you are female or have little children with you.

Perhaps if the rescue mission on Tudor relocated to a different place then the park will be a better place to visit. I've spoken with many of the drunks who hang out in the park, and many of them congregate because they get locked out of the rescue mission at night because they have been drinking.

It's still a great park though, and as long as you are aware of your surroundings and enter the park on the playground side then you shouldn't have too much to worry about",Rumor

However... our waitress noticed we had left some on the plate and SHE was the one that asked if it was raw and offered to take it off our check. Excellent service!

We gave it another chance a couple weeks ago and everyone in my party really enjoyed what they got. We actually had the same waitress again! Surely she didn't remember us but this time the cinnamon roll was cooked perfectly. Definitely one of my Fairbanks favorites.",Visited

Updated review

I have come here four times in the last two months so I waited before changing my original review from two years ago. There’s usually a wait in the drive-through per usual with most fast food places but the service and the food were both great enough for us to keep coming back and here I am on a Friday night it’s 8 o’clock and I don’t wanna make dinner so I stop over here and I am happy to say I will be back.
Im thinking they have new management and employees so I’m a happy customer again

2019- 1STAR
Im not a fan of burger king i never wanna go here but once in a blue moon someone well wanna go try something new and see. And we have done this For many years on and off never experiencing anything good enough to keep us as customers. So we went to Burger King to try the new tacos I get it it’s Burger King and tacos should not be at a burger joint but I digress it tasted gross it was flat it was hard it did not come off fresh or crispy,it wasn’t good in anyway.
Not to mention their service is really bad at all the burger kings but the diamond one takes the cake. The manger lady was so short with me, didn’t wanna explain what’s on a certain burger I inquired about, and worst part if it all was her condescending way of talking.

*another note*
They do NOT accept or take any coupon from the burger king app. Basically they promote the app and using the discounts on the walls and doors of store but they don’t accept it. Annoyed its 2019 people",Visited

After viewing the falls from the top lookout, make sure you spend the 10 minutes to down to the river and get right up close to the falls.  For most of winter, the falls are 90% frozen and the resulting river is likewise almost completely frozen.

Be careful if venturing out near or on the ice.  Entire ice shelves will move out from underneath you, especially if you and your crew of children jump up and down without abandon...umm...well, you get what you deserve -- like my son's very cold and wet feet.  In all seriousness, don't let your kids too far from reach; it can be very slippery and dangerous but absolutely an incredibly beautiful place.  And yet only 30 minutes from Anchorage!",Rumor

While boarding is 1/2 hour prior to departure, I recommend to start getting in line a little earlier.  First in line, first to choose your seat on board.  If you do not get sea sick, I recommend the top cabin.

Our captain, Captain Dan was great.  He was not only experienced but highly knowledgeable about marine life.  I really did feel like he wanted us to have the best experience possible.

On our tour we saw otters, a pair of fin whale (which I hear is rare in the coast), a pod of orcas, sea lions, puffin including tufted, dall's porpoise and even a bald eagle.

Seeing the Aliak Glacier up close was a big treat too.

Our driver Guss explained why it got the name Turn Again. There was not much narration on the tour - the driver was a senior gentleman.

The bathroom fan in our room was horrible! It was so loud that you couldn't run it except for an emergency circumstance.

Management of this hotel was another matter. We sprayed our room is Ozium when we left and got assaulted by a clerk accusing up from smoking in the room. We told him we didn't smoke in the room but I'd use Ozium. They didn't care they said they had to put a ozone unit in the room and charge us $250. The room had for Windows that all opened and had screens. If they wanted to remove the smell of the Ozium all they had to do is open the windows for 15 minutes and the road would be probably purged of any and all odors. Management in patiently explained they had procedures and that opening the windows is not what they did. What they did was put an ozone machine in the room and charge the client $250

We talked to the manager and told him if the room didn't are out and he was going to charge us to call us so we can come by and check out the room ourselves. He said he would call us if he was going to charge us but never did and then the next day you put a charge on our bill and would not discuss it. He did not call us allow us the opportunity to inspect the room as promised!

We read the terms of the contract and we had violated none of them as there was no smoking smoking apparatus signs of smoking or smoking paraphernalia in the room according to the manager and yet he still charge this rather than just opening the windows to remove the air freshener weed put in the room.

Management attitude seemed to be if they enjoyed gouging their customers rather than providing them with as good a service as possible.

This management needs to go to customer service school cuz they think the object is to destroy their relationship with customers rather than to try to make things agreeable and to even honor their promises to call us before building our room.

10349,"Pet friendly, clean rooms. Excellent housekeeping. Especially Jessie.

Great breakfast every morning until 10am enjoyed from the Glacier View room above the Lobby.

We stayed in the Annex building where the cigarette receptacle is away from the building next to a picnic table, making sure no one has to walk through smoke to get to their rooms.

A nice grassy area for pets to relieve themselves. Pooch baggies provided above a waste basket.

I absolutely love this place.

From the desk clerk to the breakfast staff to the housekeepers. All smiles and accomadating even though we needed to extend our stay unexpectedly one day at a time. (Husband's work) I don't recommend attempting this during peak season.

Laundry facilities, average size fridges, microwaves in each room.
Great location close to downtown, the Spit, several restaurants, museum.

This is also home to the Otter Room where adults can get libations and food.",Visited

Northern Japan has some of the best mountains in the world, and they charge almost half the price (powder guaranteed).  Even some of the ""hills"" around Fairbanks offers more features for less.

They DO have great security here, you can rest easy at night knowing your personal belongings & vehicles are safe and sound. But
honestly they need to hire a MORE PROFESSIONAL, OLDER  person that is actually EDUCATED in the position. If I would have know previously that it would have taken 3 days to store my car because the office attendent is to slow and didn't know the process. I would have take it somewhere else.",Rumor

Jacob was great from start to finish. Very professional and courteous, and he seriously wants to work with you to make sure he gets your business. With as many options as there are for auto glass repair in Anchorage, the dedication to the customer is what sets these guys apart. He's been in the business for over 10 years, is very knowledgeable, and has great connections with different companies and warehouses to get you the best price possible.

They were very understanding when I talked about pricing from other shops, and will absolutely meet or BEAT any price you can show him from Safelite or any other shop in town. I personally don't use Groupon, but they offer amazing deals on chip repairs and full replacements that are worth checking out.

You'll love Lenny, the shop dog. While he may be intimidating to some, he loves people and keeps you company while you wait. Speaking of waiting, you won't be doing much if it... the shop has a great turnaround! I was in and out in less than an hour for a full replacement.

Jacob made sure I was happy, as well as informed with their process. I even found out the last glass was done improperly by another shop, and why they knew. Great aftercare tips to ensure the job lasts.

Lastly, they have an amazing warranty... Lifetime for any faults with the glass (manufacturer defects, non-rock breaks, etc.), as well as a 30-day rock chip fix guarantee.

Like I said, I won't be going anywhere else. I'll be bringing my next glass needs to them... and suggest you do the same.",Rumor

Went on a Thursday night and all of their tables were full which was fine because I was still able to sit at the bar. The bartender took around 10 minutes to give us a menu and say hi but poured many drinks for others right infront of me spilling multiple times. Took 50 minutes to get our two tacos and a enchilada. The beef was completely unseasoned. There was a party of 5 in the back which took all three servers they had that night to attend to them. My wife ordered the house margarita and it tasted like dish soap. The couple that was next to us that was there before us never got their food and tried to pay for their beer and leave. They were told the food would be free but to wait 5 minutes for it because it was already done. After 10 minutes of waiting for the food they just left.   The staff did say sorry to us for taking so long and gave my wife a free shot of tequila. We will never be back.,Visited

10845,"Found a great rate on this place through a third-party hotel booking site. Considering the price, I wasn’t expecting much, but was surprised that the rooms were large, and ""reasonably"" clean. There was some rust/grime around the drain in the bathtub, a stain on the carpet, and a messed up wall. For the price, I'd say these are all minor, aside from the issue in the bath.

My biggest issue was that the Wi-Fi was not working on my floor during my stay (March 16-19). This was a pretty big deal for me. The front desk acknowledged the issue and suggested that I try connecting to another floor. Unfortunately, I just wasn’t able to get a good connection by doing this. I ended up burning through a ton of data on my mobile, and had to drive elsewhere to avoid missing an assignment deadline.

I was also pretty excited about the free continental breakfast, but they stop serving it at 9, so I wasn’t able to take advantage of it. 9 am seems early to stop serving breakfast, especially for people on vacation and coming from different time-zones.

Also, someone had very clearly smoked pot in the elevator, which I realize isn’t the hotel’s fault, but maybe something to consider if you’re traveling with children, or if you prefer to avoid staying in a place that attracts those kinds of guests.

All in all, I’d say if you’re looking for a cheap bed consider here if you don’t mind a rougher crowd, semi-clean rooms, and aren’t depending on reliable Wi-Fi. Personally, I won't be staying here again and wouldn't recommend it  to others.",Rumor

Updated review

I have come here four times in the last two months so I waited before changing my original review from two years ago. There’s usually a wait in the drive-through per usual with most fast food places but the service and the food were both great enough for us to keep coming back and here I am on a Friday night it’s 8 o’clock and I don’t wanna make dinner so I stop over here and I am happy to say I will be back.
Im thinking they have new management and employees so I’m a happy customer again

2019- 1STAR
Im not a fan of burger king i never wanna go here but once in a blue moon someone well wanna go try something new and see. And we have done this For many years on and off never experiencing anything good enough to keep us as customers. So we went to Burger King to try the new tacos I get it it’s Burger King and tacos should not be at a burger joint but I digress it tasted gross it was flat it was hard it did not come off fresh or crispy,it wasn’t good in anyway.
Not to mention their service is really bad at all the burger kings but the diamond one takes the cake. The manger lady was so short with me, didn’t wanna explain what’s on a certain burger I inquired about, and worst part if it all was her condescending way of talking.

*another note*
They do NOT accept or take any coupon from the burger king app. Basically they promote the app and using the discounts on the walls and doors of store but they don’t accept it. Annoyed its 2019 people",Visited

Slow service and horrible food. $30 for shellfish fettuccini which consisted of 3 over cooked dry shrimp, 3 under cooked scallops, and a pile of dry noodles with cheese. No sauce whatsoever and very, very dry!
Took a long time to receive our ""reserved"" table and our food.

Because I've had bad food at Garcia's, Chepo's, Jalapeños, QDOBA, La Cabaña, and Xalos I cringe at the thought of eating Mexican, here. [Note: I do think Tequila 61 has great food but i wouldnt consider it a mexican restaurant since it doesnt serve traditional mexican food]. That being said, my hubby convinced me to try this ""new"" restaurant (Gallo's) since he thought it was good. I have to say that Gallo's is, by far, the best mexican restaurant, HERE, that ive tried. Gallo's actually tastes like Mexican food and its good. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because they let me down on dessert. I ordered the fried ice cream, which is ice cream covered with corn flakes and fried. As soon as I ate a spoonful I could tell it wasnt fresh (i.e. the corn flakes were stale). On the other hand, my husband enjoyed his flan. Desserts dont make up a food restaurant so i will definitely be going back or, at least, having my hubby pick some up on his way home since we live in ER. Definitely recommend.

Our server eventually showed, took our drink order and disappeared before we could even give our appetizer choices. She did promptly return and we place our appetizer order. Pretzel and cheese was good. Nachos were huge but bland and lacked flavored. For dinner the kids chicken tenders, (horrible, looked like banquet tenders and tasted like fish) both my husbands burger and mine were just bland. I got excited when I saw poutin on the special menu and paid an extra $9 for it just to be horribly let down. Over done fries with deep fried mozzarella balls cost on top and a gravy that tasted like what a can of Alpo smells like. Horribly disappointed. For $78 no less!!! I did take the half eatin burger and ""alpo"" home to my dog 🐶. He seemed to like it.",Visited

After 5-10 minutes they finally had the right item and price.  Lowe's your employees did everything right except they didn't listen to the customer.  I highly suggest having the bar codes printed on the wood, but that may be a manufacture issue to resolve.  Otherwise I got what I wanted even if it took a bit longer to checkout.

My only complaint is the amount of rice. Which is normal for a burrito this big- theres always a ton of rice. Luckily it tasted good too. Get the sauce because I feel without it, it would taste a little dry. Would be nice if they kept the portion size the same while getting rid of some of the rice.

11604,"This hamburger restaurant is piece of Anchorage diner history. The setting is soothing and enjoyable, not typically found in a hamburger joint.

The walls are covered in photographs & storied descriptions of many long time patrons of this establishment and its connection to Anchorage.

There is a wood burning fireplace that helps add to the ambiance of the dine-in experience.

The menu is straight forward comfort food.

Arctic Burgers are the staple menu item and delicious, reminding me of burgers from my youth.
They are a value, in Achorage, at ~ 7$ [11/2018] for a hand made, well seasoned 1/4 Lb. hamburger patty. The fries appear to be hand cut too, and the homemade onion ring, though a little greasy, are delicious.

The fixings bar included hot pickles (really good), dill pickles, onions, salsa (homemade) & more.

The Soda fountain is nearby, and all you can drink!

This is good follow-up service and I hope that people receive this level of service on the front line in the future. We will try CSP again to see if we have a better experience. // Updated as of 2020-07-21: We used to love this place. We used them year after year to process all manner of seafood. But this year has been a completely different experience. First, the quality of the processing is horrible now; look at the photo. Our halibut was brought in the same as every other year and yet this is the terrible product we received. Second, their hours have changed greatly whereby they are closed during the times that people bring in and pick up fish. Third, there seems to be a very different customer service mindset. They were literally just sitting around until we showed up. And we were bounced from door to door to door, whereby no one seemed to know where we would get helped.  It used to be that well-informed and hard-working employees were around everywhere and taking care of a myriad of tasks.  Such a shame to see the decline at this once great place. //Very well run, professional company that will process your seafood. Whether you want just partial processing or full processing, packing and shipping, they are well set up to handle it. Our refrigerator is out so we need flash freezing.

The were unprofessional and couldn't have been more rude towards my wife telling her if she couldn't breastfeed then she was failing our child. We were discharged on a Thursday with no real tips on how to get our son to latch, just if we didn't we were bad parents. The first night he wouldn't eat anything. We went to our pediatric doctor Friday morning concerned for his wellbeing. He has lost 18% of his birthweight. We got on a program as described by our doctor, and their lactation consultant, by his Monday morning check up he had gained the 18% back and more.

There was a sign saying gate hours and sorry for the inconvenience. Let me tell you, I was pretty irate.  Luckily I found a way in or I would have rammed the gate. Not one phone call or notice about the change in advance. Unacceptable for a business to not do due diligence to notify customers.

The museum hosts a small collection of alsakan history items, such as the cessation decree and h check used to pay for the state.  There is also a great deal of items from the different native Alaskan tribes.  If one isn't familiar, the local population aren't called 'eskimo'.  There are about a dozen or so different tribes that constitute the native inhabitants, and this museum has many displays of their traditions. If you have kids, and it's a rainy day, this is a good place to take them to keep them occupied.  The Discovery center has a play area and a decent-sized hands-on play area, which can easily lead to hours of entertainment.  A ship, an Alaskan sea-life viewing tank (complete with live king crab) are here.

12125,"V's Cellar Door was chosen by my out of town guests and I because of its clearly marked menu of Gluten Free items. 2 tables were filled with patrons who were eating when we arrived with 5 tables that quickly filled up shortly after our own arrival at 8 p.m. There were 2 waitresses and 1 out of the 2 showed inexperience; fortunately, for guests and staff alike, the more experienced of the 2 helped as much as she could and seemed to move about the room with confidence, solutions, and ease.

The kitchen was in transition. A newish chef was the one preparing everyone's meals while simultaneously training an additional chef too. Unfortunately, the waitresses failed to communicate this to us when we sat down. It would have helped to explain our long wait and eased us into our dining experience, with proper expectations in place, instead of having my guests and I wonder if we should've chosen to eat elsewhere.

On the positive side, the waitress that took our orders let us know that there was a 2 bite rule. Since the food is an infusion and a unique experience, you're able to take two bites; after which, if you don't like what you've tasted you can request the food be returned to the kitchen with no questions asked! At that point, you're able to place a new order and your bill will be adjusted to reflect the changes, i.e. You will only be charged for the menu item you actually eat/take more than a couple of bites of.

If you like spicy food, this place is for you! If you require a Gluten Free diet, V's Cellar Door has unique choices that are sure to satisfy. If you don't like spice, either think twice or request that the house sauce(s) are withheld and any other items that house a natural spice within them. Prices are moderate and well worth it for the portion size ( which is generous) as well as for the cozy, modern, yet laid-back atmosphere.

Due to our wait time (which was excessive both in regards to the initial greeting/handing out of the menu, to the taking of our order, to the wait time for our food); as well as, one of my guests utilizing the two bite give back, our waitresses approached us as a team, thanked us for not complaining but simply enjoying one another's company, thanked us for our patience, and adjusted our bill to reflect a deep discount for anything that would have reflected poorly on their establishment, on themselves, or had negatively affected our visit with them.

In the end, those involved in our first visit to V's Cellar Door did everything within their power to make things right. It's because of this, I've given a 4 star review instead of a 3. I look forward to attempting another visit in the future and to seeing notable improvements within the experience itself as I believe the staff are doing everything within their power to right their ship and succeed.

If nothing else, may curiosity and a sense of foodie adventure rule your day! Korean/Mexican fusion is cause to pause, taste, savor, and enjoy. Viva la V's Cellar Door!",Visited

Still no safe in the room.

They used to have a lot of furniture, but it kind of just looks like a used clothing store with some furniture when you walk in. I don't mean that to sound negative, it's just different than it was. I hadn't been in a long time, since before the move, and I guess I expected it to look more trendy and have more floor space. It's less flashy and the new location just isn't as appealing. The clothes are what the clothes are though. Being consignment that leaves a lot up in the air if you're looking for something specific. There isn't much appeal to male shoppers, which I suppose it pretty standard, but it would be nice if it was more than an afterthought. Overall the store is perfectly adequate, but I wouldn't say it's necessarily a standout shop to me anymore. It's indicative of the few options remaining in Juneau, Alaska.",Rumor

Said he even has some of his employed climbers out of work here and there. The next day I look on Craigslist and find an ad listing for the exact title I went in applying for posted that same day!  Basically i was told a white lie. Also during the interview the manager was asking inappropriate questions regarding my girlfriends income and work history (asking if she is on a welfare check and what agency) which had nothing to do with the position or me as a prospective employee.

13155,"I feel bad to be critical but when it comes to seafood there is a fine line between perfect and overdone. I reluctantly ordered the grilled Halibut but tried asking for the fish to be pan seared because I feel grilling is too hot and would impart a strong flavor in the delicate fish but was told no. It took 50 min for our appetizers to be delivered so they sent an extra coconut shrimp to our table. Let me say the iced tea, seafood chowder and coconut shrimp were excellent but that's where it ends. The Halibut was inedible and splintered when I cut into it with my fork. The only thing I could taste was the grill and becsuse it was so overcooked they ruined a great fish dinner. My plate arrived very sloppily put together and I was unable to eat any of it. My daughter ordered the duck but it was too undertone for my taste. I had high hopes of having great Salmon, King crab and Halibut on my trip after all Alaskans should be the best at preparing an abundantly available product but I was sadly mistaken. I ordered Halibut 5 tines and not 1 time was it prepared correctly. My daughter informed me there are the lower 48 standards and there are Alaska standards, I guess my standards are just too high because not 1 meal was excellent during my entire trip.",Visited

Born and raised here in Anchorage and this was the first time dinning here. The restaurant looks and feels like it has been there for decades with a cozy, soft, quiet, and comfortable atmosphere. The price was small compared to the portions you received. Everyone went home with a box. Parking seems a little small but I think you can park in the lot next door. We showed up without reservations but traffic was slow for a Saturday night and reservations may be a wise choice during the summer.  Will I choose to dine there in the future? Italian restaurants are a tough chew when you have a dairy allergy. Yes, some are easier to eat at than others but that is a different story. This ace deserves a once over if you have not been there.

13526,"I really hate to leave a 1 star review anywhere without trying the food, but our visit was unbelievable. We showed up just before 2pm on a Saturday. Waited for just a bit and the sushi chef (I assume) noticed us and told us to pick a seat. Followed us to insure we had menus. We were the ONLY customers there.

We sat there for 10 minutes with no waitress, which was somewhat ok because we were browsing the large sushi menu. After a bit, I stood up to see where a waitress was. Nobody around. 5 more minutes pass and I stand up again. This time a staff member sees me and starts walking our way. So I sit down. She clears the menus off the table next to us, says ""hi"", and promptly walks away. Ok.....? Maybe she is getting water? Sat there with my wife puzzled.

After 20 minutes total, no water, no waitress... nothing. Walk over to the sushi bar, where the chef and the lady are talking. They glance at me, and disappear into the kitchen. ???? At this point, my wife and I just start putting on our jackets and start walking out the door. The lady then comes over and says ""so sorry, sorry!"" I say we have just waited for 20 minutes with zero service. Bye. And walk out. TERRIBLE. How do you just ignore the only customers for over 20 minutes? Google timeline shows from parking to leaving we wasted 32 minutes here. Will not spend my money in a place that does not even try to earn my business.

13632,"Since a manager decided to never reach out to me via the email I sent, I decided to publicly post our horrible experience.

My husband and I visited Texas Roadhouse about two/three weeks back, for what was supposed to be a treat meal for us. (I’m on a restrictive diet to find an allergy and my husband is graciously suffering with me lol). we both ordered the 6 oz sirloin. Me with veggies and a plain sweet potato. And him with a ceasar salad and mashed potatoes. Our drinks were out in a timely manner, as was his salad.

But then we waited. And waited. And waited. An hour and 5 mins after originally sitting down I had a juiceless, COLD steak with no sweet potato literally dropped in front of me. The food runner never double checked that eveey thing was on the plate, or at the bare minimum acknowledged the missing side. So five minutes later when our server came by to check on us I asked about the potato. “It’ll be 5 mins.” I’m 100% convinced my sweet potato went out on one of the 10 plates of tables sat after us, but who received their food before us. Some were even larger parties, so it made zero sense. I’m super patient, rarely complain and accept sub outs without an issue when I’m kept in the loop.

But... 20 mins into waiting for this “5 min potato”, I asked her again. “We’re out for the night, it was a miscommunication between FOH and BOH”. I ordered another side of veggies, which I didn’t even want at that point and Unhappily took them home with me.

No manager ever came over to ask us how our meal went, which is why I think our ticket was lost at some point. I just... had really high hopes for this night out.

Texas Roadhouse is usually our go to place, but we’ve decided that since we’re obviously not important enough to have someone reach back out.  That we will not be patronizing anymore.",Visited

She ordered two different sets of colored contacts. One set was hazel, one was gray. They came, but the hazel sets were only for the left eye, and the gray for the other. They screwed up again!

The bathroom door was about 5 inches away from the toilet (compact bathroom entirely) The closet was just a shy smaller than the bathroom! There was a rather large desk chair and one chair with an ottoman. Not ONE was even the slightest bit comfortable! The breakfast from the Jade restaurant in the lobby was distasteful and expensive. You have to order downstairs, wait then bring the food to your room. There was no in-room service. It cost $22 to park our car in an empty lot for ONE NIGHT!

But its peacful here, me and wooly are keeping fairly warm during our camp, we try when we have to. For those of you who dont know Wooly is my Ferret and he is 4 years old :). Its not crowded at all here, no doubt cause of the salmon festival going on in ninilchick. On my way there to help get it on the map ;).
Its another great place to get away with family, friends or pets. Is fairly remote so be watchful for bears if you have open food containers. Public restrooms are cleaner than you usually find so thats good. Lots of trees, three camp areas an open play area thats fairly enclosed. Id still be vigilent about kids and pets if you have them roaming while theres not many people here. Coyotes are known to be in this area too. But their usually not a problem so enjoy yourself and come check it out one day or two or more lol. Especially in the summer. When you enter here keep to the right do not go down the left road before reading the warning marker ive posted on it! Its a fangerous road if youve never had a taste of navigating it, especially on the way back up backwards if your not gonna risk getying stuck on the beach below.

14018,"Our group of people had our choice to dine anywhere in Anchorage. We had done upscale for the previous two nights, and the suggestion was ""comfort"" food. We pulled up Yelp for suggestions. My son said "" I've heard good things about Kriners"", so we went. The parking lot looked a little unloved.
Inside, however, we were met with warmth and a friendliness that is rare anywhere. The food was brilliant. The meatloaf was not a slice; by most standards it was the entire meatloaf. The burger was so fantastic that I'm not sure what magic was performed, but I want the spell.
The service was brilliant. Heather was honestly engaging and made us feel like the most important customers in the world. Super professional, too! She knew each item by number and verified the components back to each person-- impressive!
There should be a big sign on the outside which says: Where Locals Eat
I'm hypothesizing, but I'd recon that most everyone who eats here has wonderful thoughts of Kriners.",Visited

14054,"I needed coolant for my Polaris ATV and some Stihl equipment. I went to purchase a $720 backpack fogger (SR 450), $650 backpack blower (BR 800 C-E) and a $650 FS240 trimmer for my business. I spent about 5 minutes waiting for somebody in sales to come help, which they didn't. The Stihl ""desk"" was unoccupied, but there were numerous sales folks walking around waxing motorcycles or playing on their phones. I then went and pulled down the FS 240, put the harness on, adjusted it, made more adjustments, attached the trimmer, and walked around to see how the weight was distributed and how comfortable it was. In hindsight, I probably should have swung it around the motorcycles that may have got their attention. At this point, I started to really notice how little they cared about the Stihl brand within their store as 2 other sets of people had come and gone by the time I had danced around with the trimmer and accessories. I had spent almost 20 minutes in the store, looking at the equipment that I wanted to purchase (They didn't have a backpack fogger). I then grabbed the coolant and went to the parts counter and paid.  During the transaction, I was asked ""Did you find everything you needed?"" I replied that I had spent far too much time waiting for somebody to assist me, so I was going to go else ware. The counter guy offered to see if he could find somebody, to which I declined. I have been disappointed by the Outpost, and have used the dealership in Delta as the only place I will purchase Polaris vehicles from in Interior Alaska. I only went to the Outpost because I needed coolant AND Stihl equipment. They had both.  I was told by the parts guy that the Stihl ""salesman"" actually works at Fort Knox Gold mine, this was a ""part time"" job for him when he wanted to come in, and that he didn't know much about the equipment anyway.
The Outpost touts themselves as the farthest north blankity-blank dealership in America. But, that is the only thing they have going for them. I have never been impressed with their customer service or their service department. (I spent almost $350 for them to tell me my fuel pump was bad, diagnosis only, no repair). I have purchased Stihl and Honda small engine equipment (Chainsaw and Generator), but that was because I was new in town and was willing to accept sub-par customer service as the norm. But, after being here in Fairbanks for 10 years, I've learned that sometimes the little shops are the ones that shine, the glitzy dealership on the highway is based solely on their exclusivity of some brands. The equipment I need to pay the bill is available elsewhere, and most all manufactures offer ""Nationwide pricing"" so, going someplace with big windows and shiny motorcycles isn't going to save you any money. Go to the little guys. As far as weekend toys, I have NEVER been disappointed by going to Delta (I live in North Pole, so it doesn't seem THAT far to save a thousand or so dollars vs. these guys).

I know this was long, but after 10 years of not having anything positive to say about the Outpost, I feel I have the clout to post a long winded and factual track record experience with the Outpost. I fully expect to see a reply from their ""customer service rep"" stating ""We are sorry for bla-bla-bla, we pride ourselves in bla-bla-bla"". Well Outpost, after 10 years of sub-par customer service, I can fully feel justified in saying, Fairbanks is known for its sub-par customer service, but you get first place for poor customer service. (We are sort of an island here in Fairbanks, Sub-par seems standard in Fairbanks...) The Outpost only has their exclusive brands that carry the weight and ""force"" that brand of customer to go there.  I'll visit for fluids, order my hard-parts from online Polaris dealers, purchase my Honda small engine from either the Wood Way (I have some opinions about them), Sportsman's Warehouse (Generators and their Military discounts!) or Craig Taylor for Honda small engine and Stihl equipment.",Visited

14329,"Came in today, ordered food for the family and apps, all that came out fine. I asked for a Calzone, no red sauce and for my toppings, extra ricotta and mushrooms. Got an almost burnt calzone full of only ricotta and diced mushrooms, was disgusting. It's covid gave the staff the benefit of the doubt, waited 20 minutes for the white chick with dreadlocks to return to check on us, she didnt, had to flag her down. Explained the problem, she seemed confused, argued with me, I told her that her tone was rude and she walked BACK to the table to ARGUE with me. She came back from the kitchen and admitted it was a mistake. I had to work, lunch ruined, asked her to remove it, paid my check and left. This is the second time my calzone was ruined. First time I asked for extra mushrooms and mozzarella, and ended up with a giant bread pocket full of uncooked mushrooms. A calzone is not a complicated dish. Pizza dough folded over with or without red sauce and toppings, mozzarella and ricotta. The last time the waitress was amazing and immediately empathized with me and got it fixed. This lady refused to admit she made a mistake, and didn't even mention the lack of mozarella until I mentioned it, and continued to argue. She came back with the check and blamed it on the kitchen, which is shameful because the kitchen obviously made our clams, my wife and kids food just fine, dont drag them into the dirt because of your lack of willingness to just admit a mistake. I'm a vet, and I've worked in the hospitality business, I tip 20% by default unless there is a reason to not, and I always give plenty of empathy and understanding but this woman's unwillingness to just say ""im sorry, ill get it fixed, would you like it remade or taken off your check"" until I asked for it is inexcusable. I've had great experiences at this location but with two failed calzones and this time a service issue, I cant really say I have a reason to come back. Theres tons of amazing pizza in Anchorage and the valley. I had no complaints about anything other than the way she handled my issue. If a customer has a complaint, just apologize and get it fixed, I didn't personally attack her or assign blame to anyone from the start  I just explained my issue and asked for it to be resolved.

14512,"Pay twice as much?  Dimond Blvd Costco is the store where you pay a premium above the price stated.  In some cases, you get to pay twice as much!  Want whiny and condescending service from the wireless counter? Come to Dimond Blvd Costco.

Usually I am a Costco fan and advocate.  Yesterday was not a good day for the Dimond Blvd. location.  They double charged me for a vacuum, and supposedly credited my account.  It was done on purpose when I wasn't looking.  The only way it gets scanned when it's on the bottom of your cart, is on purpose, and the cashier/checker scanned it purposefully, twice.  I thought the $600 shopping bill was a bit steep at first, but chalked it off to Costco pricing.  Now I know they are double charging for single item purchases.

Then guess what?  The full charge shows up in my credit card account, but not the credit.  The credit is not even PENDING!?!?!   I'll give it another day because it's a holiday, but this is fraud if it's not corrected.

The guy working in the wireless counter has no customer service skills.  If you want snide remarks to simple questions, then the guy is perfect.  If you have a question about any part of the plans?  The guy makes sure that your question is one your are already supposed to know the answer too with his condescending attitude.  The guy's name started with a J and he's kind of big with an ethnic background.  I glanced at his name tag and happily forgot his name; not to mention they lost a customer before I even had a chance to make a cell phone and service plan purchase inquiry.

This is not the service I expect from Costco.",Visited

She also uses very high quality products and brushes and the application stays in place until the very end of the night. (or if you fall asleep with it on on your wedding night you wake up looking like a goddess) haha

14815,"I adopted my kitten from these guys and he has been a complete joy. He is leash trained and social--  he doesn't bark-- but he acts like a dog, he rolls around and flops on your feet. It's pretty funny. He can't land his jumps well and is a bit clumsy and camera shy. Through a 4,300+ mile road trip, he only freaked out once. And that was when we would open the windows to pay tolls.

Our adoption fee was $145. This came with his vaccination and a chip. He is not declawed, and he doesn't tear up furniture anyways and to be honest-- ear clipping and declawing are animal cruelty.

Adopting a pet is a terrific thing to do, you can change an animal's life and their stress levels in the blink of an eye. When we adopted him, he was a lil' dirty and wasn't taking care of himself. We bought a foam bath product intended for cats and have pretty much spoiled him with toys.

The caretakers there had told us that he was timid natured and probably wouldn't be ok around kids or guests and that he might be shy. He was that way the first two days we had him-- but a laser pointer snapped him right out of it. We used the pointer and snacks to leash train him.

If you adopt a cat, I recommend Science Diet (balanced nutrition) or Blue Buffalo (higher protein) cat food. The Tidy Cats pellet system works like magic. Better than clay or pine litter.

Best Thai food I have ever had though is Thai Esan in Springlake North Carolina.

There was no pressure to buy or anything like that. He helped us stay within our budget. He was able to print off quotes and drawings for us at our first visit. We took home the drawings to make sure the equipment would fit in the space that we wanted to put them. We went back the next day to make a purchase. We ended up with a nice treadmill and the M2 multigym. They even sell foam floor squares for your to put your new equipment on. I'm looking forward to our delivery date!

She the called the facility to ask if they could find a way to get someone to move so she could get out. They said they were unwilling to help and that she should “just go in reverse” or wait until 230 am or if someone moved.

I called the facility to see if we could get it taken care of. Spoke to young female who said that was the case and that she would send me to a manager. I then told the manager the exact same story and she handed the phone to the head of security. I then asked the head of security if I needed to explain the situation for a third time, he said yes since he was just given the phone. After telling him the situation he abruptly hung up because he had to catch a flight. I called the facility back and said I didn’t appreciate being hung up on, she said a fight hard started in the facility which led him to hang up the phone.

Clearly not the greatest service, Also probably not great that a fight occurred at the facility.",Visited

The only issues I had where 1) the advertised free breakfast but the three days I was there, there was no breakfast only coffee to drink. The front desk lady said their shipment didn't come in. That was on the first day. I'm assuming it didn't come in the next two days either, since they didn't offer breakfast. 2) I couldn't reach the front desk via the phone in the room. When I pushed the front desk button, it was always busy. The times I had to get ahold of the front desk, I had to use my cell phone and call the local hotel number and press the button indicated to reach the front desk. 3) the room came with no towels. When I caught up with housekeeping in the morning, the woman would only give me one towel. So, other then those annoyances, the room was awesome. Way worth the $150+taxes I spent for the three nights.  I will book with them again, hoping they have breakfast to offer or remove it from their hotel description.",Rumor

As another table gets seated, they were served within minutes of ordering while my family and I still hadn't gotten our orders, or refills on drinks, we decided to leave but not before complaining to the waitress.

15612,"So this is an interesting place to get pizza, right on the eastern edge of Denali national park (for those of you that still think or say ""Mckinley"", you're way behind the times).  Anyeay, the locale is cool, right next to a vicious creek.  Theres a horseshoe pit and cornhole lane in the front.  Plenty of space outside for you to get ravaged by mosquitos, so bring bug spray.  The views of the m li mountains are awesome.  Inside it's a quaint place, where strange but friendly locals hang out.  The pizza itself, for anyone from places where real pizza is made like the upper east coast, is a bit disappointing.  The sauce is really sweet for starters.  The crust is ok for a pie made outside of the tri-state area, and the toppings seem fresh.  But the flavor is just not what I'm used to eating.  Its wasn't bad, but it's nothing that I'd rave about.  I visited during the whole COVID pandemic, and social distancing or mask-wearing was not an issue nor was it enforced or respected.  All in all, I would not go out of my way to eat her again, I may never eat her again period, but at least I can say I tried it.

15756,"Lahn Pad Thai has some of the best Thai cuisine I have had.  There are many choices on the menu, and if you have a special plate in mind, they have many off menu specialties as well.  If you are new to Thai cuisine or have friends or family that isn't wild about it; there are many choices as well. My favorite dish is Pork Panang.  This is a spicy dish. A great way to manage the level of heat is to order mild or medium with chili mix on the side.  You can ramp it up slowly, and you have control.  Panang can be pork, chicken or beef.  The sauce has body and tange with highlights of coconut and the heat of the chilies. Thai basil also rounds out the freshness of the dish.  A great side beverage is Thai Ice tea.  There are spices and sweetness along with cream.  The cream can also help control the burn of the chilies if the heat builds up too much.
As for atmosphere, the restaurant is on the smaller side. This feels cozy and comfortable to me.  It is common to see patrons individually, as couples or groups of four.  I have seen a party of ten, but they arrived early and were lucky to be seated together.  Delivery isn't offered, but phone orders and pickup are common.  This is a family run business and its evident that they love what they do.  Give it a chance, you'll be glad you did.",Rumor

Erik is the manager, Jaseon and Brian are estimators, Christy and Flo at the front desk and Tim who performed all the body work. I have to mention the diesel mechanic who handled the powertrain transfer, unfortunately I don't know his name and did not personally meet him.

We got a quote to pack our things and when the packing people came out who also were going to move it to storage came out they DOUBLED the quote given and even forgot the storage that was included in the quote and stuff in the apartment so they had to be called back out and we were CHARGED FOR THAT! Our things were stored and when we pulled the trigger on the shipping to Texas 2 entertainment centers were broken, a dresser was broken, a lot of scratches on things, our mattress covers (very expensive bought at the mattress store with the mattresses) were torn. Stuff for the bedroom was in with kitchen dishes and game consoles had water in them. No moving crew showed up to unload the truck. It's been a mess and a hassle.

Side note: Wally was AWESOME!!!!!!!

Just a response to the comment made below. It was NOT our idea to offload the truck ourselves but we had no other alternative considering we live on a small residential street. Yes you are responsible for the other businesses when you are charging on your end for their service. It is your companies reputation on the line. YOU did not pay us Wally did and we weren't satisfied with that and that wasn't our idea either. It was growing late and we had no alternatives but to do it. Now while unpacking we are finding bedroom stuff in with the kitchen stuff, kitchen stuff in with the bathroom stuff. This has been a very unorganized and unprofessional move from the estimate that was not honored to our broken things. A dresser we had to replace, we had water in our 2 playstations and xbox 360. It's ridiculous and you just try to smooth it over by saying we got paid, it was our idea and we were happy about it? NO WAY!)",Visited

She then takes the item to register 6 and I wait in line behind people that have an item with a partial tag and need to verify it. The checkout lady could have checked me thru while we waited several minutes to have a gentleman come out and verify the item. #2 As I'm in line the lady who originally got the item for me looks at me with a confused face, I tell her I was paying cash and she said come with me. Pulled me out of line to take me to a register thats closed and was not operational. No offense I've had enough. 40 mind for something I had in my hand in 10 is ridiculous. I was better off just going to the Abbott store, in and out in 10-15 minutes. Stellar service over there, Tudor not so much. Which is a big bummer because that's the big store with the inventory.

Except for only two machines, everything was operational, and in great condition.

The building was clean and appealing, and provided plenty of spaces for action, some quiet, and even a cocktail in the upper level Sky Lounge (elevator accessible).

Their pricing is a tad on the expensive side, (Sky Lounge beverages were reasonable) and the reason for only four stars (I'd rate them 4.5 stars for this if I could).

I recommend planning at least three hours to experience all of the premium attractions (the XD was my favorite) when they are busy. Maximum occupancy is 900 persons.

Rolling their eyes dramatically when a customer didn't understand their mumbled question, acting exasperated that a customer dare to ask a question, general grumpiness at having to work for a living. In the evenings there are never enough registers open,  and you have to wait a long time in line. I have been sixth in line many a time. We have stopped making quick trips there in the evenings because of this issue. So when you wait that long and your cashier is rude, it really makes you resent having supported their business.",Visited

16282,"Here's why I'm rating them as three stars-customer service.  As any small business, you want to make your customers feel welcome.  Be appreciative of their patronage.  That doesn't happen here.  Now, they do have a selection most parts necessary.  I never had any service done here because they are too expensive and most of the issues I've had with my RV, I fix myself.  But when I walk in to buy a part and the woman and man at counter look at me and don't even say ""hello"", it sets that tone that they don't care that you're there.  Sadly, in Fairbanks, you have two choices for RV parts and service.  Alaska RV center has a worse attitude than Arctic RV, the lady on the phone is always impatient, not friendly, and most importantly, not helpful. This place shares the same traits only to a lesser degree.  When there's more competition, businesses will probably be more in tune with the customer service experience.  But since you only have these two choices in Fairbanks, you're at their mercy.  If I need a part in a pinch, I'll head here and get it.  If I can get it off Amazon and it's not a rush, that's usually where I go. Like I said, selection is good, most prices are fair but their customer service sucks.  A simple ""hello"" would make that so much better.",Visited

The chicken salad pretzel sandwich was terrible. Had mayo smeared across the top (for ""presentation,"" maybe?) so you couldn't pick it up without getting your hands all goopy. The chicken salad inside was just chunks of flavorless chicken mixed with tons more mayo. Not good at all. Our beers tasted a bit off, like the tap lines were skunked.

The kids' menu burger was actually pretty good though (much larger than most), as was the pretzel beef & cheddar sandwich. Service was great. But overall, it was just Sysco pre-fab stuff, nothing special. Recommend skipping it.",Visited

I would've preferred the hanging menus in the restaurant were a bit more descriptive - it's very cut-and-dry - but it'd be nice to see how much it costs to add Fajita Veggies, or how much Queso is when added to bowl.

Not taking away a star for that - because that's corporate, and they don't care about these reviews lol.

On top of that, there was always someone nearby if I needed help, and at least once or twice somebody specifically came over just to see if they could help.

16588,"We live out in the Alaskan Bush, with no vet for 400 miles. When our dog started peeing blood and throwing up, we sought out a recommendation from our local dog rescue who pointed us to Midnight Sun. She is a very large pup (125lbs and lanky), and hates being away from her people, so I was nervous about shipping her out without us. From the moment she arrived at Midnight Sun, they were kind and communicative. They let me know when she arrived, and the vet herself (not a vet tech or receptionist, which is often the case) called to discuss her care, asking permission prior to performing X-rays, and patiently answering my questions even though it was late in the evening.  I am also in the medical field, which I did not disclose to her doctor at that time, and I was very impressed with how through she was, and how she spoke to me. She clearly is an animal lover and not just there for the income. I believe it was Doctor Hefley that I spoke with, but I'm not positive as it was late and I was exhausted. Luna had to spend the night due to flight times, and was to fly out the following day, but an incompetent courier service resulted in a second overnight stay. At this point I was really anxious to get my pup home, and I was delighted when one of the employees, Darby, called and asked if I would like pictures of Luna to settle my mind. Obviously I said yes. She was not in a crate, but a playpen with toys, getting attention from staff (I will say, she is a pro at getting attention ;) )

In regards to the cost of treatment: Yes, it's expensive. However, $200 for an X-ray is pretty standard at a vet. Vet fees vary for an office visit, but this is an emergency vet, so just like an ER visit for people, you have to assume a higher exam cost. This is not a lot cost clinic, however in being a pet owner, one must understand that there might be an emergency.  And unlike other vets that we have been to, we were not charged for repeat x-rays that they did to ""double check"" their own work the following morning.  Being a pet owner in a place that requires a flight and a courier to get my pup to the vet, I'm grateful that a place like Midnight Sun is there to treat her with compassion.",Visited

16643,"Horrible experience at this lot. First day was good. Wife and I got there shortly before close and talked to a really nice salesman. Told him we were interested in a truck they had and we would be back tomorrow to see if we could make a deal. Came back the next day with my own approved financing through navy federal and my 2013 Dodge Durango with 50k miles. Books in good condition trade in at around 18k and I only owed 6k.  They waste about an hour of my time doing an appraisal and come back inside and say ""well the good news is you have a couple grand in equity"". I thought he was saying it sarcastically but he sat down and proceeded to tell me my car was only worth 8k because it was hard to sell. I knew I would take a hit from blue book value but 10k less come on that's just trying to rip someone off. I went down to affordable used cars an hour later and got 15k on my trade. The manager or owner I guess got wind of us walking out and called my wife the next day and apologized and asked if we would come back down to work something out. So I appreciated him trying to make it right just just be careful who you deal with down there. Seems like they are just waiting for someone who is impatient or just not very savvy to take advantage of.",Visited

16846,"I was looking into buying a Jeep Wrangler from there recently, and I must say that the experience as a whole was a complete disgrace. There was one guy I was working with - a new employee - who was kind and helpful (really nice dude), but everyone else there seemed like they were trying to scam you and escape with your money. Their tone was hostile and abrupt, and they did not like to negotiate prices whatsoever. Granted, the price of the vehicle was $3k under booking (I wonder why that is?) and they said I was getting a ""deal,"" but it made me skeptical. Come to find out, the car had multiple cosmetic issues that they refused to replace before purchasing, saying they were ""selling it as is."" The engine compartment was dirty, rust on the block, and inside of the car was not detailed whatsoever. When I brought up all these issues to the manager there, we ended up getting in a heated yelling argument before I left the establishment with no plans to ever return.

A friend tried purchasing a car from here as well with similar reviews and complaints. I urge whoever is reading this to NEVER set foot in this car dealership. EVER.

[As a side note, I just purchased a car from Affordable Used Cars, and I had the exact opposite experience. They were kind, not pushy, and offered to work with my price range. They even let me test drive the car without a worry in the world. The car was spotless, and everything checked out. Looks like RWB lost a sale due to s****y Customer Service.] /rant",Visited

The service was great, I must mention, this may not be somewhere you necessarily want to bring children. There's no kids menu, and generally the ambiance is geared more towards college age and up, my opinion, but just an fyi.

The workers were so friendly helpful patient and understanding. It’s well worth coming in and looking through. They have great quality in the selection of goodies and they have two floors and an elevator too if needed. The store is decorated with hanging planes in honor of Ron Bailey owning and flying his own planes, and he also collects Cookie Jars which are along all the walls in the store they are so beautiful and I posted a few pictures of them below.

16898,"Having recently moved to anchorage from the lower 48 i was looking forward to building a relationship with the local toyota dealership like i had before. I will be taking my business elsewhere, the first time i needed work done they let me down. A few days ago my blower motor started to chirp under my dash so i called the service department to get an appointment scheduled and was informed that not only did they not have a blower motor, it was going to take 2 weeks to arrive and cost $250, also they wouldn't be able to get me an appointment for 3 weeks and that was going to cost another $230. So I decided to look around and found the part at auto zone for $65 and a 5 minute youtube video showed me how easy it would be. So I took on the task, I am fairly mechanically inclined, and was able to remove and replace the blower motor in around 25 minutes with the flashlight on my phone and my leatherman screwdriver. The fact that anyone would charge $250 for a part that is readily accessible for under $70 is insulting and that they would then charge $230 for 25 minutes of work that can be done by an untrained person with a Phillips screwdriver is downright disrespectful. If i could they would be getting zero stars and i will never be returning to there parking lot",Visited

The place is really for travelers and older wealthy float pilots picking up on young servers.  Occasionally you get the folks off the street on spenard coming in drunk.  Most of the people eating at the bar are tourist just eating and drinking there.   The bar is extremely huge (it's connected to the restaurant part).

Rest rooms are available, as well as a pavilion with picnic tables, which we have used countless times. There's a field large enough for soccer and other games, and a small playground area with swings. The beach is sandy, but watch your feet! Alas, dog owners are not consistently respectful about cleaning up after their pets! There are several geocaches within convenient walking distances, and ski trails through the woods.

17043,"(Translated by Google) Chena Hot Springs is famous for its hot springs and is also a resort that provides accommodation. NorthPole is located on the south side of Fairbanks, 60 miles from the airport and about an hour and a half on snowy road. This one-hundred-year-old Chena Hot Springs was built by a pair of brothers who dig out a gold mine. The reason why the two brothers discovered this hot spring was to help his brother Robert, who suffers from rheumatism, find a place to soothe the pain. They finally found this hot spring in the barren land of inland Alaska and built 12 cabins to entertain guests from all over the world, and it became one of the most popular resorts in inland Alaska.
The American Agricultural Service once sent people to analyze the hot spring water here and found that the water quality here is very different from the water in other parts of the United States, which has special benefits for the human body. Soaking in the hot spring here, you can feel the temperature difference between 30 degrees in the hot spring and minus 30 degrees and up to 60 degrees outside the hot spring.

In a light-free environment, Chena Hot Springs has become a good place for chasing aurora. If you are lucky, you can see the beautiful scenery in the picture outside the cabin.

Friends who want to live here can book here in advance. In addition to the hot springs, there is also the famous Aurora Ice Museum to visit, all of which are made of ice, just like the palace of Elsa in Frozen. The ice sculptures inside are exceptionally novel and dreamy under the light, and there is also an Ice Bar. Don’t forget to order a glass of ""Appletini"" made of Vodka and apple juice and placed in an ice goblet to warm up!

Chena Hot Springs 以温泉著名，也是一个提供住宿的度假村。位于 Fairbanks 南边的北极村 (NorthPole)，距离机场 60英里，开雪路约一个半小时。这个一百多年历史的 Chena Hot Springs 是由一对掏金矿的兄弟一手打造。两兄弟之所以发掘这片温泉，是为了帮患有风湿的哥哥 Robert 找到一个可以安抚疼痛的地方。他们最后在这个阿拉斯加内陆贫瘠的地找到这座温泉并打造了12个小木屋招待千里迢迢来这的客人，应而变成阿拉斯加内陆其中一个最热门的度假村。
美国农务所曾派人来分析这里温泉的水，发现这边的水质跟美国其他地方的水十分不一样对人体有特别的益处。在这里泡温泉，你可以感受到泡在温泉中30度及温泉外零下30度高达60度的温差。

无光害的环境，Chena Hot Springs 成为了适合追极光的好地方。幸运的话在小木屋外就可以看到图片中的美景。

想住这的朋友可提前网上预定点这里，除了温泉这里亦有著名 Aurora Ice Museum 可参观，这里全部都是冰做的，仿佛冰雪奇缘中 Elsa 的皇宫般。里头的冰雕在灯光照射下格外新奇梦幻，还有一座 Ice Bar 冰冻酒吧，别忘了点上一杯以 Vodka 和苹果汁调制而成，且装在冰制高脚杯的“Appletini""暖暖身！",Visited

When you take into consideration, other fast food hamburger joints, have patties that look like a semi rolled back and forth over it,Arby's packed the meat on and for a decent price. Very pleased overall. Arby's,they have the meats!Thanks!!",Visited

17078,"While Tycho likes a good brush and towel down (aka turbo pets), bathing and nail trimming have always been a nightmare. Particularly nail trimming, which at home is a 4 person job where you can hear this dog sobbing like a literal human infant before so much as an air current touches his little dainties. Imagine my delight and surprise when Poshy Paws managed to soothe the corgi beast and get him freshened up and sparkling with hardly a snarl or two (trust me that's really good for him). They even gave him a little tie so he'd be at his most dapper. With a clean, cheerful facility, warm & patient groomers, and a handsome puppy, I'm so happy I went to Poshy Paws!",Rumor

17083,"Very nice and professional people at this business.  I am thoroughly satisfied with my security system and remote start that they installed on my Ram. They walked me through the features of the remote start and the security system and made sure I felt comfortable with the system before I departed. Gotta say that when I need a security/autostart in the future, on my next vehicles, I will certainly be going to Shades of Competition. Highly recommend! 10/10 Thank you guys.
Edited on 07/18/18: Very thorough with products and install of devices.  I called them and made an appointment for a smartstart for my truck.  It was done in less than 45 minutes.  Very knowledgeable.  Great products.  Great and passionate staff. Still a 10/10 experience.",Visited

17099,"Best meal we’ve probably ever had in Alaska. Salmon and the entree salad were out of this world. Deserts to die for, all freshly prepared on premise. Incredible dining vibe and still packed at 8:30PM, although we got our table in under 30 minutes without a reservation. So worth the short drive out of town of Denali (we even saw a moose at the side of the road, and on the way back, we witnessed a black bear dart safely across the Denali Highway). This place very much earns its #2 rating on TripAdvisor.",Rumor
17100,"I like the lower ticket prices for second run movies that I haven't seen anyway.  The last time we visited one restroom was closed and the other one could have used a good cleaning.  Otherwise, I would still return if they had a movie I wanted to see.",Visited

I ripped the pocket on my pants and brought them to Alaska Cleaner to fix. I got them back to find out that they used blue thread on black pants. The second time I brought my coat that needed hemming. Pockets and sleeves were unthreading. Took a month for them to fix and the repairs lasted only a month.",Visited
