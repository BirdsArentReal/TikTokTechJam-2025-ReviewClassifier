69,"For starters, it‚Äôs good to know that not everybody has had a bad experience with OPA. Dr. Kornmesser and Dr. Taylor were extremely understanding and helpful in making progress in my case.  Unfortunately that is where the fine care ends.

I have been trying to get treatment for my cervical and lumbar spine since May with OPA.  Overall this has been a 2 year ordeal for me. I have seen 4 separate providers in 5 appointments with OPA, with a 5 week break without any treatment due to an administrative faux pas.  A cervical MRI that was taken in February wasn‚Äôt looked at by a Doctor until late July.  That was Dr. Taylor.  I was finally seen by PA Glen, in September.  This was an appointment that I had waited months for.  PA Glen ordered a MRI of my lumbar, although he thought that it was nothing more than a back strain. The MRI was taken and I was given an appointment at 3:30 pm on
Friday October 13th, with PA Glen.  I arrived at my appointment at about 2:40.  If your not early, you‚Äôre late..  Although I understand that it was busy earlier, the waiting room had very few people.  Those that were already there were brought back to their appointments and arriving patients did not wait long to be seen.  At 4pm, there were just a couple of new arrivals and myself in the waiting room.  I went to check out.  The intake clerk wasn‚Äôt aware that the spinal clinic was running behind.  She called back to check on their status and nobody was there to answer the phone. That leaves me to strongly suspect that the spinal clinic closed down and went home.  I signed out and left.

I received a call at at 9:30 am on Monday October 16, from a young lady with great apologies.  The spine clinic was just so busy!  I was informed that there were a lot of people that need to be seen.  I understood, because I am one of them!  I was told that PA Glen couldn‚Äôt see me until Friday and that he was the only person that can read my MRI.  I informed her that was unacceptable and requested to be seen by either Dr. Eule or Dr. Taylor.  I was told that neither are here, and the only provider is PA Glen.  That to me is unacceptable.

From the information that I‚Äôve been given, it appears that PA Glen is running the spine clinic all by himself, and he only take appointments on Tuesdays and Fridays.  So far my experience has been like a game of kick the can, or in this case kick the patient.  I need to be treated and OPA has given me no choice but to seek treatment from another provider.  Based on my experience, I would tell anybody that would listen to stay clear of OPA.  The patient only equals billing hours!",Advertisement,Legitimate
70,"Ambiance is great.  The place is a wooden establishment and has a scent of firewood, which I loved! The place cooks some of their food over a wood fire, which is SO AWESOME! My boyfriend and I loved watching the different foods cook.

Anyway, we were so full from our breakfast that we wanted to just get drinks so that's what we did.  We had the oatmeal stout, raspberry wheat, mai tai, peach mojito, summer sangria, and sweet tea all were soooo delicious! Also, saw on the menu that on Tuesday's you can fill a growler for $5, such an awesome deal!

I understand that they wanted to get out of there etc however the lady that helped me was very obviously in too much of a rush. No, I didn't go right when they were going to close or even within an hour before. All she had to do was turn a new phone on for me. She actually said ""can you just do the Google part yourself when you leave? I don't feel like messing with it"". Well, to make sure that my contacts etc went thru and that everything worked right, you kind of have to do it when you buy the phone if you use Google/gmail, which I do. I know she was probably tired from christmas shopping etc but at the same time, I could have gone elsewhere to buy a phone. I could have gone and just gotten one of those ones from Wal-Mart. I chose to go thru this company, I waited at least 30 mins, I was also in a hurry and had tons of things to do yet the difference is, I wasn't rushing her or making her feel as tho she were bothering me.

Some of our food (Such as the Scallop soup) was some of the best I have ever had. Our cheese selection was lacking and our entrees were sub par. They called my steak American Wagyu but it was touch and chewy. My wife ordered the pork chop and our server warned us that it might come out as *medium* which my wife would have been happy with. The chop came out overcooked and tough. Both of our sides were lackluster as well.

Of course the mountain, Denali, along with the abundance of wildlife, are the reasons many people are sure to include the park in their travel plans when visiting. For me though, I‚Äôve come to appreciate the small rocks, abundance of mushrooms and wildflowers, the paths to creek beds and rivers and the sunrises and sunsets. While the Visitor Center and park services are open from mid-May to mid-September only the park remains open to a certain point for skiing and winter hiking...perhaps mushing as well (though you will want to check). I have it on good authority that March is an excellent time to visit is you are Aurora hunting. There is also a Winter Festival each year. In the summer season the area is hospitable to campers, hikers or those who want to bus in. There are several bus options. Cars/RV‚Äôs aren‚Äôt allowed past a certain portion of the road. The only exception to that is the annual lottery open to Alaska residents. Winners are able to drive the road with their own vehicles.

I had a Rueben and soup, both were very good. The corned beef was soft, and the texture was amazing. The bread was perfectly toasted. The sauerkraut did not distract from the sandwich and had been portioned perfectly.
The soup had a nice creamy base, the dumplings were soft, and everything was small to accommodate all customers. Very thoughtful and safe.
The chai was pleasantly foamed, i did not expect this. I believe it was a modified Oregon chai. Again,  modified to stand out, but still near enough to the original to be familiar.
The fries were the most surprising to me. I'm not a fry guy yet these made me stop and admire them.

947,"The rooms and staff were very nice, but the main reason we rented here was to use the pool and hot tub. The pool was ok, but the hot tub had visible slim/mold caked on every corner. I was disgusted and we didn't go back in the pool area at all after that im pretty bummed me spent over 300 dollars for our stay and didn't get to enjoy the pool area. My son had alot of fun in the jacuzzi in our room.
I did notify the staff about the situation and I got fed a bunch or excuses. So I checked online reviews other than mine, and this issue was brought to the attention of the hotel staff 2 weeks ago but is still not been resolved.
I will not be staying here for future special events. I am a local and because my birthday is during the cold season we usually rent a room somewhere around town.
I understand pool and hot tubs are expensive to maintain but the water shouldn't taste like salt or hurt eyes when you come back up from swimming under water. Lastly when I asked later on about the pool being cleaned the women at the front desk told me ""I sent the maintenance guy to wipe that off the walls."" Only to wipe it off the walls not to actually clean it. I lived in the lower 48 for years and rented hotels down there. Even the cheapest motel/hotel hot tubs are better kept than this one.

Update: The general manager is no help at all!! I called to get a refund and they said they would give me money back for one day I was ok with that, until I looked at my bank account and noticed the hotel took out another 155 dollars. I called to have it corrected and the manager told me to quit yelling even though I was not. I have a clear speaking voice and was upset, but I didn't yell so of course it made me get upset when he kept being unreasonable.
He automatically got an attitude with me and was absolutely no help and was acting very petty and snippy. It's like he was trying to have a pissing contest when I just wanted my money back the hotel wrongfully took from my account.

I feel like this company specifically targeted me because I wrote a bad review and wanted a refund. I will never stay at a Hampton in ever again due to the unprofessional actions of the general manager.

He definitely needs more training on how to handle high stress situations with customers.
He kept interrupting me to give me excuses in the middle of my complaint rather than actually trying to solve the situation, and kept telling me to call their 1800 number because he couldn't help me if I didn't want help.
Then he had the audacity to laugh at my situation like it was funny that I couldn't buy food for my familt due to his employees mistake.
I called multiple times throughout the day to try and have this issue resolved and the manager never called me back or spoke to me himself until they processed the money out of my account. He had his assistant manager do it.

When I first called to let corrin know they took money out rather then putting it back in specifically requested to speak with their accounting department or the manager. She told me she would handle it and it was not handled.

I may sound lie a bro ken record, but I do not want other people to have this issue happen to them either so I am filing a report with corporate.

Corrin was helpful it was the general manager who was no help and just down right rude. I called to be helped not get into a pissing contest with the person who was supposed to be in charge.",Legitimate,Legitimate

he went and verified my price and said it was in the wrong place.

I really really wanted them so , sure I was willing to spend more. though  I said it was the stores error and they should honor the price posted with the pair I wanted.  the customers was right and  when I worked retail years ago ,they were right and we honored it.  I noticed the iridescent logo of the shoe was scratched. there is not a way to fix a thick scratch so he got the pair at the very top and the fabric was fraying like it got caught on something a small tear. so I mentioned a possible discount for a damaged item. he said they cant honor the 49.99 nor discount the shoe. ugh I was upset at this point. the other location was closed and I went with a similar shoe and guess what. not in stock and he was getting frustrated and the other gal as I was asking for too much.i just bought my babys shoes and didnt bother getting anything else for their bogo sale.

1164,"The two new sculptured panels have the theme ""Given...by the Great Land"". These are solemn artworks which flank the USA flagpole and the memorials to the Alaskan military who have paid the ultimate price in their service to the country.

The North Panel. ‚ÄúReflections on the Great One‚Äù is 8 feet high by 20 feet long. Constructed of stainless steel, aluminum and granite with stainless steel mesh and bronze elements. It is meant to be viewed and touched from all sides and is subtly lighted with 13 lights. The 13 panels of mesh and granite create an abstracted view of the iconic image of Denali ‚ÄúThe Great One‚Äù. Sculpted in bronze, an Honor Guard‚Äôs arms release an eagle that flies toward the summit. The symbolic elements in the sculpture include:
--Honor Guard and Eagle Release ‚Äì the soul of the Veteran flies to the summit of Denali--
--Mountain showing the strength of Alaska Veterans--
--13 vertical columns representing the stripes of Old Glory--
--Missing spaces for the lives Given by the Great Land POW/MIA--
--Mesh is the strong fabric of our military men and women--
The POW/MIA flag flies over this sculptural panel.

The South Panel is ‚ÄúO‚Äôer Land and Sea a Beacon Bright‚Äú shows an abstracted ocean vista constructed of granite slabs with linear cliff forms on the mesh. In the center, the beckoning Big Dipper stars, the Honor Guard Bugler and the Presentation Flag provide realistic touchstones to this monumental artwork. The symbolic elements in the sculpture include:
--Folded Presentation Flag for the Fallen Warrior--
--Bugler plays the 24 notes of TAPS--
--Eight stars of Gold for the Big Dipper in the Alaska Flag and the Gold Stars Moms--
--North Star is the guiding light that brings the fallen back home--
--Mesh is the strong fabric of the military in our state and country and is a place to leave reminders for family and comrades.--

1277,"So I have heard nothing but raves about this place. A few up front details, they were at 80% seating, Saturday at 5pm. That being said I will start my review. First and foremost  I haven't a clue to what type of wait side service happens here, do you take my order, do I ask at the counter for my meal, when do I pay? What gives? The most unconventional type of service I think I have ever encountered. Felt somewhat confusing. The wait staff is friendly when and if they make it to your table. This leads me to believe they maybe understaffed.

Now the pizza, I have eaten at every pizza join in the Fairbanks area. I'm really not sure what you call this. Maybe this is a hippy, granola style place... You know, the place people go to eat crappy food only because it's trendy. Myself and everyone that ate our table agree, this is bottom 30% pizza for the Fairbanks area.

The plus side is the view of the flight line of Fairbanks International watching planes land and takeoff. The majority of the window seats facing the active have a few sets of binoculars to use while you are sitting there. Cold beer on tap to boot. I would go here to have a few and watch the planes do their thing (airport lounge style).

In a wheel chair or disabled, better order one to go, stairs are required to access. I am sure they can deliver to the bottom of them.

1585,"I had my car detailed by these guys. I've been detailing vehicles of all sizes for around 10 years.

Exterior-

Body had a significant amount of wax that was not fully removed.

Rims still had wax to be removed.

Under the hoodWas still dirty needed a better wipe down before dressing was applied.

Interior-
Skipped the headliner paid extra for that.

Both trays for change and misc items were still dusty with small grains of dirt.

The windows all around looked like they had been wiped with wax microfibers, they're more streaky then when we had it picked up before the detail.

Picked up 40 MINS LATE.

Let's talk business here for a second..If a customer pays you a car payment to detail their vehicle. You should be treating as if it's your vehicle. You know how nice your want it to be if it belonged to you.
If you're given from 9:00am to almost 4:00pm
To complete the vehicle, there's no excuses for.. Dirty windows..Dirty consoles..45percent of wax not wiped off..dirt on the hood..

Now I'll say something nice. Thank you for being able to pick up the car. THEY ALWAYS LOOK BETTER AFTER THEN BEFORE THE DETAIL.

Anyeay, the locale is cool, right next to a vicious creek.  Theres a horseshoe pit and cornhole lane in the front.  Plenty of space outside for you to get ravaged by mosquitos, so bring bug spray.  The views of the m li mountains are awesome.  Inside it's a quaint place, where strange but friendly locals hang out.  The pizza itself, for anyone from places where real pizza is made like the upper east coast, is a bit disappointing.  The sauce is really sweet for starters.  The crust is ok for a pie made outside of the tri-state area, and the toppings seem fresh.  But the flavor is just not what I'm used to eating.  Its wasn't bad, but it's nothing that I'd rave about.  I visited during the whole COVID pandemic, and social distancing or mask-wearing was not an issue nor was it enforced or respected.  All in all, I would not go out of my way to eat her again, I may never eat her again period, but at least I can say I tried it.

1655,"Our meal was mostly tasty, if expensive.  We started with cocktails:  2 of our party enjoying specialties, and my Alaska Grown, with gin, ginger liqueur, cucumber syrup, and lime was fantastic.  Apps were appreciated--my favorite of the 2 was lettuce wraps with seasoned and minced chicken, cilantro, red onion, daikon shreds, and Serrano chiles all wrapped in Bib Lettuces.  Delicious!  The rest if the oarty liked the Ahi Poke Nachos better than I did.  My entree was a huge piece of halibut, pesto-crusted, over fingerling potatoes and asparagus with a red pepper coulis.  It was just okay--the fish hadn't much flavor, though the coulis was very nice.  Another of us had Black Cod with Baby Bok Choy and it was very tasty.  I didn't try my friends' Scallop dish or the King Crab mac 'n cheese,  but they both loved it.  It was around this time I noticed every other table was receiving  complimentary focaccia and salmon spread, which our table of 4 was denied.  I am still miffed and disappointed at thus oversight.  But our waiter was interesting, and not in a good way.  He gave us little time before asking for our orders and kept interrupting conversation, almost as if he had little to do.  Not being offered bread by him was just the most egregious fault.  Nobody wanted dessert but me, so I went light with Coconut Mango Panna Cotta.  10 minutes after ordering it, a lady alerted us that it is new and they are finessing the plating, would not be charging us for it, and wanted our feedback.  It was another 10 minutes before it arrived and was almost terrible.  Panna Cotta should be silky and smooth.  This was dense, grainy, and rubbery with a very mild flavor of coconut milk.  It would have been helped by more sauce, but the tiny, artsy-fartsy dribbles of mango and raspberry sauces weren't enough to help or hide the dessert.  I won't order that again.  Mostly a great meal with beautiful views of Mt. Healy, but some misses will keep me from returning very soon.

I want to do a triathlon. Though it's been a LONG recovery process, I'm getting there, Trek is a great start!  I went to 6 different bike shops in Anchorage figuring I'd settle for an REI bike ($800) until I went to Trek (the last bike shop I was going to look at) WOW. First bike I road was the one I bought! ($550) which felt like the one at REI but better! It matched my budget and I didn't sacrifice on quality. The customer service has been fantastic, they have been very informative, patient and kind. I enjoy working with them and recommend them to everyone! Very reasonably  priced and there are no pushy salesmen!  No complaints! I've worked with Mike, Katie, Timely and Andy, all of which were fantastic. I'm sure the rest of them are just as great just haven't meant them yet... which I probably will cause it's awesome.

Due to covid there is a 15 person limit in the pool which makes it difficult to even have a chance to get in there they need to go back to reserving the pool and hottub so everyone has a chance to get in the pool.

They have an outdoor heated(giant gas firepit) smoking area with a nice view during any season but they do need to work on keeping it clear of snow and ice in that area during the winter season.

1939,"Two of the front office people are fine to deal with, but the manager is absolutely terrible. Not sure who thought she was a good choice for that position, but boy were they wrong. I thought customer service positions actually required decent customer service, but NOPE.

Front office issues aside, the other tenants (at least in our building) seem oblivious to the fact that there are multiple tenants in each building. One of our neighbors is smoking in their unit and it makes our bathroom and the back part of our apartment REEK like cigarette smoke. Oh, and when I mentioned this to the office they said ""Northpointe doesn't have a policy against smoking inside the unit"". Awesome.

Our newest neighbors have like 8 people staying in their 2 bedroom apartment. This past Saturday, one of their friends passed out on our stairwell and wouldn't wake up. We couldn't get our dogs down the stairs to let them outside, neither could our neighbor.

This morning, two native people were sleeping in the stairwell, again completely blocking it so there wasn't enough space for our dogs to get by them, and I had to step over them on my way to work.

Lastly, there has been a mom and baby moose on the property for about two weeks now. Some of the tenants will either try to get as close as possible and some have even been throwing rocks/sticks at it. While part of me prays you get charged by the mom moose, the other part of me knows that this is why moose get put down -- idiots antagonizing it until it gets aggressive, and then F&G shoots it. This is Alaska -- occasionally we run in with wildlife, let them mind their own business and you do the same.

Anyways, I've also read multiple posts recently about Northpointe lowering monthly rates for new tenants, and when older tenants have asked why their rent wasn't lowered, they were told they can move out of their unit and into a new one in order to get lower rent. Again, not sure how accurate this is but it really wouldn't surprise me if it is true.

The days was rainy and the swells outside resurrection bay were 6-9 feet, so we hit this cruise.  We weren't disappointed.  The crew was extremely polite and professional, and the ship was very clean (it's not a fishing vessel, after all).  Kaighlee was our captain and narrator, and she's knowledgeable about the the local wildlife, the town, it's economy, and it's history.  Jacob and antonia were our 1st mate and steward; we didn't interact with them at all but they were all smiles and very helpful to all on board.  Five minutes into the cruise and we had already seen a few seal otters, a seal, and a humpback whale.  We learned about the different glaciers in the bay, and how the bay was created.  Then we see a pod of killer whales, and they came really close to the boat.  It was awesome.  By the next of the tour, we saw the orcas, eight humpback whale, stellar sea lions, coastal mountain goats, dolphins, and learn a bit about Seward.  If you're in town and you take a day off from fishing, I'd recommend taking one of these tours.  We did the 3 1/2 hours tour, but they have others that are longer and include meals.

2393,"The¬†Tanana Valley¬†is a lowland region in central¬†Alaska¬†in the¬†United States, on the north side of the¬†Alaska Range¬†where the¬†Tanana River¬†emerges from the mountains. Traditional inhabitants of the valley are¬†Tanana Athabaskans¬†of¬†Alaskan Athabaskans.

The region experiences great extremes of temperature during the year. During the winter months, the air is prone to¬†stratification¬†due to temperature inversions, leading to thick fogs. During the summer, the surrounding plains are generally boglike, and include much¬†permafrost¬†and many¬†pingos.

The Tanana Valley is the most populated area of Alaska north of the Alaska Range. Its largest city is¬†Fairbanks.

According to James Q. Jacobs, Tanana Valley has the earliest evidence of human occupation in Alaska.

More recently, Tanana Valley sites have been dated to¬†pre-Clovis¬†period, or 13,000‚Äì14,000 cal yr BP.

The¬†Broken Mammoth¬†site, the¬†Swan Point Archaeological Site, and the¬†Mead Archaeological Site¬†are the earliest dated sites in Alaska. They are located along the Tanana River.",Advertisement,Legitimate

It would be helpful if the signage had allergens listed. We came in at 1pm and it was very busy and there was a few mins where they did not have plates for the buffet and a few items were not refilled. They did get everything back up but it seemed they may have been understaffed for how many people were there. Also, the bathroom was not as clean as I would have expected.

2537,"(Translated by Google) Initially we were attracted by the simple side of the establishment.
When ordering, the person was unable to tell us what was in the ""black and blue burger"".
Burger prices average $ 14, French fries are not included.
I priced the ""crab cake burger"".
There is not much to eat and you do not even taste the crab, it's too fried and seasoned.
The chips are not top and are ultra salty.
By asking for the WiFi code we were told that it is only for cash management.
Looking at the receipt, we realized that the box rounded the total ticket above (see photo).
Already that burgers are expensive without fries, I find it amazing that the total is rounded up, not even closer.
It's really a place I do not recommend.
Cross the street and for a little more money you will have a much higher quality.

2565,"I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, i feel like the window folks AT the PO always at least try their best to help me, no matter what I need. On the OTHER hand, mail delivery is spotty AT BEST, and i have failed to receive several important packages and correspondence because of this. Yesterday, an item i was expecting on Jan. 19th went out for delivery at 6am. I work from home, and my landlord almost never leaves her house. Starting at 530, i actually WATCHED for the postman to bring my package. At 815 i gave up. Then I received a notification that he had ATTEMPTED to deliver at 730pm but was unable to ""gain access"". WHAT?!?

We keep our cars in the garage, so nothing blocks the driveway. There are obvious and accessible steps leading right to my front door. AND we literally have the biggest mailbox i have ever seen, big house number right across it, it is in plain view on the UNOBSTRUCTED street RIGHT THERE.

So, either he couldn't locate the correct address and was trying to deliver somewhere else (not the first time), or he was LYING because he wanted to go home and had to document reasons for undelivered mail. Because he for SURE did not come to MY house.

If he had, he definitely would have mentioned the moat.

Kidding. And i am going with reason two.

Because his job is literally to KNOW WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, so if he can't do that, he should probably find another calling.",Advertisement,Advertisement

I then went and pulled down the FS 240, put the harness on, adjusted it, made more adjustments, attached the trimmer, and walked around to see how the weight was distributed and how comfortable it was.¬†In hindsight, I probably should have swung it around the motorcycles that may have got their attention.¬†At this point, I started to really notice how little they cared about the Stihl brand within their store as 2 other sets of people had come and gone by the time I had danced around with the trimmer and accessories.¬†I had spent almost 20 minutes in the store, looking at the equipment that I wanted to purchase (They didn't have a backpack fogger).¬†I then grabbed the coolant and went to the parts counter and paid.¬† During the transaction, I was asked ""Did you find everything you needed?"" I replied that I had spent far too much time waiting for somebody to assist me, so I was going to go else ware.¬†The counter guy offered to see if he could find somebody, to which I declined.¬†I have been disappointed by the Outpost, and have used the dealership in Delta as the only place I will purchase Polaris vehicles from in Interior Alaska. I only went to the Outpost because I needed coolant AND Stihl equipment.¬†They had both.¬† I was told by the parts guy that the Stihl¬†""salesman"" actually works at Fort Knox Gold mine, this was a ""part time"" job for him when he wanted to come in, and that he didn't know much about the equipment anyway.
The Outpost touts themselves as the farthest north blankity-blank dealership in America.¬†But, that is the only thing they have going for them.¬†I have never been impressed with their customer service or their service department.¬†(I spent almost $350 for them to tell me my fuel pump was bad, diagnosis only, no repair). I have purchased Stihl and Honda small engine equipment (Chainsaw and Generator), but that was because I was new in town and was willing to accept sub-par customer service as the norm.¬†But, after being here in Fairbanks for 10 years, I've learned that sometimes the little shops are the ones that shine, the glitzy dealership on the highway is based solely on their exclusivity of some brands.¬†The equipment I need to pay the bill is available elsewhere, and most all manufactures offer ""Nationwide pricing"" so, going someplace with big windows and shiny motorcycles isn't going to save you any money. Go to the little guys.¬†As far as weekend toys, I have NEVER been disappointed by going to Delta (I live in North Pole, so it doesn't seem THAT far to save a thousand or so dollars vs. these guys).

I know this was long, but after 10 years of not having anything positive to say about the Outpost, I feel I have the clout to post a long winded and factual track record experience with the Outpost. I fully expect to see a reply from their ""customer service rep"" stating ""We are sorry for bla-bla-bla, we pride ourselves in bla-bla-bla"". Well Outpost, after 10 years of sub-par customer service, I can fully feel justified in saying, Fairbanks is known for its sub-par customer service, but you get first place for poor customer service.¬†(We are sort of an island here in Fairbanks, Sub-par seems standard in Fairbanks...)¬†The Outpost only has their exclusive brands that carry the weight and ""force"" that brand of customer to go there.¬† I'll visit for fluids, order my hard-parts from online Polaris dealers, purchase my Honda small engine from either the Wood Way (I have some opinions about them), Sportsman's Warehouse (Generators and their Military discounts!) or Craig Taylor for Honda small engine and Stihl equipment.",Legitimate,Legitimate

She didnt really style it at all. When I got to the register to pay she said it would be 66. But online it said 55. And their was a sign that said 1st time customers get 20% off there hair cut. But she said straightening my hair cost extra. But no one told me that. She never said anything. So she called a manager up. But the hair salon manger left for the day. So this lady had no idea what was going on. Monah took off the 11 is cost to straighten my hair and told me that someone should have told me before the hair cut that it was extra.

The wings come out in a puddle of oil or grease and there isn't much of any actual sauce. I keep going back because at one point the sauce was good. Especially the Lemongrass.

The only staff member  worth anything is Hannah my service tech. The manager Hunter is a very nice and I do believe he means well but the  guy and has been there for 17 years has lost complete control of the dealership. The inmates are running the asylum. My salesman has neither the class or the follow through to work at a Mercedes dealership. He needs to be transferred to the Kendall used car lot. The Finance Manager, well let's just say I rather have hot Bamboo splints stuck under my finger nails rather than deal with him again. No one has a glue what goes on at that dealership. I could go on and on but I will only list a few examples. Every time I leave that place I get heartburn. I had my vehicle there several times for warranty work often for several weeks at a time. One would think after having the vehicle that long they would have activated the second key. Wrong !. Again, I brought my vehicle in for service and it was in for several weeks. When I picked the vehicle up it was filthy dirty. On another occasion my vehicle was ready on a Saturday and was promised that the shuttle would pick me up. When I called, the new service tech, Kyle informed me there was no shuttle service on Saturday  even though it had been arranged with sales. I was told later that it appeared Sales forgot and he was very curt with me. The previous service adviser had about as much customer service skills as a clam. Hunter continues to hire people who are totally unfit for the positions they hold. Today I went to pick up my vehicle and the service adviser had gone and NO ONE had the foggiest notion where the key or the vehicle had gotten to. There is absolutely  NO communication within the organization There was a fellow customer with me today picking up her vehicle and she shared some of here horror stories with me and suggest I contact Kendall. She stated she would get better service from a Kia Dealership. Like I said, I could go on and on but these are just a few example and there are many more.. Kendall really does need to and clean house !

3078,"The morning of Friday March 25 2021 about 7 or 8 am. An elder 58yr went in to eat some breakfast drink some coffee read the news paper at the cookie jar. The staff brought him to a table, so he waited for a menu Well others came in and they were seated with menus. Eventually Their meals showed up. So the Elder attempted to ask one of staff about a menu, the staff walked pass and continued to Ignore him. So after the other customers Finished with their meal he decided to get up and leave.  That's a sad way to treat your elders. Majority of Fairbanks restaurants take care of their elders.Please help us bring attention to the situation by either pressing the like or any other action on this comment.

Didn't get our food until 35 minutes later. Loco Moco was very underseasoned. It appeared that all they did was slap ground beef on the grill and placed it over rice and topped it off with some gravy. The Seafood Alfredo could have definitely been a lot better specially for the price. The sauce tasted like the canned version.

Don't get me wrong it was disappointing the first time but it just got way worse when we thought a 2nd chance was in order, that was our mistake. We love the wait staffs at most place as we've been waiters/witnesses before, but they suck. We like to sit at the bar in most casual restaurants because they won't sit children in those sections (and children are f#&king terrible). But this shi##y place let 3 dumb bimbos walk in with their nasty little toddlers after 9 pm and sit in the bar. Just because those idiots couldn't find a babysitter or use protection doesn't mean everyone wants to here their shi##y little kids cry .  .  . that's a Gallos problem and a problem for dumb bimbos everywhere.

3464,"Walking in I immediately appreciate the over all aesthetic. It feels open yet warm and welcoming. However the open space provides no sound buffer, so the dining room gets very noisey and it feels chaotic.  Because of that this is not a spot we could come for date night. I understand nothing can be done about it, but it's good to be aware of.
Now, the food....
We ordered fried zucchini, corn fritters, halibut tacos, and a bison burger.
Zucchini needed seasoning and tasted like it was cooked in the same oil as fish. Not overwhelmingly so, but noticeable enough. The sauce it comes with is good though, and they were cooked well. Nice n crispy crunchy!
Corn fritters were very good. Get them.
If you're concerned about the portions of the fish n chips get the halibut tacos. Very good portion size. I like the over all simplicity of the dish because you can taste each of the ingredients. However, same song as before in that the fish needed seasoning. Mine were also searved without the aioli which I didn't realize untill I was done with one. It def needs it. But the fish was cooked perfectly.
The burger was under seasoned as well. There wasn't much about it to stamd out as a good burger.
Oh and the fries! Reg fries are ok. I don't like most fries but wouldn't mind eating these. The sweet potato fries are good! Seems like they're battered and are a good texture. Both were seasoned well.
Over all the place feels new with all it's quirks, my partner wont return because of the noise but I will be willing to, and while we appreciate a low sodium meal the kitchen needs to up the seasoning a bit. Not just with salt, but flavor in general. I recommend 6 cloves of garlic in everything.",Advertisement,Advertisement

Fresh lettuce, tiny bit of grated cheese and half an avacado, sliced.  Had pieces of chicken, which were on the dry side and had no real flavor.  The mild salsa also has no real flavor either.  No mexican seasonings that I could taste.  I would have liked a lot more grated cheese to help with flavor.  And olives may have helped.

If you're looking for the BEST sushi restaurant in Anchorage then you need to visit Sushi & Sushi.

Remember when Sushi & Sushi was just a small sushi restaurant?  Well now they're much larger and their food is even better!  Sushi & Sushi has a bar, sushi bar, tables, booths, and private rooms.  Their menu should have something for everyone including kids.  I suggest anything with spicy tuna.

3717,"We waited 60 MINUTES to be seated on a Friday! Our server was very nice, but the meal was not. My Ship Creek Benedict of smoked salmon cakes was very fishy and not very good. There was no smokiness, needed more hollandaise, and I put a lot of hot sauce to try to make it better, something I don't do. I was sorry to have ordered it. My husband's Wild Mushroom Omelet seemed to be made with regular mushrooms and the amount of garlic overpowered the experience. Also, he doesn't like garlic, so it ruined it for him, too. There was less tea than in a store-bought teabag in both of our cups, so they were very weak.

First of all it was a gorgeous day and they have a large deck area but ""it was closed and we were not allowed to sit out there today because there was no server"" and then inside there was no view of outside.... it really sucked. The soup was OK, salad was tiny, Grizzly cheese pizza (ordered with extra cheese - but would not have known it) was a huge disappointment. Crust was so tough that I could not even cut it with the knife for my youngest daughter.

3725,"Its North Pole, so be warned.  The inside is pretty beat up and not very grand.  They have a room for birthday parties, but it's so old and drab it looks like you're having a party in a prison. In the back they have a selection of old arcade games, and a great number of them dont work, or they're so old the screens are green and horrible.  Thrtes also electric go carts on the smallest track in the world.  The laser tag area is pretty small as well.  A few obstacles and ultraviolet lights try to mask how tiny it is.  If you're having a kids party for 4 year olds, probably not bad because they dont know any better.  The bathrooms are pretty dingy as well, we went for a party, were the only ones there, and the bathrooms garbage was over flowing with paper towels and other garbage.  I can't say this place is impressive, and for the price that's charged for a 5 minute game, I my opinion it's not worth it.  But, its economical.  If you go to the trampoline park you'll pay three times the amount.  Bottom line, I'm not a fan, and I think they would be more successful if they freshened the place up a bit,like expand the tag arena and update the arcades.

The waiter was very nice and took off the charge for the coffee (without any comment from us) due to noting the long wait for us to get our food. The food was great - I had the deadliest catch which included a crab Benedict and a salmon cake Benedict with a side of reindeer sausage. My wife had the crab Benedict. We both loved the food and the coffee was also quite good. Prices are a little high. this place would be so much better if they added some staff and put in a few more tables by removing some of the wasted space in the restaurant.

The downside... $75 for an oil change. Just your standard 4-5 quarts of 5w30 conventional. Whoah! I already had my car in the bay and told them if they gave me a good deal on the mount and balance, it was all good. Mind you this was 10 degree weather, snowy, and my engine was piping hot. Not a day I would want to change my own oil.

End of the day, they unmounted 9 tires, mounted and balanced 5, and actually got the tire pressure right. Not one protest about mounting my used tires that were slightly off spec. Loaded my other wheels into the truck. Charged just $40 for dealing with my wheels/tires that were sitting outside frozen. Appreciate it guys!

3899,"Hoping to rewrite this later, but was disappointed in the service. My husband had been by the lot and found a vehicle that he wanted me to test drive. He had talked with a salesperson prior to us returning.

When we got there we went to the vehicle we wanted to look at, sat there for a bit and no one came out. That was fine.

My husband went in and was told the salesperson he had spoken with was on the phone. He told the front receptionist that we would be waiting outside next to the vehicle when the salesperson became available.

While we waited he texted the salesperson and didn't get a reply. After approximately 30 minutes of waiting we left.

As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot the salesperson called. According to him the message about us waiting wasn't passed on to him. I had the same reason used by another salesperson when I had previously been inquiring about a vehicle on the lot.

Not sure if it's being used as an excuse or the reception isn't doing their job, either way service was lacking.",Legitimate,Legitimate

4072,"This review is down a star thanks to one store employee who feels it's his duty to convey his beliefs in a passive/aggressive conduct.  First, the store is in the middle of Healy, which is pretty much in the middle of nowhere.  So prices are going to be a lot higher.  This store has almost everything for the locale: a hardware store, outdoor supplies, convenience area, and groceries. But the main reason I wont  support them again is because the attendant at the outdoor section/gun counter did not agree with potential customers wearing protective masks during the era of COVID 19.  He might have been able to make a sale on a firearm that day, but instead let me know that I was not ""awake"" because of my choice.  I choose to wear a mask, it hurts no one else and doesn't infringe on anyone else's rights.  Why he, a clerk that may be knowledgable in firearms but is nothing more than a hourly-waged saleman, feels he needs to demean me for my choice is indicative of the attitude in this country.  So for that alone, I will from now on  stock up on my goods in Anchorage,  Telalkeetna, Fairbanks, Wasilla,  etc, to have plenty of items on hand to preclude using this store.  If I need to get gas, there's another gas station next to 49th State brewery and a Tesoro up the road.  But I wont stop to purchase anything here again.  It may be petty, but the great thing about being an American is I can choose where my money goes and whom to support.  It wont be this place.",Advertisement,Legitimate

Finally on the road, I pass Ester gas and see that propane is 30 cents cheaper than uhaul, and gas is eleven cents cheaper than Sam's!  If you're filling a 40   lb propane tank and 50 gallon gas tank, these rate save a great deal of cash.  So this will be my only stop when I'm leaving town now to get propane and fuel.  The store is pretty good, too.  There is a good selection of adult beverage, the store is clean, and the staff is friendly.  They also have a self-service heating oil pump that operates 24-7.  I've only been here once so far, but they have impressed me and I plan to stop there just about every weekend as I travel the state (at least when I'm going south).  If you havent stopped here yet, I encourage you to check it out. For me, it's convenient and they have better prices.  I'm sold.",Advertisement,Legitimate

I had driven down from Fairbanks to spend a day in Anchorage.  Having arrived in Anchorage at around 6:30 p.m.; I used the Yelp app to look for a fairly priced/decent hotel without a reservation.  Because I had a car, I also wanted a hotel with no or small charge for parking.  I narrowed my search to the Marriott so I called to inquire about rooms and rates.

The hotel staff that answered was very helpful, stating rates; I inquired about discount rates and he offered me the corporate rate since the hotel was no busy.  Ten minutes later we pulled into the valet and in 15 minutes after the call we were in a very nice room facing downtown and the bay.

Everything about this room was great.  It was clean, it was comfortable and it had great view.  Moreover, it is centrally located - walking distance to all of downtown attractions.

4541,"Nov 2020: first real snow with rain and nastiness; i drove across town in the early morning. Not once did i slide into or spin my tires out of any intersection. Given you will assume i was driving safely (good choice), although driving the highways and side roads my ioniq still held strong not being a nightmare to drive in. Far better than the prius we had previously, i haven't even put on my studs. I'm also still rocking over 45 mpg in town. The wife drove out to the valley day prior and said the drive was enjoyable.
I look forward to take my car on trips now, it's not a harrowing, anxiety-filled journey any longer.
Added a star, now full 5.

Aug 2020: I have dealt with every department i could imagine dealing with and have nothing negative to say. Everything agreed to in purchasing has been followed through with, not once can i say i was mislead. Honestly had a worse time dealing with my bank than every single person here.

Service department is on top of it so far, you can get transportation to and from the shop, so one car households aren't put out.
Sales (i only dealt with Lee directly) come across genuine and don't putz. You want the car, you get that car. Prices aren't even bloated high from NADA (I checked before talking shop), yet they still play ball.
Finance is nice and don't try to bully. Logan and i had to deal with my bank for at least an additional 40 minutes, all error on the bank side. Even after and before i spent hours with the bank, it's stupid.

Needless to say, i would come back, i would trust them to do what they say, i would refer others here.",Legitimate,Legitimate

Parking is good, a little less expensive than a major metropolitan area but nonetheless still pricey.  Plenty of travel options as well, taxis line up for the arriving flights and Uber and Lyft will come as well.",Legitimate,Legitimate

I accept responsibility for not having my glasses on and not paying closer attention to our bill, but I wound up tipping 20% on top of the bill that had already included the tip. I waited tables all through college and I never would have let a party leave the restaurant without bringing that to their attention. I paid with a local credit card so it would also have been easy to give me a call and check, especially since the service during this particular visit was not great (long wait for additional drinks, forgotten plate for the child, and a forgotten side dish, plus a long wait to get served in the first place) .

I live right by the tudor center restaurant and he told me he sent my order the the A street store because tudor didnt have a driver. By 910 I just drove to the Tudor store and explained my situations. It took them 5 min to make my food. AND now I know why. Nobody seems to be listening because i ordered an adobada burrito combo and when i got home it was just the meat with the flour tortillas which I thought was for the soup I ordered. The driver calls me at almost 9:20 pm to confirm my address which also was completely wrong. The last few times my drinks were not in my order.

4917,"I'm finally getting around to this review, so I apologize on the timing of it!  On Memorial Day weekend, we were driving our new 33 ft. camper that we bought that Friday out for its first ""glamping"" trip.  Being new to the ""glamping"" life, as we were heading down from our home on Hillside, we started to smell our brakes.  We learned about brake controller's that day and that it was an additional piece of equipment needed to control brakes on the camper.  Of course, being a Holiday weekend, either the stores with brake controllers were not open or they didn't have the wiring harness needed for a Toyota truck.

5314,"This place seriously sucks. These reviewers are telling the truth. They never deliver my packages. Ever. I really hope management notices our complaints and fires these people, or at least gives them a lesson on customer service. It's gotten to the point that I purposely avoid having packages shipped to me via USPS. They either leave an orange notice, leave nothing at all, or mark it as undeliverable as addressed, which is the worst of all. In multiple instances of my mail being ""undeliverable,"" the addresses have all turned out to be 100% legible (printed slips..). I believe the courier just doesn't want to walk his lazy ass 30 feet to the door. It's not too hard to believe, either, because when you go to their location to pick up your ""undeliverable"" packages, you realize you are dealing with people that I honestly believe would prefer being dead than working at USPS. Laziest, most apathetic human beings I have every encountered. I truly despise even being in the same proximity as these losers. Can't stand it. Not to mention the inconvenience of having to find time to drive over there during their limited open hours. In summary, find somewhere else. If this is your designated post office for delivery, either make sure your house is as obvious as the empire state building, with security cameras facing the mailbox and a sign reading ""DELIVER OR DIE"", or ... use a different carrier.

Then they accidentally took the wrong person back and I waited about 15 min just sitting there till they realized. And once seated it took literally no exaggeration five minutes for her to wax and fill in my eyebrows... She wasn't who I originally booked my appointment with and the store got busy so she was rushed and I felt she could honestly care less. She also was complaining about how there was no receptionist which is understandable. The person who took my original appointment was still sitting in the chair getting hers done even after I was done and paid and walking out of the store. That was probably the easiest 20 dollars ever made.

When he put the meat platter down, it is huge! I was hooked on the first bite and I figured afterwards it's the garlic bread! The garlic bread really made it with 5 stars but since the meat variety wasn't all marinated/flavorful...I took half a star off.

5710,"I first contacted this business because of their a la carte seat shampoo service. My 45lb dog had an explosive accident, a week before the appointment date, over my seats and I didn't care for my floor mats or my exterior being clean. At least until late spring anyway.
The week old stains were spread everywhere on my back seat and a little on the front seat. Some of it even got smeared onto the door handle. I arrived fully accepting the fact that I might be charged more. The website does say they start seat shampooing at $35 but I was quoted $70. This was understandable, my car seats needed a lot of work. It was still better then the $100+ the other businesses were charging for interior packages that included services I didn't want.
About 2 hours later, I was informed that my car was done and ready. I went to the front desk to pay and was charged another $5 for the extra grunt work needed to get the week old stains out. I paid the $75 and went out to look at my car. IT WAS LIKE NEW! I was amazed at how new my car looked! They even had wiped down my dash and my cup holders. My floor mats were vacuumed and the stains on my seat belts were even scrubbed down.
This is my first experience with an auto detail business and I am glad to say that the customer service and the friendly family oriented demeanor that I picked up on, during my 2 hour stay inside the office, has definitely set the bar for me. I will definitely be taking my car back should my dog decide to give me another present or for any other matter.",Legitimate,Legitimate

This includes two tasty mini cupcakes, two mini cream puffs, two macaroons, two small scones and the equivalent of two total sandwiches, cut in triangles. All these very lovely visually. I could have purchased individual, full sandwiches and pastries and paid less. Their policy is no sharing any of this with anyone at the table or you'll be charged another $29! In total the $90 I spent, including a sandwich and tea for me, would have covered a much nicer lunch at many other restaurants.

When I got home to heat up my food to eat I actually thought it was only soup broth no meat because all of it was in bottom of bowl and there was only 8 tiny pieces of meat and the laab that I ordered wasn't even good barely enough too and to think I even tipped them... I will not be going back to this restaurant ever again they need to make sure there's enough meat per order if they want satisfied customers to keep coming back and giving them a good rating I would've rated no stars if I could this was truly a disappointment save your money and order from another pho restaurant if you want What you paid for...which is plenty and good food!!

6056,"We have had positive experiences at Providence with pediatricians, and many other doctors and staff. For those individuals, we give 5 stars. We have also had positive experiences with various practices affiliated with the hospital. We are thankful for their good care.

We leave a negative review regarding our experience with OB Triage. At 40 weeks pregnant, I showed up fevering and tachycardic, with complaints of unusual uteran pain two nights in a row. Not once was an OBGYN sent to my bedside. An under-experienced midwife and staff were given far too little supervision, and our family fell through the cracks. Proper protocol was not in place that could have helped protect me and my baby. I was told I had a ""little stuffy nose"" and was sent home to rest. I had presented with significant markers of maternal infection and never should have been discharged-let alone twice. I suffered a traumatic birth, a severe postpartum hemorrhage, and my newborn was diagnosed with meningitis. Hopefully the hospital has made necessary changes so others do not experience similar trauma. We will be delivering our next baby with Regional.",Legitimate,Legitimate
6057,"A standard for outdoor gear, I think my only real complaint might be the gun section. Nearly everytime I look at firearms I've had a weird experience. Most recently I brought in a handgun that I was looking to sell and was escorted back. The person that escorted me didnt tell the staff I was looking to sell and I ended up standing around for quite awhile. When they finally got to me, they didnt believe that I was the owner of the gun I brought in. After an extremely awkward 10 minutes of them trying to find the escort, we started to negotiate. By that time I was so put off I just wanted to leave. I know Alaska is a little fast and loose with firearms but a little more professionalism would be appreciated. Most of them seem knowledgeable in firearms...just not good customer service. Aside from that, the rest of the store actually gets a big thumbs up. üòê",Legitimate,Legitimate

6141,Kids in a a candy shop. I haven't bought fish in years because I need to set up a quarantine tank. I let down my boundaries because all tanks are separate and not on one big system and bought around $100 worth of tropical fish. Looking at all the tanks I suspected one tank had a tick and being in the candy shop unfortunately I purchase some of those fish forgetting my observation. After a couple hours I'm looking at my new fish at home  & I noticed 5 rainbow tetras had ick. I separated them from my tank with the bags that they came in and proceeded to treat them heavily and a half dose of my own 55 gallon aquarium. I called Alaska Coral and ask them to check the tank where I had purchased the fish and they confirmed that the tank has ich and were totally apologetic& very helpful. It happens but I even told the staff when I arrived every time I purchase fish I seem to get ick. I know people that purchase fish at Shady stores and never get ick. It's just something that I'm fortunately at I guess. The staff was awesome and we're concerned and reminded me on ways to cure the problem. The rainbow tetras spent about six days in their plastic bags and I was concerned about them not eating. I had separated them into four different plastic bags as to have less stress and compatibility. Lowered lights. I have baby guppies which I fed them but not all of the tetris ate. IT all came out for the best and they are swimming in my tank a month or more later. All new fish are very enjoyable. I will buy my face there again because the staff the super knowledgeable and are very good people. They gave me their personal cell phones so that I could call with my concerns.

Garrett saw me rolling toward the door in my wheelchair, opened it for me and I informed him this was my first time and I had no idea what I was doing. I was, however, hell bent on getting some gummies because that's what seemed ""normal"" to me. After explaining that not only was pain an issue from my recent ankle surgery, but at night I get anxiety and insomnia from ""cast claustrophobia"". He strongly recommended the drops, but he also recommended a lower dose than what the bottle suggested (maybe because I'm new to it?). I bought 2 bottles of the oil and one bag of gummies just to give them a try, but dollar for dollar, the drops are definitely more economically friendly. I took 12 drops with dinner and within an hour or so I felt chill AF and just a tad tired, like I'm about to have an amazing night's sleep. It could be the big day I had getting my stitches out and as new cast on, but I'm hoping it's the product working. Either way, the service was exceptional and the cost was acceptable.

It is more casual over there and you don't need a reservation. They serve the full menu plus a bar menu there. They also have some really nice window seats so you can see the pretty view. Their fish and chips are amazing. Hands down the best coleslaw I have EVER had. The lavender martini is awesome as well. I also recommend the salmon bisque. So good. We even bring the kids with us to sit on the bar side, which isn't frowned upon. They have kids coloring mats and always treated us nicely there. The best part is the kid's meals are amazing. They get fresh fruit pretty much right after you order, which is good since kids need that distraction. The meal options are healthy, include unlimited drinks and an ice cream sundae at the end. All for the same price as any other restaurant in town. You simply can't beat this place. I have never had a bad experience and we go every time we drive through town.",Advertisement,Advertisement

I've been lied to so many times here, it's not even funny. I had a service manager lie to me about parts that were supposedly replaced that weren't. I caught him by taking before and after pics of the parts. He was eventually fired but, it took a long time before that happened. I took my Dodge Ram to them while under warranty and then never returned for years until I got an airbag recall notice. It had been several years since my last visit but absolutely nothing has changed. They told me the replacement work would take only an hour or so & my vehicle would be done by noon, it wasn't done until the next day. They tried up selling me on repair work that the mechanic noticed while it was there, $1500 worth of routine  maintenance items? No thanks Gene's. I have a mechanic that'll do the work for over half that and guess what? He stands behind his work, unlike Gene's that stand behind nothing. Except how to make another dollar off their customers and screw them any way they can! I've lived in Fairbanks for 20 years now and everyone I know hold the same opinion of Gene's.

After waiting an hour just to shake the hand of the person who sold me the truck online I finally get to see it and see it had not been washed. Then I got in and found kid toys and empty cigarette packs showing me they didn't bother cleaning the inside of the truck either. I sit there for a few min looking it over to get familiar with the dash and controls since they felt that hour I sat on their couch was better spent doing nothing. I start the truck up to find out the tank is half empty. You would think when you spend over $47,000 for a truck it should be clean and have a full tank of fuel. When my temp tags were about to expire I called up and asked about my new plates. I was told they were there waiting for me to pick up. No one decided to let me know. Since I live on an island in Alaska I told them they better hurry and send me the plates since they didn't bother to tell me they were in or send them out as soon as they got them. They had my full address and instructions from when I bought the truck. But I guess that is not how this place does business. I'd look elsewhere for a vehicle.

My base care warranty was about to expire so my service adviser Jim said to get it in here before that happens. So after a couple of hours of inspection it was found that some motor mount bolts in the timing cover had come loose and subsequently sheared one off and that unfortunately this was not a covered repair. The end result was 370.00 for the repair and 30 something for the rental for the day. Upon getting my vehicle back,I look in my base care brochure and find that replacing the timing cover rather than repairing it is a covered repair.
My question is would it have been less involved to replace the timing cover than spend 3 hours drilling and tapping the old one and not have to have spent 400 something when it just may have been covered?",Legitimate,Legitimate

7282,"What you can expect from Yellow cab, based on my experience with using them approximately weekly for 4.5 years:
- If you schedule a cab in advance, it will show up on time. They've never failed me in this, and this is what takes them from 1* to 2*. However...
- Despite directions for the dispatcher and in the ""additional info for the driver"" box on their app, only 1 driver - one! - in nearly 5 years has actually shown up at the right location. The driver typically yells at me about the inconvenient location and sits in the cab while I drag my heavy field boxes to wherever he is.
- About half the drivers complain to me about my short fare from Spenard to the airport, how long they have tip wait in line at the airport for a fare, etc. I know this and have always tipped well ($5 tip on a $10 fare), but they still complain. I need a cab, so have no choice but to put up with their grumbling.
- Expect to hear their political views whether you want to or not.
- Expect them to sit in the cab and allow you to load your own bags.
- Many of them are disrespectful to women.
- If you get a good driver, get his/her personal # and contact them directly if you can. Many will not give you their direct contact info BC they're required to operate through the dispatcher.
- When you're leaving from the airport, expect to have to drag your bags all the way to the FRONT of the cab line. The socialist system that requires you to use the next cab in line means that you cannot take the cab closest to you. Again, the drover will rarely help you take your bags to the front of the line. Most of them sit in the cab and let you do all the work. But don't forget to tip!
- Do not expect a service that even remotely resembles something that operates under a free-market economy.",Legitimate,Legitimate

I don't eat this style often, closest i get is maybe taco night at home. Therefore, i asked the waitress, politely, as to what some things were and the differences between them. From what i gathered, there was little to no difference; some things had a bag of cheese from Costco on it, while some things were a bit more reserved.

So I go check again, nothing.  I ask about the specific product I spoke about over the phone, and of course they don't have it.  Oh well, I generally avoid GameStop to begin with, my first attempt at patronizing the store in probably 6 or 7 years is a terrible experience.  I'll be sticking with Amazon, at least when they say they have a product, they actually have it.  Their customer service is also light years ahead.",Advertisement,Legitimate

It's much easier than folks think‚Äî I have been twice, now, with at least three people that expressed trepidation at their ability to throw an axe with any kind of safety or effectiveness. The staff is top notch, safety is briefed extensively prior to each visit, and they had people that had never thrown a sports-type ball in earnest sticking axes into wood within 20 minutes!

I think there was just a problem with the way the barcode rang up but the way the employees handled it was horrible there was 5 or6 people in line at the end of it all and aileen should be fired for rudeness.,Legitimate,Legitimate

7938,"Very disappointing meal at the one place we usually can count on for a decent meal. Not many places in our home town of Homer, Alaska this time of year left open to go to on October 25th.

Leaving for our several month winter vacation we chose to have our last dinner in town at the Land's End Chart House. Not only do we love sitting with one of the most beautiful views during our meal, normally the food is very good.

My husband ordered a pan seared Halibut dinner. Homer being the Halibut Capital, we do quite often. His Halibut was cooked to beyond shoe leather. This was so unusual and there were only three tables of customers,  so they weren't so busy that it would be an excuse for such a terrible meal. Not only that his baked potato was barely luke warm, that the butter did not even melt.

We brought this to the attention of our waitress.  She could clearly see the fish was over cooked and the potatoes butter did not melt. She said she'd bring it to the attention of the cook after we explained they needed to know. We are locals we told her and understand some nights can be off, but wouldn't want tourists or our visiting friends or family from out of town to experience this bad of a meal.

Normally we would have been approached by a manager and offered not to pay for the meal, or a discount.  We were so shocked that our waitress after we told her and she took my husband's meal, came by with our bill, dropped it on the table and walked away. No manager, no mention of the terrible meal. We left payment and left the restaurant. I then was sorry we hadn't waited to speak with someone in charge. Jeannie our favorite bartender at the Chart House was working, although taking care of other diners in the lounge, because the dining room was closed. Wish we'd said something then, I hope it's better when we return.",Advertisement,Advertisement

8503,"This review is specifically for the Starbucks in this Target.

I visited today (8/11/16) with my husband and stopped by the Starbucks around 8:30pm for a drink. There were two girls working and the young girl with very short hair asked for our orders. We weren't ready yet, so I apologized and told her I hadn't decided yet. She immediately had a tense/exasperated look on her face, so my husband and I both checked to see if anyone was behind us that we could let go ahead. There wasn't anybody, so we looked at the menu some more. I asked the girl at the register if she had a copy of Starbucks' secret Frappucino menu that I've seen at other locations. I was greeted with a terse response about how they aren't required to have it and it's just normal drinks with added mixins but reluctantly offered to make me one if I told her what it had in it. I explained that I could only remember that it was called a Butterbeer Frappuccino. No response, just a continued look of annoyance. After an awkward pause, my husband asked me again if I wanted anything, at which time I decided I would rather not do business with your Starbucks and politely said I was just going to get a drink when we got home. My husband was also getting off-put by the cashier's attitude, so he apologized to the girl and said we didn't need anything because he also decided he didn't want to be there anymore. No response from her (aside from the glare I'd gotten familiar with during this exchange) as we turned and left.

Now, before I get written off as ""just another whiny customer"", I know how hard it can be in retail. I worked in retail for 4 years, part of which was at a Starbucks in a grocery store. I know how badly some people treat retail employees, so I always do my best to be friendly and polite. You never know what kind of jerks people have dealt with all day and I know it can wear people down. My experience also taught me how to appreciate the friendly and laid back customers that came in. Even on the worst days, I could still muster a smile and a decent attitude for at LEAST the nice customers. There is unfortunately no excuse for the way she treated my husband and I. We weren't rude or disrespectful to her. At worst, we were just being a little slow to order, which didn't seem like a problem with the absence of other customers.

Maybe this girl was just having an exceptionally bad day and let her mood get the best of her. Maybe she felt bad about her behavior after we left. All I know is that I haven't had that unpleasant of an experience with an employee in a long, long time and I hope it doesn't happen again.",Advertisement,Advertisement

8511,"Will revisit review after ""the newness"" wears off. Order of soup and slider burger was brought to the table as a single pulled pork style burger with different fries (so wrong on multiple counts). Was told my original order would be rushed through. Waiter then visited table much later to ask if I wanted a to go box for the item I didn't order and didn't touch, not knowing/recognizing that I had the wrong item AND that my original order had not been ""pushed through"" - I cancelled my soup at that point. And they had run out of the specific drink we were looking to get.

Finally got the slider burgers and chuckled to myself when I got home to see that it's simply a 4 pack of King Hawaiian Buns cut in half, a single patty laid on top of it with cheese, the other half of the rolls on top, then cut into quarters. I mean, I guess I wasn't expecting actual slider sized burgers cooked but the trick of it made me genuinely laugh.

I have at least done a little exploring of other sides of the menu, and I can happily report that FP's beer selection and salads are both on point. The kale quinoa salad is great, but my favorite is the spinach: the pecan-coated goat cheese in it is lovely and the beer-bacon dressing is outstanding. I also was really impressed by the canoli! This is an above-average pastry, light and lemon-inflected and really just marvelous.

Telling him that he needs to make his choices quickly because the store is closing. Which I have never seen cars clothes besides on holidays. And he also told him that if he didn't hurry and make his selection and go to the front and check out that he would call Anchorage police on him. I didn't watch the customer go up to the front crash registers still been followed by the security guard pay for all of his groceries that he didn't even get very much time to pick out. And then while he was outside waiting for his ride to get there the security guard stood behind him the whole entire time telling him that he needs to get off of the property before Anchorage Police are called. I'm disgusted by that behavior that's so rude just because somebody looks homeless doesn't mean that they're a theif. That's a hate crime. Profiling.

But the last few times I've been highly dissatisfied, it's like they are watering the sauce down with a whole bunch of oil or something. It's honestly quite gross. The wings come out in a puddle of oil or grease and there isn't much of any actual sauce. I keep going back because at one point the sauce was good. Especially the Lemongrass. It is WAY better than it sounds and is a life changing wing sauce.. When they do it right. Also very expensive for wings.

9122,"My rating here used to be 5 stars as my husband and I would love to have steak dinner dates at Club Paris often.

On Thursday, July 16, 2020 we had just received our food and a tall Caucasian gentleman (who I‚Äôm assuming is either the manager or owner of the place) left from behind the bar area and approached and sat down with some newly arrived guests at the table behind us and greeting them as they were long time friends.  Usually this would be great but by doing so he violated the social distancing rule as he was now a foot away from us sitting behind me.  We were happy to not worry about him and enjoy our meal but his friends started talking extremely loud with him so that the booth in front of us could also easily hear the conversation.

The first thing his friends asked him was what he thought about the newly mandated covid rules to which he replied he didn't plan on complying with them because he talked to his staff and they all felt safe. Afterwards they continued to yell and be completely disrespectful to the other guests as they cussed out our Mayor and the policies he implemented to keep Anchorage safe.

We had maybe taken 3 bites each of steak before we couldn't deal with the vulgarity, rudeness and yelling so we asked for our food to be boxed and the check and left. I feel bad for the other guests and the wait staff as besides that sour experience we enjoyed the few bites of food we had. Sadly  we probably won't be coming back and I feel obligated to lower my review and tell my friends and all guests to visit other places around town.",Advertisement,Advertisement

9241,I. Love. Sakura! Who are we kidding? The prices are outrageously expensive. But the food is SO good! I like spicy sushi rolls so I always get the Hot Night Roll. I also like the Jessica Roll. My boyfriend always gets the Monkey Brains and Las Vegas Roll. The price of a roll is about $15-17 so do the math. The rolls I got would be fairly good sized (not too small) and would be about 6-8 bites. I've tried sushi elsewhere and haven't found anything I like as much as Sakura.,Advertisement,Advertisement

They confirmed my appointment a couple of days in advance and explained how the telemedicine experience would be. On the day of the appointment they contacted me ahead of time and set me up with video conferencing that worked out really well.

I must also mention that Brittany Sedlacek who I was seeing was super friendly and it was obvious she cared about my condition. She is a great person to work with.",Advertisement,Advertisement

""i have an appt for x time for a facial with Ashley"" (heads up, the Groupon says Ashley... Pretty sure she doesn't work there, it was DeAnn who did mine... And had cancelled on me prior). The facial room looks like a cluttered dorm that hasn't been cleaned in months. She legit put some steam on my face, then slapped on a sheet mask (ya know, the ones you can get for a buck at Walmart, target, etc), left the room for about twenty minutes, came back, rubbed some lotion on and that was it.
I could've given myself a much more peaceful and moisturizing procedure at home. I've gotten facials for YEARS and being a traveling nurse, I've had to change spas regularly. I have never had one so horrible. I'm not even sure she was licensed.
Plus, the sign on the wall basically demanding tips is insulting, and so ridden with grammatical and spelling mistakes.

9677,"I must say, skeptical at first cause of the looks of the building, inside and out, but once you get a taste of any of their choices, you will be glad you walked in. I've had a few of their sandwiches and have loved every single one. My favorite though, is their chicken wrap. I always add avocado to it with extra of their ranch dressing and it's heaven in each bite. The price is what is expected of sub places, not cheap, yet not pricey either. I tend to go there for my lunch break over any other restaurant in the downtown area.

UPDATE: This is my first time going since they changed ownership about 2 months ago. I must say, although the chicken wrap is still delicious, the serving size has decreased drastically. They are charging me an extra dollar for avocado now with less in there than the $.75 cents they were charging before. Also, they had/have this promo where if you buy 10 sandwiches, you get the 11th free (punch card tracking). The old ownership would allow me to use my punch card for the chicken wrap with avocado included whereas the new ownership is charging me for the avocado now. Even though it's still cheaper than most of their food items. I will commend them on the customer service, they were all (2) very friendly when I showed up for my pick up. They had my wrap bagged up and ready to go really quick but that could be because there weren't any customers in there but 1 sitting and eating their food. I don't know how factual this is yet but I think they might be doing away with their soups. That may hurt them a lot since they have a huge crowd that goes just for their soups.",Advertisement,Advertisement

If we were sat immediately in the bar and just met Christian the would be more than a 5 star review. However, we went to the bar first waiting on a table. The bartender seemed uninterested in having more people to help claiming that several seats at the bar were taken by patrons that were outside smoking. Other customers got up while we waited for seats and sat next to these empty seats. Multiple times people tried to sit in these empty bar seats and were greeted with an abrasive bartender asking,  ""Do you plan on staying here?"" Then after someone's reply she would say there are people sitting here but they are outside smoking. There was two water glasses in those seats that looked like dirty dishes as they were sweating from the completely melted ice that once was in the glass. We sat at the bar for about an hour, I think the hostess forgot we were waiting on a table but that was ok cause a patron sitting next to us was great conversation. If the bartender was our experience here this would be a 2 star review with only the view making up for the stars. Sit in the restaurant.

However, this is by far one of the most discriminatory and self serving agencies I have ever worked for/with in my career. I believe a huge part of this is due to the small town mentality and being the only agency of its kind in Seward. The Board of Directors are clueless and in fact they are so behind the scenes that I met maybe 3 of them during my 6 years as an employee.  The Executive Director does not separate her religious beliefs from her decision making.

9877,"When I was a child, I remember going here with my grandmother and cousins. The pizza was predictably decent, the place was dark and full of wood paneling and the like in that fashion from the time. I remember being in high school and dropping a couple of quarters in a video game machine there in the lobby while waiting for my pizza.

I went here recently, with my granddaughter and my husband. The EXACT SAME VIDEO GAME was still in the lobby. The paneling was still there. The old bench seats from when I was a child? Still there. Everything was a little bit darker because, you know, age and all. Decades of dust, regardless of how well tended, had darkened the upholstery on the top of the seats.

The waiter was surprised that anybody was walking in for food. He nonetheless was very friendly and helped us come up with an affordable order of food. When the pizza came out, it was still predictably decent, a good, standard Pizza Hut pizza.

I guess they get points for nostalgia and retro and all, and I cannot fault them for anything. But this is a really good location, and it deserves a bit of an update, instead of looking like a run down ""after"" set for a time travel movie.",Legitimate,Legitimate

Second of all, they mess up orders, even when it‚Äôs very slow. I was in there a few weeks ago when no other customers were there. We ordered a dozen chicken tenders and biscuits to go. They asked if I wanted spicy and I said no, so they told me I‚Äôd have to wait while they cooked them. That was fine...I‚Äôll wait for fresh chicken any time! But unfortunately, when I got the food home, the tenders were not only spicy, but VERY spicy. We couldn‚Äôt eat them due to stomach issues and so had to throw the whole box of chicken away. Dinner was 2 biscuits each...cost= about $24.00. Pretty expensive biscuits, huh?

Very annoying considering I sat at a table and waited 15 minutes for them to cook non-spicy chicken. And it is ain‚Äôt like they confused my order with someone else‚Äôs, since we were the only ones there!

When you walk up the stairs on the firts room rifht right  wjen you walk into the waxing roo.

10591,"We made the trip to Fairbanks just to visit the Santa Claus House (Dec 22-23). I must say that I was very disappointed that it didnt feel like xmas, at all. In my mind I thought they'd have a large open space, decorated with xmas lights/decorations, for the kids to be out in the snow. The parking lot was small and dark and the store had little to no lighting around it. There was no light shining on the large Santa, in the front, so we couldnt take any good pics. I really thought they'd make an effort to make it look like Christmas inside and out since its supposed to be Santa's House, after all, but they didnt. There were no xmas lights anywhere. The only lighting was to the front, of the store, to show the facade. Going inside, I thought it'd feel like xmas too (cozy with warm feelings and all). It didnt!! It looked like any other gift shop except this one is filled with xmas ornaments (ranging from a few bucks to over $1000). Its pretty crowded, enough to make me paranoid about accidentally bumping into a shelve and breaking something, especially when we're all wearing our huge winter clothes. I didnt even enjoy myself because I had my 3 and 5 yr old children who I had to keep super close to me and under eagle eye supervision because the store is filled with expensive ornaments on the bottom shelves where kids can easily reach and break them. Not sure why anyone would call a place Santa Claus House and make NO attempt to make it kid-friendly. Its almost like they purposely planned for children to NEVER come inside. Unless its a business strategy ""lets fill this store with expensive breakables, call it something kid-friendly to trick parents into bringing their children, and maybe they'll break lots of things so the parents are forced to buy them"". If so, I guess it works. ü§£
Oh, I almost forgot... the only space for children was a 2 adult bench that was situated 4 feet from a wall-hung TV, that played the Polar Express movie. In other words, a max of 7 SMALL children (toddlers) could fit in this space (3 on the bench and 4, on the floor, at the feet of the 3 benched children). Again, no planning whatsoever since the TV was up high (about 5-6 feet from the ground) so the floor children had to bend their little necks to watch the movie.
The only thing I enjoyed was being able to buy deeds to own a square inch of the North Pole (still not sure if theyre real but super cute). I also liked how Santa was there but we didnt get a chance to take a photo because they werent accepting any more people. We showed up around 4:30pm and they said they had enough people, on the wait list, to last them until closing (6:30pm). They did mention that its never busy at opening (10am) so we planned to go back the next morning. We got there at about 10:30am and we still waited about 1.5 hrs. I guess you have to be there before opening time so you can be the first in line. I guess I hadnt noticed, on the first day, that Santa didnt have much of his own space. Like everything else in the store, Santa's space was very crowded too. His space backed up into another aisle filled with ornaments. I guess they dont make more of an effort because it IS free to have your photo taken. Note: you have to bring your own camera but they do have an employee that takes the photo for you. Also NOTE: the employee taking the photo is no professional. She cut the feet off our photo so it looked a little awkward. Overall, it's definitely not a trip worth making (unless youre really into xmas ornaments) if this is all you plan on doing. You'd be better off visiting a mall Santa!! At least, there, your kids are more free to roam.",Legitimate,Legitimate

They wanted to charge me $7 more a day for appx 1in of extra ground clearance in an upgraded vehicle & I opted to take the FORD FOCUS instead.

First delay - mechanic that was to work on her truck did not come in.  Second delay - now truck has over $4,000 worth of repairs that need to be made - maybe she should just trade it in for a new one!  She was willing to look.  Realized a week later that they had not even started on the truck!!

3950 Debarr Road, Anchorage, Alaska 99508
Saturday, December 14th, 2019 (am)
I've been to many Denny's up and down the west coast from San Diego to Anchorage. Today I went in for breakfast at the address above. I was greeted with a smile before I even got to the front door by a young man who was making sure the front was clean. When I walked in the door a lady halfway across the east room made eye contact with me, smiled and immediately approached me and ushered me to a seat giving me a choice of table or booth. I purposely chose a booth that had sight into the kitchen area. Earlier this year I had a terrible experience at a Denny's in Oakhurst, California so I wanted to observe the people here who would be preparing and serving me food. I wasn't sitting more than 30 seconds before a server approached me with a smile and greeted me and offered to get me beverages. She brought my coffee and lemonade and took my order and gave me helpful suggestions. The restaurant was fairly busy yet my food came rather quickly. It was all delicious. While I ate my breakfast I sat and observed my surroundings. The place was clean, the staff had great attitudes. The teamwork was exceptional. I could see staff high-fiving each other in the kitchen. I saw staff in the dining area happy and laughing with each other and it truly warmed my heart after a stressful week of work. When I was finished eating I took my ticket to the cashier area and was immediately helped and asked how my food was. At that time I asked to speak with the manager but he was unavailable. He had rolled up his sleeves and got in the kitchen to help. Now I am thoroughly impressed by this location. A lady approached and offered to help me. I believe she was the assistant manager. Now a group of staff has gathered with concerned looks. I truly believe they cared. As I told them about my great experience and how awesome they are and how they made me feel I noticed some watery eyes. Again, my experience was exceptional and I truly believe they care and like being hospitable. I am so glad that this Denny's is closest to my home. I hope you will take care of them as they deserve.",Advertisement,Legitimate

House made bbq sauce (gluten free)
the sauce to me was way too sweet, I prefer salty/savoury over sweet, but I appreciate that its in house made and my husband has the sweet tooth and really enjoyed the sauce.
Keeping true to the smoke house name, the meat punched me in the mouth with Smokey flavors, it was pretty awesome.
The pineapple coleslaw was honestly my favorite part even the pineapple was smoked, and for me to say the coleslaw was the best part is a big deal since I usually can only eat 3 bite of coleslaw and then gage by the 4th.
The cowboy fries (pork, cheese and bbq sauce), the fries were delicous and I'm a large fan of nacho style cheese sauce but the pork made the fries too soggy and it was way too sweet, I couldn't finish them but my husband did.
The service was helpful and quick.

My final word is that if you are one who prefers salty over sweet then this might not be the place for you, but if you enjoy a caramelly sweet bbq sauce that's not too thick and not too thin, then I recommend you drive by and try this place.",Advertisement,Advertisement

The Pro's we experienced was the view of the ocean and some of our food.

We ordered calamari, a kids breakfast and the praline french toast.

The Calamari was amazing. My toddler even ate it. I enjoyed the artichoke that was mixed in. After we ate our appetizer we waited thirty plus minutes for our actual food. Tables that were seated way after us, which we waited awhile to get our appetizer, were even served their food before our appetizer.

We waited so long for our breakfast the waitress brought my sons strawberries out seperate that should have been on his plate. That is how long we waited.

We waited so long I contemplated leaving.

Our food finally gets to the table and my son's food is cold. His bacon is so cooked it is beyond crispy, it was burnt. It wad dry, as in no moisture left in it. His eggs were sweating water because they were over cooked and rubbery. The potatoes look like they came from the freezer with dried shrivled bits of mushroom added and an onion here and there.

My french toast was fabulous. My bacon was crispy but not burnt crispy like my sons. Again what is with these potatoes you guys? You could do better.

When the waitress asked me if my child liked his food he told her no and I explained why and she didn't seem to care about my sons opinion. She just insisted he took another bite of eggs which he tried to do and spit it out. Because the rubbery dry texture was making him gag.

He ate none of his breakfast, he ate my bacon. I ate two pieces of my french toast none of my potatoes or my bacon because it got high jacked by my starving kid and we got our bill. We paid for all of the food and honestly I don't know if I want to come back.

She never offered to have it remade, even then would that had taken another thirty plus minutes? In total we were there for an hour and fourty five minutes and not much of that time was spent eating.

I recomend to everyone if you are wanting to wait for good breakfast food actually made from scratch and not over priced go across the street. That is worth the wait.",Advertisement,Advertisement

Sauces, miso, radish dishes served before the meal are somewhat vinegary and dominates the other flavors so you don‚Äôt really taste much other than vinegar. The bowl itself was MASSIVE. Like a pho bowl. Had to take some home and eat for lunch the next day.

If you get the ice cream, the Red Bean is the BEST. I‚Äôd say second best is the Green Tea one if you don‚Äôt like beans.

In my opinion the best muffins made in Anchorage are right here at Fire Island Rustic Bakeshop.

There are three locations, but I was told the √úber Blueberry Muffins are made here.

This location is smaller, so seating is limited.  The parking lot can also be a little tight, so consider parking on the street if busy.

I just attended a middle school graduation for a granddaughter here. Recent upgrades and renovations have taken away from it's historic ambiance, but were much-needed. While I sorta miss that the flooring doesn't creak and moan anymore and the old feel of the depot was sacrificed for sake of modernity and functionality, the graduation went well, in part thanks to the improvements.

11419,"""The website ad for 2 pairs for $59.95 said that the glasses could be finished in 15 minutes, but when I arrived, I was informed that the frames that qualified for the deal had to be mailed in, which would take two weeks. This information wasn''t shared until after I had already gone through and paid for the exam, otherwise I would not have gone with your company.

I was then told that if I went with other frames, they could be completed in-store, obviously a slimy tactic to get customers to purchase more expensive frames. I then chose other frames only to be informed at the last second that my prescription was too high for them to be completed that day. This was after I called ahead of making an appointment to ensure that my high prescription would not cause any additional expenditure, delay, or other issue.

Customers should be informed ahead of time that the \""15 minutes\"" does not apply to everyone and that if you have a high prescription, it may cause significant delay.""

I sent that correspondence on July 1, a couple days after my experience in the store.

I called July 12 and was told that my glasses would arrive in Anchorage the next day. They told me they would be shipped to me in Fairbanks and should arrive at my address in two days. It is now July 21 and I have still not received my glasses. This is after my horrified experience in the store, where I felt mislead and taken advantage of even after my attempts to proactively ensure I would receive service as advertised. It has now been almost a month and I have not received my glasses. This is absolutely unacceptable and bordering on illegal. I have paid cash money with the expectation that I receive a product in return the same day. Stanton Optical has failed to do so and you has failed to provide reasonable recourse for that failure. I honestly believe I should be issued a full refund at this point in addition to the $50 credit they have applied to my account.

I have never been so angry, sad, and disappointed at a company. I have a high prescription, just started a new job, and really need my glasses for work. I rely on them too much and the incompetence of Stanton Optical has caused me a great deal of not only emotional strain, but additional strain on my eyes. I originally went in because my glasses broke and I chose Stanton because they were supposed to offer the fastest replacement. I now highly regret ever choosing Stanton. I would advise that you try any other option before you even consider choosing them yourself for fear that you might experience similar horror and literal physical pain from eye strain.

The place is clean and friendly, shoes are clean, and you're given a brand new pair of socks that you keep upon leaving. Bowling balls are available in all sizes and weights, and the booth & computer are comfortable and easy to set up your game. I've no issues with center bowl in all the times I've been there....

11701,"As usual, the review has to begin with the Alaska disclaimer.  Prices here are higher than most other places.  Why?  Because the cost of living is high in Alaska.  Bottom line, it doesn't matter where you are around Fairbanks, things are expensive.  That being said, this a cool place to stop in any time of the year.  Where else can your kids (or you adults) meet a very real-looking Santa in July, in North Pole?  Nowhere.  This place has a great selection of Alaskana items and souvenirs, as well as toys, books, and other Christmas items.  There's also a little coffee stand inside, very good during the winter events.  You don't have to buy anything, but if you venture into the Fairbanks area this is a must-see place.  It's a neat little shop that helps lend to a holiday, year-round.  I recommend everyone that visits the area stop by and check it out.  You won't be disappointed.",Advertisement,Legitimate

===Seafood chowder from Tamera's Seafood is divine, absolutely divine. The cream broth is delicate, with a sheen of butter?margarine floating on the surface. Not thick like some chowders. Thus, the slice of white bread served with it? Meh. Thin and floppy...think wonder bread. Such exquisite chowder should be served either with a THICK SLICE OF FRENCH BREAD OR crispy, salty oyster crackers instead.
===Speaking of oysters...
Fresh oysters from Jakolof Bay Oyster co. are meaty, buttery, and tangy. AT 2.00 each shucked, go ahead, get a dozen and slurp away-- add a squeeze of fresh lemon or a splash of garlic onion vinagrette and OMG your tastebuds will do the happy dance. The sellers incorporate a single bladed hand shucker, as opposed to other sellers at other markets that use a mechanical shucker. The result is that you'll slurp your treats one at a time, as each is shucked rather than have a plateful handed to you or whatever number you've ordered. And, you may have to wait your turn as the single shucker shucks an oyster for multiple paying customers. Again, I highly recommend a mechanical shucker. Serves more people faster.
===The Blueberry jam from Bob's is best eaten with a spoon straight out of the jar, or slathered on warm buttered toast. Make sure the bread can support the weight of the jam, however, or you'll just have mess when the bread disintegrates under the weight of the jam. Suggest a HEFTY slice of multigrain wheat bread.
===Farm fresh eggs from Bob make superb fried overeasy eggs. The yolk is thick and saffron colored.
So, a meal of fresh eggs, blueberry jam, and oysters, sounds delicious.
====Rhubarb lemonade is a buck, but is more like plain pink lemonade. It is made from the water that rhubarb is boiled in to make jam. So, I give the seller credit for making use of the rhubarb infused water.
===We bought a 1/2 dozen precious notecards decorated with ravens of all colors engaging in crafty raven activities. The seller was an enchanting woman with a broad smile and a willingness to chat. ====Now, you will pay sales tax on the handicrafts. Go ahead pay it, don't whine about it. Some guy---who actually lives in Homer was giving a young sales lady grief about paying the sales tax (2.00--that's two dollars) on his purchase.
She was most gracious with this less than gracious customer.
===The handicrafts are priced as good artwork should be and the tax is what it is.
===Parking is free, and is a bit of a rodeo. The one way single entrance/exit are NOT well marked. The market is at the crest of a hill on the upside of a curve.
====Traffic is heavy...(it is summer, and thus tourists like me flock to Homer). We accidentally entered at the exit, and there was no way to back out of it as it would have put us into oncoming traffic. Visibility is poor if you are at the exit trying to exit, especially if a vehicle is entering the exit (like we did) and blocks the view. Thanks to a couple of gracious out going drivers, we were able to wiggle our Subaru between the two cars and slip into a nearby parking space.
====On the other hand, take a couple of sturdy tote bags and walk.",Advertisement,Advertisement

11892,"I'm a huge BBQ fan, so finding out this was a place endorsed by Guy Fieri had me all sorts of excited! To start with, the food here was good. I had brisket with potato salad and garden salad. The wait staff was also excellent. I enjoyed talking with the bartender, and she made some winning recommendations for which beer I should try next. They make their own in-house sauces too - which are amazingly good! My problem was with the portions. I left still wanting more. But it was late and the kitchen had already shut down by the time I asked about ordering more food. I've been to plenty of other BBQ places though while I've been traveling. This ranks right up there in taste but lacking in portions. This is even considering that I was given extra salad by accident. The salad went surprisingly well with kolsch by the way. Can't say I enjoy beer with my salad very often, but I did here! This place is definitely worth stopping in to grab a bite. Just be prepared to still be rummaging for munchies later when you get home. I've went to other places with comparable prices and served so much food I had to take half of it home for an entire 2nd meal the next day. This is not the case here, unless you splurge for the pig out platter. Again, excellent food and wait staff, lacking in portions for the price. But it's also possible that brisket is more expensive for them to get up here with COVID too. I dropped over $20 on food here, not including drinks, so I'll leave a picture and let you decide.

George Parks Highway (numbered Interstate A-4 and signed Alaska Route 3), usually called the Parks Highway, runs 323 miles (520 km) from the Glenn Highway 35 miles (56 km) north of Anchorage to Fairbanks in the Alaska Interior. The highway, originally known as the Anchorage-Fairbanks Highway, was completed in 1971, and given its current name in 1975.

The highway, which mostly runs parallel to the Alaska Railroad, is one of the most important roads in Alaska. It‚Äôs the main route between Anchorage and Fairbanks. Alaska's two largest metro areas. The highway is the main thoroughfare  to Denali National Park and Preserve and Denali State Park + the main highway in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley.

*Cash-only with 2 ATMs nearby

Thoughts:
*Each Barber here has their own specialty and character - GERRY Sr. Specializes in excellent traditional cuts / GERRY Jr. Is quick and excellent at a much wider range of cuts / EVA is excellent at detail work and unique requests.

Cliff notes:
*Hours of operation are posted, though occasional family vacations and weather may see the shop closed outside of expected timeframes.

The restaurant was very understaffed, we waited at the wait to be seated podium for 8 minutes, there were at least four couple's behind us who also had extended wait time. Food delivery was very slow, for simple meals, which gave us so hope of a quality meal. See above for those results.

Our waitress was very polite, but I did have to dump food particles from my chair, and the table I was able to clean several discoloration off with just a napkin.

Silverware, and straws were brought late, as we could not see our waitress went to the next table to aquire, sugar, and catsup.

Refill on tea we're prompt, and my friends egg olmet was very well done.

They do not offer a senior meal not offer 1/2 orders on even biscuits and gravy.

I find it interesting that a Denny's just a few blocks away closed, and yet this establishment is still open, but I doubt for long unless quality and customer service becomes Job 1. As well as keeping the bathroom clean, and the ladies was the worst of the two.

I find it interesting that over the years I have many times visited the bathroom first and left just because of dirty bathrooms, I did not do this and I feel it was mistake. I don't think I'm going back for a new review.",Legitimate,Legitimate

My wife and I went out for brunch and I certainly had trouble deciding on anything. Eventually chose the ""Hair of the Dog"" biscuits and gravy and it did not disappoint. Housemade beer biscuits were amazing and the whiskey reduction was a nice touch to already excellent sausage gravy. Local beers on tap alongside plenty of mimosa options... what's not to like? Wife enjoyed her vegetarian sandwich and quinoa a lot.

Service was a bit slow but all the employees were sincere, pleasant, and professional. I don't feel like it took away from the overall experience.

Long story short while I was on vacation there was a notice placed in my box that they were no longer going to deliver my mail if I did not move my box 6 inches closer to the road.  In those last 7 years the only thing that has changed is 2 more boxes have been added to the end of the row and they do stick out 5-6 inches further than the rest. I was given 1 week to fix the problem.  Well when I got back from vacation 2 weeks later I had not received mail for al most 2 weeks.

12660,"This place is unusual, but really good. There's a wheelchair ramp, but the screen door opens the wrong way, so the ramp is not a usable entrance into the building. You can make reservations, but the chef cooks one dish at a time-- so you get one dish out at a time. The waitress is the chef's daughter, and she's very straightforward and a little scattered. When you walk in, she's immediately worried about your experience. She tells you, ""Let me tell you how this restaurant works. The hand-written menu is on the walls. Don't ask me what you should order because I don't know your tastes."" Then, she tells you about the homemade sesame spinach and homemade gyoza. Get both of these items. The spinach is cold, and I was really regretting my decision to order the spinach... until I tried it. Seriously-- it's the most delicious vegetable I have ever eaten in my life. The homemade gyoza was amazing-- I think the chef's wife makes it. Anyway-- it didn't even need sauce. It was delivered hot and crispy right to our table. Our table had the chirashi zushi and two bowls of ramen. Everything was delicious, and we were assured it was quite authentic several times by our Japanese grandmother. The broth for the ramen was out of this world. I could have eaten just the broth and been happy. The food is very, very good, and even though the way the restaurant works is vastly different from your typical restaurant, it's totally worth trying out. It feels a lot like you are walking into someone's home for dinner. Cash and cards are accepted-- our waitress had no trouble with the card. The chef's wife came and spoke in Japanese grandmother while we waited for our food to be served. This place works best for groups of 2-3, but they can do big groups of maybe up to 12-14, as long as you are patient and do not expect your food to come out all at the same time. The sesame spinach is a must-try, and the ramen bowls are huge.

This entrees are $16-$40 each, depending on what you get. The appetizers are $7-10. Green tea is a $1/cup, and was very fresh and tasty. They have a limited beer and sake selection-- we did not partake, but they had sapporo and I don't remember what their sake selection included.

We will definitely be back. There are a bunch of things on the menu that we still want to try.

I can see where some of the negative reviews might have come from-- we weren't really sure what to expect when we walked in. We knew it was a Japanese restaurant, and the waitress seemed a little like she expected us to decide to leave instead of staying once we saw the menus on the walls. If you're expecting Benihana-levels of service, you'll be disappointed... but if you expect the service you'd get from going to a friend's house for dinner, you will be quite happy here.",Advertisement,Advertisement

Indoor pool, was the main reason we chose this hotel and it was great with a nice hot tub on the side. Overall extremely pleased with the hotel and the service - everyone was very nice.  A few very minor downsides that dropped it to 4 stars instead of 5 were: pool towels were tiny and not plentiful and usually had to ask them to restock and even then only a small amount was brought out so as soon as another family arrived - they were out of towels instantly.  Also the breakfast buffet they served ran out of bacon and scrambled eggs only 30 minutes after breakfast started which was a 2 hour long breakfast period (luckily I got 2 strips of bacon - but my kids were out of luck) and when I asked the worker if they were going to bring more bacon she said unfortunately they didn't have any more thawed out because the night girl forgot to thaw the breakfast food.

I wasn't even notified that I was, in fact, still on the list or that they weren't expecting to meet my scheduled time. No apologies either. Just some stone cold, expressionless, ""30 more minutes"".

3. Grocery store.  Great selection with great prices.  A meat dept (no prime rib), frozen foods, coolers and camp chairs.

4. The outpost is great.  Opens at 11:30 daily and closes at 8 pm.  A great place to gear up for the hunt or get that thing you forgot.

5. An Ace hardware store on the north side.

6. Gas station out front with Diesel and regular.  Good prices (3.12 for 87 octane).  RV refuelling area and heating oil and propane sales.

I called eagle river Polaris and they were about the same.

As we were heading back home we got a call from the driver saying he was here. We let him know we were a few minutes out and my brother could take the order if he was allowed to. He quickly explained the policy that prevented this and that he would wait for just a few more minutes for us. ***15 minutes later*** I pull up to my house go see this, I would say saintly, person standing with our food. He was all smiles and ""no worries"" and just really amazing towards us.

Less expensive flooring in the situation I‚Äôm referring to, not only once but after the project was started came back a second time with an even cheaper option.

Taylored will ONLY out one coat of paint on your walls

Taylored will NOT do any matching for transition strips from vinyl flooring to next

Taylored WILL leave cabinets unfixed to walls an unleveled

Taylored says they will send a final cleaner, however none of the ceiling fans in house were cleaned, cobwebs in the corners of ceiling from dust collecting, not a single window cleaned, adhesives left to the flooring from when they covered them to protect them

Only came in 7 weeks behind schedule & hear nothing but complaining coming from project manager Brian. Throughout the project I was monitoring for out of state friends, Brian (the project manager) treated me like literal garbage, abusive language towards his staff and customers, has a superiority complex, sucks at customer service & could clearly care less above finishing project in a timely and professional manner. A complete jerk!

I hope everyone at Taylored has to deal with a project where someone like Brian is their contact so they can see the level of customer service they are allowing their brand to represent.

Needless to say, if you‚Äôre able, save yourself the headache and go with another company.

There was only a single person doing the majority of the installation work. Was expected to do sheet rock, paint, trim, plumbing, electricity.

If we were sat immediately in the bar and just met Christian the would be more than a 5 star review. However, we went to the bar first waiting on a table. The bartender seemed uninterested in having more people to help claiming that several seats at the bar were taken by patrons that were outside smoking. Other customers got up while we waited for seats and sat next to these empty seats. Multiple times people tried to sit in these empty bar seats and were greeted with an abrasive bartender asking,  ""Do you plan on staying here?"" Then after someone's reply she would say there are people sitting here but they are outside smoking. There was two water glasses in those seats that looked like dirty dishes as they were sweating from the completely melted ice that once was in the glass. We sat at the bar for about an hour, I think the hostess forgot we were waiting on a table but that was ok cause a patron sitting next to us was great conversation. If the bartender was our experience here this would be a 2 star review with only the view making up for the stars. Sit in the restaurant.

13604,"So the hours say available until 11pm. However I got there at 10:05  on 12-11-2020 and found the entrance to be blocked off by a truck. There were people in the line, so I was a bit confused to say the least. Well, I went in through the exit and looped around, then waited in line for 40 minutes to order a drink.

We don't have a Sonic in Anchorage where I am from and I just wanted a diet Dr. Pepper with a shot of vanilla and a banana split for my wife. Well, we finally got to order and the employee demanded, in a very rude tone I might add "" How did you get in here?"" I replied that the entrance had been blocked off by a truck, which didn't make any sense to me since they closed at 11pm so I came through the exit. The employee then replied that they stop letting people in to the drive through at 10pm. this was pretty shocking to me, as it is a whole hour before closing.

When I asked why they stopped letting people in at 10 she replied that it was to clean the fryers.

I have no idea who in management came up with the idea to have  place listed as open until 11pm when they stop taking customers after 10pm. If your hours of operation are until 11pm, you should be able to take customers up until that point. If you want to clean the fryers at 10pm, then maybe switch your hours to close at 10pm.

Or at the very least maybe have a sign saying you do not accept anyone after 10pm?

Both Korma & Tikka Masala tasted absolutely amazing my taste buds were in heaven & the Chicken was perfect, moist with a tender buttery texture. We stuffed ourselves and still had a bunch of leftovers to take home for later. Our server, Kayla, was super sweet & helpful

The one thing I was disappointed I didn't see on the menu was a food that my sitter/nanny used to make for me when I was little and that was a Yellow Rice dish that she sometimes put tomatoes in.

Good: They are pretty good about working with you provided you pay your bills and don't give them a hard time. The owner of the lot owns the shop across the street, and is capable of getting things fixed quickly.

Bad: My family and I have gotten three vehicles from this lot, and it's apparent that whoever conducts the vehicle inspections is cutting corners. All 3 vehicles had failed valve cover gaskets which leaked slot of oil into the spark plug wells. 2 out of 3 had failed ABS systems, and all three needed spark plugs changed due to improper gap.

13771,"Interesting to see how other rate a used car sales place as five stars or ""top notch"".  I guess I have a slightly different view.   First off, yes, their sales pitch is pretty easy and alluring: a hands-off, no pressure approach.  You cansign out cars to test drive..  You can walk on the lot and not a single salesperson will bother you.  And yes, buying the car itself is easy.  However, no matter how you look at it, you're not getting a good deal.  All of the sales tactics are easy when you're in Fairbanks.  The competition  is pretty limited, and any of the new car dealers in town make it easy to come to a place like this.  They promote a no haggle price, and sadly most people fall for it.  Check it out people: you're supposed to negotiate the deal.  However, again, because it's Fairbanks, the upper hand lies with them.  Here's what I say.  Do your research on the vehicle you need.  Shop across the state, including Anchorage.  And do not put yourself in a position where you desperately need a car.  You will get screwed.  They'll also tell you that they charge a $250 fee for registering a vehicle and make it seem like its convienent for you, but be aware.  You're getting robbed.  Titling a vehicle in Alaska costs $15 and registration is $100 for two years.  So it's hard to say that the extra $135 is worth the 20 minutes in DMV.  Yes, DMV in Fairbanks  is pretty efficient plus they serve a very small population. For registration you're never in there that long.  So, don't get stuck having to buy a car, plan that purchase well in advance.  DO negotiate the price with them.  Get your own financing, you'll get a better rate at the bank or credit union, and don't let them tell you that their registration fees are saving you time.  All it does is make them more money.  Yes, the sales guys are nice and helpful.  But that's how you make money.  Are they better than the Chevy dealer?  I'd say so.  But the bottom line is they do massive monthly turnover so they're making a nice percentage off the public.  Good luck.",Legitimate,Legitimate

The non-reserved ticket price is 4$ (Jan. 2019) & the theater seating has tables for food & beverages (alcohol too). There is also balcony seating (my favorite).

Ordered food from the concession stand / restaurant is delivered to your seated location, marked by numbered orange cones, obtained when ordering.

There are spotters in the theater to direct waitstaff to your location.

There is a plethora of food options, along with typical movie theater fare... AND the prices are reasonable when compared to major theater concession costs.

Only one theater exists, so the rotation of films throughout the day (up to four movies per day) and week are published online.

This place is run by a wife and husband team. The husband being a retired commercial airline pilot with over 30k hours of flight experience all over the world. This is an important fact, because airline pilots are a very meticulous breed; paying attention to every detail is a must.  Quality is of the highest priority and it shows! The wife is native to Thailand and not just that, but having been in the restaurant business in her homeland. Authenticity and originality are the theme and fort√© you are rewarded with here.
Here we were greeted with warmth (temperatures were sub zero at the time), kindness, and a friendly smile. Appetizers were fantastic too, while waiting for the main course to be delivered in a timely fashion. You are able to personalize anything on the menu, excepting the Larb and one other menu item I can't recall. You can request any degree of spiciness you desire, which is typical.
This place is a must visit ASAP , as the owners are planning to retire to Thailand within a 3 year period at this time. Hopefully it can stay open under equally qualified management in the future.

For brunch I had the prime rib sandwich. The sandwich was on a overly saturated bun that fell apart and the meat was full of fat. I took a few bites before deciding this was better suited to be dog food. At least they had the courtesy of taking the sandwich off my bill.
I don't think we will be returning until they have an over haul of their chef and menu.

Other doctors said it wasn't worth trying to repair and just to cut the torn portions out, which would lead to more surgeries later and a full knee replacement.

I mention to him a sensor failure notification and he tells me he will get it looked at, likely needs cleared or may need an update.
I go to pay and he tells me I'm not eligible for the two for $99.95 ""likely because it was purchased pre-owned"" and my total is now $70. Nearly double the expected cost.

At the beginning the menu seemed a bit expensive to us but the dishes really gave us cravings.
We had a table upstairs where there is a very large bay window which gives a very nice view of the mountains.
Before choosing a beer, we were offered to taste a sample to choose between different tastes, I've never seen that elsewhere it's great!
We had the Salmon and the Scallop Mac.
The salmon is cooked to perfection and is placed on a Thai-style rice, a real delight!
The other dish is a Mac & cheese made from scallops, a delicious dish.
The. Service is welcoming and warm.
We got it for $ 80 for two with 1 beer and 2 courses plus taxes and tips.
It might be a bit high but it's totally worth the trip because it's delicious!
I preferred this restaurant to other cheaper ones in cities which were not great.

The owners mother served us and after agreeing to her rule to take our pizza box trash with us after being done (just get bigger trash cans guys!) she then took our order and wanted immediate payment... Her response to customers about the 1 dollar credit surcharge was despicable - Square charges a fraction of that.. But all of this was nothing compared to the wait, there were other customers and I actually timed that it took them on average 14 mins to serve each ONE handmade ice cream. So don't order two..

The staff seemed disinterested, the ice cream was okay and the space is nicely decorated and pretty clean.. But if you're gonna go here, I recommend you make your order and get on the couch if they let you, and just order extra sweet ice cream to sweeten the sour service.",Legitimate,Legitimate

I finally had to call and talked to finance they were finally able to tell me that i did infarct have an appointment scheduled.  The dealer reached out to me on numerous occasions before my purchase the follow up after the purchase has been zero.  I did email the dealer manager no responses and no responses from the sales person.

14560,The service was great but the food was mediocre-poor.  My wife and i ordered appetizers( crab cakes and nachos). The nachos had a bad after taste after eating each bite and the chips were horrible. The crab cakes are like sliders and it felt as if was drowned in the dry coleslaw. I took the crab cakes and ate it by itself. The bread for the sliders were overbearing. The bread was bigger than the crab cake proportion so i took the bread edges off.  We didn't finish our appetizers so we ordered food.  I had the prime rib which was a special and what seemed a staple i was told there. The prime rib was dry and was well done. I requested it medium rare. I dared not to try the dessert given our previous meals. My wife ordered a salad and was afraid to try anything else given how the appetizers were. The salad was good. I can tell you the drinks were good and the waitress kept my alcohol topped off so eating my food was manageable. Im willing to try again but not too soon. Maybe in the future and my review may change.,Advertisement,Legitimate

The pizza was predictably decent, the place was dark and full of wood paneling and the like in that fashion from the time. I remember being in high school and dropping a couple of quarters in a video game machine there in the lobby while waiting for my pizza.

I went here recently, with my granddaughter and my husband. The EXACT SAME VIDEO GAME was still in the lobby. The paneling was still there. The old bench seats from when I was a child? Still there. Everything was a little bit darker because, you know, age and all. Decades of dust, regardless of how well tended, had darkened the upholstery on the top of the seats.

The waiter was surprised that anybody was walking in for food. He nonetheless was very friendly and helped us come up with an affordable order of food. When the pizza came out, it was still predictably decent, a good, standard Pizza Hut pizza.

When you walk in the cafe looks pretty nice, the menu items sound delicious. The actual food.... nope. I ordered a chicken sandwich. I could see it was burnt when the waitress brought it out and as soon as she set the plate down I told her it was. She looked at me like I was crazy and told me that it was not burnt..... when everyone at my table looked at the chicken they looked back at her like she was crazy and agreed that what she brought WAS burned (I did not order any blackened or BBQ chicken) she seemed annoyed and said that She would ask if the chicken could be remade and then asked if it could not be made would I want something different. I asked that I would like what I ordered without the burned chicken and if it could only come out burned then I did not need anything. She came out to let us know that the chicken would be remade. This 2nd sandwich was not burned I took a bite and a friend of mine took a bite only to be grossed out by the smell. If they will let you I suggest ordering from the kids menu (if you can't make it to a different place or home to cook that is)I can't recall the exact name of the sandwich  but ultimately I received smelly fried chicken on a decent bun that included Cole slaw and caramelized onions with pickles hot sauce on the side. Took one bite and ended up only eating the cole slaw, my friend ate a quarter of the bun and we left it there.... I will never go back to actually eat here. I can't say that the waitress was terrible (I tipped her well even thought it was not without a turn in my stomach doing so) but she was not great either as I've never had a waitress argue about something that was so clear as burned chicken, to myself and the rest of the people at my table. The salad is nothing special but edible, the fries are fine. None of it though is worth the price you will pay once the bill arrives Oh yeah, and the ketchup is gross.",Advertisement,Legitimate

I called in FATS to get a quote for brakes and rotors serviced and their prices were much less compared to midas, meineke, and all other auto shops who could've serviced me same day. I had to wait 3 days to take in my car to F.A.T.S. because they were very busy those days. WORTH THE WAIT. I went early in the morning and got my vehicle inspected immediately and taken in for service. They walked me to the car and showed me exactly what was wrong before working on it. It turned out to be worn bearings and alignment service needed, my brakes still had 70% usage left and rotors were good. It cost a little over $300, but they did a great job and saved me alot of money from being cheated by the authorized dealer and other corporate shops who wanted to charge me $1100-2000+. This local shop is professional, honest, and probably the best price in town. Great customer service.

15348,"If you're building a small or massive project then you'll find all the materials at SBS.  There are two locations in Anchorage; this location doesn't have the vinyl siding, so you'll need to visit the other location at 7828 Lake Otis Pkwy.  This location is open on Sundays, unlike the other location.  Plenty of parking at this location!  Sadly this location has really tall stairs and the ramp is narrow, steep, and far away from the main entrance.  If your legs are sore from a workout; if you suffer from a physical issue that requires handrails; or if you're in a wheelchair then you'll want to use the entrance near Tudor Road and not the main entrance.

SBS is owned by Builders FirstSource out of Dallas, Texas.  Builders FirstSource is a publicly traded company NASDAQ: BLDR.

I would give them an excellent rating except the service is, more often than not, downright rude.

After 2.5 hours I was dialing the phone to tell them to forget it when the delivery driver arrived.  The driver was extremely friendly and apologized for being so late.  When I looked at the receipt I noticed they had charged me twice.  When I called about the double charge, the guy who answered the phone listened and said, ""ok, we'll fix it"" and hung up.  So, they have pretty good pizza and most of the time we visit service is so-so to just rude.  We know that going in.

Atmosphere is definitely clean and has that hipster vibe (doesnt fancy my boat, but its better than standing up and eating on the go). Now the negative. Looks like theres a lot of people who can agree. The ""Chicken Shack"" Chicken is very bland. The batter is soft, greasey, and the chicken is ""slimey"". Burger is bland as well. Never had to add salt onto a pricey burger before, but yea, it needed it (still couldnt finish it. I dont like wasting food, but my family and I could not even get the initial start going). Back to the chicken.... there was an error on our order, but it was quickly rectified (too quick). Appears we got some ""15 min under the heat lamp"" chicken.

This is a fun place for the whole family and although it may be more spendy than some other types of family activities offered in the mat su Valley its definitely worth the extra money you will spend there.  It's been awhile since I've seen the entire family having a great time in the same place with no griping or complaints of boredom.

The signs are all so confusing because it does not show you the path that goes 1.5 miles so once you get to the top from the 3.5 five miles come to a sign that points to the trail that you came from and another sign that points to the trail that goes further but if you look perpendicular to the sign there's another path there and that is the 1.5 miles.

15988,"As with many places during this time AT&T is offering curbside service. As a mother of 2 under 3 I have utilized this service wherever possible.  Unfortunately, they have not executed it as well as many other places that offer this wonderful service.

Prior to arriving I called and had them set aside the things I wanted. Just a heads up, YOU CAN NOT PAY OVER THE PHONE.

I get there and call the store, press the button that corresponded with curbside pick up and after 3 attempts (first:  they hung up on me before asking my name, second: I gave them my name and what I had ordered, third: they called me because they didn't know where I was/ what I was driving). Even after that I still had to shout at them to bring the items to me.

When it came time to check out, apparently being 4 cars away from the building was too far so we had to walk to the front door to pay. And still, that was too far and the customer service representative had to take my card inside the building to pay for my items.

I'm not sure what convenience their curbside service is offering at the moment, but I have some suggestions for them:
1) have curbside dedicated parking (preferably closer to the building)
2) allow pay over the phone especially if you can't offer dedicated curbside parking
3) get better service/ signal for your workers to make payments especially if you can't offer the previous 2 suggestions. I'm sure there are reasons for it, but it just looks bad for a service provider to not be able to go 25 ft from the building and make a sale.

A wide variety of excellent dishes make it hard to recommend any particular one, but the portions of each are always generous and something can be found to fit your current appetite.

The place truly shines behind the bar, with an extensive collection of wines and liquors backed by the best bartender in Alaska, Ylli Ferati.

If you're lost by the staggering amount of options, he'll find the right thing for you based on your taste! Enough can't be said about his collection of whiskies and knowledge thereof.

I know all of our beer tenders and alot of our locals enjoy a pint or 2 after work most days. 2 PINT MAX.  ITS GREAT! Sometimes too noisy but avoid ""HAPPY HOUR"" and afternoons are peaceful and weekends vary. This is a great spot for a short social with friends and pooches ( yes, dogs allowed on a leash and good behavior) and little ones too ( no leash, but well behaved and with parents always) üôÇ. Enjoy a sample if your not sure. Like something and dont want to hang, get a growler to go or a ""medicine bottle"".T shirts, hoodies and souvenir glasses and other swag. You'll have to stop in and see. You may even admire/ purchase artwork from any one of local talented artists. Maybe even say hi to me.

16469,"Forgive me for leaving a Tolstoy-length review about my experience ... is Dr. Ehrnstrom a good physician? Yes. Is he good with people? No. The man never even took the time to introduce himself, which didn't dawn on me until after my visits and surgery. He comes in like a whirlwind, leaving little time for introspection. Think about that ... he put his hands on my body, cut into it, and didn't even take the time to say ""Hi! I'm Dr. Ehrnstrom. How are you?"" He even barked at me as he began to give injections into my chest when the surgery started. The pain kind of caught me off-guard, so I raised my left arm. He gruffly said ""Put your arm down.""  My favorite part of the ordeal was how cavalier he was about doing a biopsy when I mentioned I thought a spot looked suspicious. He was ALL over that, and I was stuck with the entire bill. When I addressed it later (saying maybe we should've seen if it was covered first) the office manager kept saying ""That's not how dermatology works."" I LOVE when folks are so quick to spend my money, especially when it costs them nothing. The post-op instructions I received addressed ""if"" I needed to change the dressing, not when. The nurse said the one I had would come off the next day when I showered. I wasn't told in any way, shape or form that I HAD to keep it covered. When that bandage fell off and I saw the 6"" gash across my chest, I knew that wasn't an option. So, I had to get in the car, drive myself to Walgreen's and figure it out. (Which was the last thing I wanted to do the day after surgery. Every time I hit a bump, well, you can imagine.) When I shared this while getting my stitches removed, the PA said ""So what you're telling me is you were inconvenienced."" If she hadn't had sharp utensils a few inches from my face I might have responded stronger. When you live by yourself and have surgery to remove cancer, it's a bit more than an ""inconvenience.""

There were 2 bright spots in the whole thing. Season (one of the nurses) was awesome as was the gentleman in the billing department. They were delightful, and made paying off the remainder of my bill a piece of cake. (Including the damn biopsy.)

If how you're treated doesn't matter and you're happy to just pay for service, this is your place. But know that you are paying for a health transaction, not health care.",Advertisement,Advertisement

We (had) to stay in the overflow parking lot and still had a great time, and easy to do boondocking.  We pretty much had the entire paved parking lot to ourselves which made it nice for our young girls to bike. The paved road inside the campground made it easy for them to bike on too. Great campground for families.

Very clean campground. Staff super friendly. Clean pit toilets. Inteperative center very well done. Easy access to trails for hiking. We saw a black bear üêª! Good views of Denali.

17103,"5 stars for service and atmosphere and a few of my favorite brews. That being said, I dont have much micro brew experience. I know all of our beer tenders and alot of our locals enjoy a pint or 2 after work most days. 2 PINT MAX.  ITS GREAT! Sometimes too noisy but avoid ""HAPPY HOUR"" and afternoons are peaceful and weekends vary. This is a great spot for a short social with friends and pooches ( yes, dogs allowed on a leash and good behavior) and little ones too ( no leash, but well behaved and with parents always) üôÇ. Enjoy a sample if your not sure. Like something and dont want to hang, get a growler to go or a ""medicine bottle"".T shirts, hoodies and souvenir glasses and other swag. You'll have to stop in and see. You may even admire/ purchase artwork from any one of local talented artists. Maybe even say hi to me.

17144,Bad customer service.  Tried explaining to customer service the difference between potable water and portable water. I wanted potable water for my camper but was told they only put it in to water jugs. When I asked why I was told because of contamination.  Contamination?  If the water is contaminated then it is not potable water. No amount of filtration system on my camper could persuade them that I was going to be safe. The worst.,Legitimate,Legitimate
